# Introduction to Python for Data Science

This is a set of notes used for teaching Python to students that have never used Python, or programmed in any language. In a usual semester, it takes approximately 4 weeks (meeting twice a week for an hour) to go through the material, for a freshmen undergraduate class. 

## Recommended Books

* [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book): This is a textbook for students that are learning Python as their first programming language, with the objective of using programming to handle and analyze data. 
* [Automate the Boring Stuff using Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com): A task-driven textbook that teaches Python by focusing on how to automate various tasks, using programming.


## Additional Books for Learning Python

* [How To Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html#t-o-c): An interactive guide to programming and Python. The book "Python for Everybody" (listed above) is partially based on this book.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/): An introduction to programming and Python. It targets complete beginners. It used a drill-based approach for teaching, which can be tedious at times. Nevertheless, it is considered one of the standard textbooks for learning Python.
