We have two data sets under the `data` folder: The list of unique restaurant names from the NYC Restaurant Inspection dataset (`data/restaurants.txt`). We need to write Python code that will read these files and return a list of strings that are the company names.\n",
    "* **Step 2**: We will then need to figure out how to compare two strings and find their similarity. For that, we will write a function that takes as input **two** strings, and returns back their similarities. We will explore multiple ways of writing that function, using various library functions.\n",
    "* **Step 3**: We will need to write a function that takes as input a company name, and returns back a list of matching company names, together with their similarity. Ideally, we would like to also sort the list based on the similarity (highest similarity metrics on top). As part of our learning process, we will use the _list comprehension_ approach to create the list. We will also use tuples as the elements of the list, so that the list contain elements such as `[(\"McDonalds\", 0.88), (\"McDonald's\", 0.81),....]`.\n",
    "* **Step 4**: In the final step, we will just perform the similarity computation across all companies in the dataset."
