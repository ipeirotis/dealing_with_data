    "Below, we will discuss a few of these common patterns. Most of these patterns have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize one or more variables before the loop starts\n",
    "* Perform some computation on each item in the loop body, possibly changing the variables in the body of the loop\n",
    "* Look at the resulting variables when the loop completes"
