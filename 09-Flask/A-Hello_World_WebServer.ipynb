    "## What is Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is a **micro web framework** written in Python and based on the [Werkzeug toolkit](werkzeug.pocoo.org/) and [Jinja2 template engine](jinja.pocoo.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Flask is called a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about Flask can be found on [official web site](http://flask.pocoo.org/).\n",
