All text written in `<input type=\"text\">` will be processed by flask (see below). Attribute `placeholder` contains text that will be positioned in the text input. `<input type=\"submit\">` sends data to backend using POST method (it is one of HTTP request methods; two commonly used methods for a request-response between a client and server are: GET and POST; GET requests data from a specified resource when POST submits data to be processed to a specified resource; additional information you can find [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp)) to the function `submit_new_student()` defined in `action` attribute (we will create it further). \n",
