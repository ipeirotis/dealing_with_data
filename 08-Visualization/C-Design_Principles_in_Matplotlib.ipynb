    "The default font shipped with `matplotlib` is Bitsream Vera Sans, and it's not that pretty. I much prefer Helvetica, and I wrote a [tutorial](http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/post/35807476900/how-to-set-helvetica-as-the-default-sans-serif-font-in) on how to set Helvetica as the default sans-serif font in `matplotlib`. It was originally wrote for Mac OSX users, but the concepts can be used on any system. The basic idea is that you need to either obtain a set of `Helvetica*.tff` files, or extract them from Mac OS X's `Helvetica.dfont` file. Unfortuantely, it's fairly involved, and I will leave the reader to follow the link and use the tutorial.\n",

The following examples use [sparkplot](http://agile.unisonis.com/proj/sparkplot/sparkplot.py) and its introductory [blog post](http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2005/04/sparkplot-creating-sparklines-with.html). For example, if you visualize the wins (red, up) and losses (blue, down) by the Lakers' 2002 season where they won the NBA championships, it is easy to see streaks of wins and losses, ![Lakers' 2002 game series](http://agile.unisonis.com/proj/sparkplot/lakers2002.png). It is also easy to compare to their 2005 performance, where they did not win the championship, ![Lakers' 2005 game series](http://agile.unisonis.com/proj/sparkplot/lakers2005.png). This is a very nice way to visualize binary data.\n",
