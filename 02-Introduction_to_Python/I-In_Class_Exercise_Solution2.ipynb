    "### Matching Company Names\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite often, in our data, we have entries represented as strings that refer to the same entity but have different string representations (e.g., McDonald's vs McDonalds vs McDonald‎). We want to write code that will help in the task of finding such similar entries in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task can be broken in the following tasks:\n",
    "* **Step 1**: Read the data from a file into a list of strings in memory. We have two data sets under the `data` folder: The list of unique restaurant names from the NYC Restaurant Inspection dataset (`data/restaurant-names.txt`) and a list of bank names (`data/bank-names.txt`) We need to write Python code that will read these files and return a list of strings that are the company names.\n",
    "* **Step 2**: We will then need to figure out how to compare two strings and find their similarity. For that, we need to write a function that takes as input two strings, and returns back their similarities (we will see below how to do that).\n",
    "* **Step 3**: We will need to write a function that takes as input a company name, and returns back a list of matching company names, together with their similarity. Ideally, we would like to also sort the list based on the similarity (highest similarity metrics on top). As part of our learning process, we will use the _list comprehension_ approach to create the list. We will also use tuples as the elements of the list, so that the list contain elements such as `[(\"McDonalds\", 0.88), (\"McDonald's\", 0.81),....]`.\n",
    "* **Step 4**: In the final step, we will just perform the similarity computation across all companies in the dataset.\n"

    "### Computing the similarity between two strings\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways that we can calculate the similarity between two strings (e.g., see [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_metric), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching), [3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism_detection), [4](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/papers/ijcai03.pdf), [5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:String_similarity_measures), and links within). \n",
    "\n",
    "For our example, we will use the q-gram similarity metric. What is a q-gram? Simply a sequency of q-consecutive characters in the string. For example, the name \"Panos\" has the following 2-grams: \"Pa\", \"an\", \"no\", \"os\". (We can also add \"#P\" and \"s#\" if we want to capture the prefix and suffixes.) Strings that share a large number of q-grams are often similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we can compute the similarity of two strings by first computing the set of q-grams for each string, and then compute the Jaccard coefficient between these sets. The [Jaccard coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) is simply defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the two sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our task can be broken into two functions: \n",
    "* The first function takes a string and returns a list of the q-grams for the string, and \n",
    "* The second function takes as input two sets, and returns back their Jaccard coefficient."
