    "We've spent some time going into detail about some of the data types and structures available in python. It's now time to talk about how to navigate through some of this data, and use data to make decisions. Traversing over data and making decisions based upon data are a common aspect of every programming language, known as control flow. Python provides a rich control flow, with a lot of conveniences for the power users. Here, we're just going to talk about the basics, to learn more, please [consult the documentation](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "A common theme throughout this discussion of control structures is the notion of a \"block of code.\" Blocks of code are **demarcated by a specific level of indentation**, typically separated from the surrounding code by some control structure elements, immediately preceeded by a colon, `:`. We'll see examples below. \n",

    "Yahoo said certain user account information—including names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers—was stolen from the company’s network in late 2014 by what it believes is a state-sponsored actor.\n",
    "Yahoo said it is notifying potentially affected users and has taken steps to secure their accounts by invalidating unencrypted security questions and answers so they can’t be used to access an account and asking potentially affected users to change their passwords.\n",
    "Yahoo recommended users who haven’t changed their passwords since 2014 do so. It also encouraged users change their passwords as well as security questions and answers for any other accounts on which they use the same or similar information used for their Yahoo account.\n",
    "The company, which is working with law enforcement, said the continuing investigation indicates that stolen information didn't include unprotected passwords, payment-card data or bank account information.\n",
    "With 500 million user accounts affected, this is the largest-ever publicly disclosed data breach, according to Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy with Privacy Rights Clearing House, a not-for-profit group that compiles information on data breaches.\n",
    "No evidence has been found to suggest the state-sponsored actor is currently in Yahoo’s network, and Yahoo didn’t name the country it suspected was involved. In August, a hacker called “Peace” appeared in online forums, offering to sell 200 million of the company’s usernames and passwords for about $1,900 in total. Peace had previously sold data taken from breaches at Myspace and LinkedIn Corp.\n",
