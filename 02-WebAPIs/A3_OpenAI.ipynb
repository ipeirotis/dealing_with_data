        "2.  **Fetch news articles:** Use the `get_company_news` helper function to retrieve articles about your chosen company. Start with a small number of articles (e.g., 3-5) to test your code.\n",
        "3.  **Analyze each article:** Loop through the fetched articles and use the `analyze_article` helper function to get the sentiment, summary, and topics for each one.\n",
        "4.  **Store the results:** Think about how you can store the results of the analysis for each article. A list of dictionaries would be a good approach.\n",
        "5.  **Perform further analysis (Optional but Recommended):**\n",
        "    *   Calculate the average sentiment score across the articles.\n",
        "    *   Identify the most frequent topics.\n",
        "    *   If you fetch articles over a longer period, you could plot the sentiment over time.\n",
