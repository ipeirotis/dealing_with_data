# BigQuery Relevant Data

* The dataset `bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries.states` contains shapefiles for many US areas. Also look at `bigquery-public-data.geo_census_tracts` and `bigquery-public-data.geo_census_blockgroups`
* The dataset `bigquery-public-data.geo_openstreetmap` contains the full data from OpenStreetMap.
* The dataset `nyu-datasets.shapefiles` contains the 2019 TIGER data, together with the "_nowater_" versions.
* The dataset `bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_acs` contains the ACS survey data which can be super helpful when trying to find out various demographic characteristics of our area.
