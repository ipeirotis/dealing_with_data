# TODO

* Consider reading shapefiles from the bigquery public datasets. For example `bigquery-public-data.geo_us_boundaries.states`.
* Consider loading shapefiles in a public Bigquery dataset. The public datasets from Google contain states and counties, but no tracks, blockgroups, or blocks. Also they do not have the "no water" versions.
