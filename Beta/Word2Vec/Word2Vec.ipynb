    "Google's Word2Vec is a deep-learning inspired method that focuses on the meaning of words. Word2Vec attempts to understand meaning and semantic relationships among words. It works in a way that is similar to deep approaches, such as recurrent neural nets or deep neural nets, but is computationally more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Word2Vec tool takes a text corpus as input and produces the word vectors as output. It first constructs a vocabulary from the training text data and then learns vector representation of words. The resulting word vector file can be used as features in many natural language processing and machine learning applications. Word2Vec does not need labels in order to create meaningful representations. This is useful, since most data in the real world is unlabeled. If the network is given enough training data (tens of billions of words), it produces word vectors with intriguing characteristics. Words with similar meanings appear in clusters, and clusters are spaced such that some word relationships, such as analogies, can be reproduced using vector math. The most famous examples of highly trained word vectors are `\"king - man + woman = queen\"` and `\"Paris - France + Italy = Rome\"`.\n",
    " \n",
    "In Python, we will use the excellent implementation of Word2Vec from the [`gensim` package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gensim). If you don't alread y have gensim installed, you'll need to install it using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install gensim\n",
    "    \n",
    "Although Word2Vec does not require graphics processing units (GPUs) like many deep learning algorithms, it is compute intensive. Both Google's version and the Python version rely on multi-threading (running multiple processes in parallel on your computer to save time). In order to train your model in a reasonable amount of time, you will need to install `cython` (instructions [here](http://docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/install.html)). Word2Vec will run without `cython` installed, but it will take days to run instead of minutes."

    "## 2. Bag-of-words mode of text representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can get text of reviews from one HTML file and process then, but how do we convert them to some kind of numeric representation for machine learning, particularly, for text classification as good or bad review or for prediction of which movie was devoted the comment for? One common approach is called a **Bag-of-words**. The Bag-of-words model learns a vocabulary from all of the documents, then models each document by counting the number of times each word appears. For example, consider the following two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sentence 1: \"The cat sat on the hat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sentence 2: \"The dog ate the cat and the hat\"\n",
    "\n",
    "From these two sentences, our vocabulary is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    { the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "\n",
    "To get our bags of words, we count the number of times each word occurs in each sentence. In `Sentence 1`, \"the\" appears twice, and \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", and \"hat\" each appear once, so the feature vector for `Sentence 1` is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    { the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sentence 1: { 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 }\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the features for `Sentence 2` are: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Sentence 2: { 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}\n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src=\"images/bag-of-words.png\" width=75%>\n",
    "    \n",
    "This vector representation does not preserve the order of the words in the original sentences. This kind of representation has several successful applications, for example email filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the `feature_extraction` module from `scikit-learn` to create Bag-of-words features. If you have not `scikit-learn` installed, read [this](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before, we need to split a paragraph into sentences. There are all kinds of gotchas in natural language. English sentences can end with \"?\", \"!\", \"\"\", or \".\", among other things, and spacing and capitalization are not reliable guides either. For this reason, we'll use the Python [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org)'s punkt tokenizer for sentence splitting.  You'll need to [install](http://www.nltk.org/install.html) the library if you don't already have it on your computer"
