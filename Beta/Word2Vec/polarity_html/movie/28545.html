<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The Claim is a great western epic about the building of a frontier
American town and about the pioneer who built that town. It's an homage
to Robert Altman's insightful film, with the same theme, "McCabe and
Mrs. Miller." It was creatively adapted to the screen by English
director Michael Winterbottom (Jude/Welcome to Sarajevo/Wonderland) from
a novel by Thomas Hardy" The Mayor of Casterbridge," as the setting was
changed from England to a snowy gold-mining mountain town in
California's Sierra Nevada mountains called Kingdom Come. The time frame
was in 1867, some 20 years after the gold rush.</P>
<P>The lure of gold has drawn men to this remote and harsh territory, in a
town without a church but one with a prosperous saloon and brothel. The
town is owned by the benign despot, the mayor of the town, Mr. Dillon
(Peter Mullan), who also makes the laws and enforces them with the help
of his right-hand man, Mr. Sweetley (McGinley). Dillon is in his forties
and has a dark secret from some 20 years ago, of how he sold his wife
and young child to a prospector for his claim. It was with that claim
that he struck it rich and built this material empire for himself. His
mistress now is the town's testy brothel owner, Lucia (Jovovich), a
cultured whore of Portugese extraction, with a good head for business.</P>
<P>A caravan of people arrive in town, including an ailing mother and her
attractive twentysomething daughter. The dying mother is named Elena
(Nastassja Kinski). Her blonde daughter is named Hope (Sarah Polley).
They are the wife and daughter that have haunted the prosperous
businessmen ever since he chose wealth over love, using the excuse that
he was always drunk during those days. The mother has never told her
daughter that Dillon is her father, but has instead told her that he's a
relation. They have come here to confront Mr. Dillon in a way that will
not call attention to others why they are here. The dying mother, since
her husband has died and left her broke, wants to make certain Dillon
gives his daughter money so that she doesn't starve.</P>
<P>Also on that caravan is Dalglish (Wes Bentley), a surveyor for the
Central Pacific Railroad. He's important to the town because if the
railroad approves of laying tracks in town that will mean certain
prosperity, but if they choose to bypass the town that means death.
Dalglish is the young Scottish version of Dillon. He's a handsome young
man, who is very ambitious and is capable of doing his task in a
hard-headed business way; he is not fooled by the red carpet treatment
he's given by Dillon as he's offered money, free drinks, free hotel
rooms, and whores. He gladly accepts the women and the booze, but has
trouble with being openly bribed by money. What he knows for certain, is
that he's attracted to the peachy looking Hope. Lucia also finds him
attractive and when disappointed by Dillon's attention going to the two
newly arrived women, she comes onto Dalglish. He prefers Hope, but when
there are obstacles between them he's quite willing to be with Lucia. It
all indicates that even though he's honestly doing his job, he seems to
be someone who has chinks in his armor and might in the future be more
easily corrupted.</P>
<P>The Claim works best as an antitraditional Western epic that presents an
allegorical drama of fate, retribution and redemption. It took a certain
courage for Dillon, the flawed hero of the story, to come out to this
barren land and make something out of it. The next generation to come
out here was represented by the brashness of young Dalglish, who will
have it easier than the pioneers. He will have more to work with, but
the baton has been passed on and he will also have to face his dark side
and see if he can overcome his mistakes and build something that is
worthwhile and lasting. The film might not have been engaging
dramatically at all times, as it parcelled out its long tale reluctantly
in bits and pieces, but it sets a haunting mood relating the lives of
these laconic characters to the building of the country. It shows how
the country consisted of people from all over the world who had dreams
of success. In The Claim these pioneers and emigrants are Scottish,
Polish, Irish, and Portuguese. These are the builders of America who
found sanctuary in the snow-covered mountain town and brought
civilization to the country, even though they did it in such a violent
and messy way. The Claim also does not forget the English influence on
these settlers, this is shown by a poem being read from Shelley's
"Ozymandias."</P>
<P>The film is satisfying because it remains elusive as to what the
ingredient for success and happiness is, as each character wants
something else in their American Dream. This is a country where
individual freedom is cherished, and this film does that concept a great
honor by not trivializing that dream to be the same for everyone. It
shows how a successful town could live with a diverse population, a
whorehouse, a church, and gold-mining camps.</P>
<P>There are a number of striking visual scenes; such as, the train passing
through the breathtaking mountain landscape, which indicates what a
difficult chore it must have been to lay tracks in that location. A
surreal shot of a horse on fire galloping on the mountain snow. Another
great shot was the house moving of Dillon's Victorian house, a tribute
to the workforce in the community who rallied together to support one
another in a time of need.</P>
<P>The Scottish actor Peter Mullen gave a wonderfully restrained
performance, convincing as the man who did wrong and doesn't know how to
make things right except by trying to when given a second chance. Sarah
Polley is a marvelous young Canadian actress, whose stubborn girlish
behavior comes to a climax when she falls in love and begins to
understand her mother in a way she couldn't before; circumstances have
changed so rapidly when she learns about her mother's secret and she is
on her own out of necessity.</P>
<P>As in "McCabe...," there's a gloomy ending that reflects on how
disasterous and empty a life of greed is. It's a bleak film that manages
to give one hope for a situation that seems hopeless, and that is the
strength of this very enriching film. It has captured a slice of the
American West from a book that was written as an English period piece.</P>
