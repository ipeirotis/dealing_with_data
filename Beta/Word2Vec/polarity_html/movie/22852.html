<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Possibly the best British noir film ever made, a film adapted from the
Graham Greene novel. It is a vicious story of a sadistic teenage
baby-faced gangster, Pinkie Brown (Richard Attenborough), who works a
protection racket around the racecourses in the seaside resort of
Brighton. The tourist bureau was so afraid that this gloomy look at
Brighton would scare off tourists, that the film opens with a "crawl"
telling what a safe and jolly playground community Brighton now is.</P>
<P>At the lair of the 17-year-old Pinkie's mob, are his older henchmen, who
tell him that an unimportant journalist Kolley Kibber 'alias' Fred Hale
(Wheatley) is visiting Brighton. He gets his picture in the newspaper
and as the newspaper article mentions that his visit has to do with him
passing out cards in hidden spots that if found the finder will get paid
for it. Kollee inadvertently caused the death of a former Brighton gang
leader, Kite - the only person for whom Pinkie has ever felt affection.
Pinkie decides to go after him with his mob and meets up with him in one
of the bars, where he puts a fright on him.</P>
<P>Kolley is trying to flee back to London after that incident but sees
that he is being followed by Pinkie's gang. In the bar, for his
protection, he tries to get acquainted with a bosomy, beer-guzzling,
loud-laughing singer, Ida Arnold (Hermione Baddeley), who has a short
engagement with one of the shows performing on the boardwalk. She sees
that Fred is scared out of his wits and that he wants her to not leave
his side. When he meets her later on at the boardwalk and pays for some
seats to get some sun, he begs her to stay with him, he even gives the
woman who is short on cash some money to buy tickets for the train so
that they can go home together. When she leaves him for a moment, he
sees Pinkie's men coming for him and rushes into "The Ghost Train" ride
to elude his pursuers. Inside the tunnel he recognizes that his fellow
passenger is Pinkie. His body is washed up on the beach some time later
and the police rule the death as a heart attack. But Pinkie is afraid
that one of his men, Spicer (Wylie Watson), while trying to help him,
took Kibber's cards and placed one of them under a tablecloth in a
restaurant, and this might come back to haunt him if the police later on
believe they are dealing with a murder and a witness comes forward to
recognize who put the card there. The cunning youngster wants absolutely
no witnesses to his crime.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Ida is convinced that Fred was killed. She performs some kind
of magical ritual which spells out Fred's death as a possible suicide
and of Fred calling out for help, with her believing in this
superstitious practice over the conventional disciplines of knowledge:
religion and science. She goes to the police asking them to investigate
this death as a murder case, but they tell her that there is no evidence
of that. She tells them, I will go after the killer because "I believe
in right and wrong."</P>
<P>Ida becomes an allegorical figure in the film, a do-gooder, who
represents the popular mass culture, someone Graham Greene had no love
for. In fact, he is more sympathetic to the killer in the film, no
matter that he is a certifiable maniac.While Pinkie is a psychopath, who
rejects all goodness in people and enjoys inflicting pain on others,
being a cross between a bully and a cringing child afraid of the dark,
at least he stands for something real- which is, evil. In his twisted
way, he is a Catholic, hating atheists, because the church's strict
dogmas are more real to him than Ida's banal humanism.</P>
<P>Pinkie returns to the restaurant and strikes up a relationship with the
inexperienced 17-year-old waitress, Rose (Marsh), who is taken with the
bravado of Pinkie and falls in love with him, not caring how rotten he
is, as long as he loves her.</P>
<P>Pinkie is overmatched by the big-time gangster in Brighton, Colleoni
(Goldner), who tells him there isn't room for the two of them in
Brighton, warning Pinkie to stay away from his clients. Pinkie sees this
as an opportunity to knock off Spicer, as he warns the Colleoni  gang
about Spicer interfering with their operation. At the racetrack, they
slice Spicer up, but also get Pinkie slashed in the face. Not realizing
that Spicer escaped, he is told by his drunken, washed-up, crooked
lawyer for the gang, Prewitt (Harcourt), that Spicer is here to see him.
In a rage, Pinkie tosses old man Spicer over the banister to his death,
and gets Prewitt to swear that it was an accident.</P>
<P>Pinkie is frightened about being uncovered, even though he can't stand
Rose, he decides to have the crooked lawyer fix it so that the underaged
couple could be legally married in a civil ceremony, therefore she can
no longer be a witness against him. Rose, being a Catholic, wanted a
church wedding and is late to the wedding ceremony having gone to church
to get sanctified, as if only the church can make her soul clean.</P>
<P>Ida is now convinced that Rose is in danger from Pinkie, and states,
"I've got to save her, even if she doesn't want to be saved." The film
turns into a suspension between melodrama and farce, as Ida becomes the
amateur detective, visiting Prewitt's chaotic office, where from next
door there is heard loud music drowning out her conversation with him,
as she futilely tries to convince him to turn Pinkie in for the two
murders. This very serious part of the film was also extremely comical,
as the lawyer whose only humanity he has left is from quoting
Shakespeare and the vulgar bar singer, who is trying to save the world
from an evil she can't even comprehend as also lying within herself, try
to communicate with each other. She is blind to what goes for good taste
and is consumed by what is popularly believed and assumed to be right.
He is too far gone, to do anything about what is right or wrong in the
world.</P>
<P>On the boardwalk together, Rose wants an affirmation from Pinkie that he
loves her, and seeing a voice message booth, urges Pinkie to make a
recording so that she will always have his voice on record. When he goes
into the booth, he shuts her out and starts to record: "What you want me
to say is I love you." Instead, he goes into a diatribe telling her how
she disgusts him and how much he hates her. She holds onto this as a
wedding present, hoping to get a chance to listen to it even though she
doesn't have a gramophone.</P>
<P>When Ida tracks down where Rose is honeymooning, she tells the young
bride that her husband killed two people. Rose only cares that he loves
her, and tells Ida that people change and repent.  Ida shoots back that
people never change-"I haven't."</P>
<P>The persistent Ida runs into Pinkie's crony Dallow (Hartnell) in the
boardwalk bar; he listens to what she says and he helps her only because
he warned Pinkie that he wants no harm to come to Rose. When he realizes
that Pinkie, in the driving rain, has taken Rose down to the end of the
pier and plans to kill her, he has the cops called and gives chase after
Pinkie himself. They catch hold of Pinkie just as he has talked Rose
into a suicide pact, with her to be taking her life first, even as she
believes suicide is a sin, she demonstrates that she is willing to do
anything for the one she loves. But when the police show up she throws
the gun in the water and Dallow comes after Pinkie, who stumbles to his
death by cowardly falling off the pier onto the ocean.</P>
<P>The last scene in the film is one of those memorable ones that just
can't be easily forgotten. It has a raw power in it that a noir film
commands when the dark side of human nature unfolds so suddenly
onscreen, even if the scene was changed from the one in Greene's novel.
After Pinkie's demise, the black waters by the pier dissolve and the
next shot is in a brightly lit room in a Catholic home for pregnant
teens. A nun wearing lipstick is seen comforting the pregnant Rose, who
feels she should have died with her husband. She is crying out, "I don't
want absolution!" Further saying, "I got his voice-I got proof of his
love." The nun, looking at the phonograph by the girl's side, says in a
grave voice, "There is always hope, it is in the air we breath. We have
to hope and pray. Love can bring about salvation." When Rose puts the
record on, we have already heard what Pinkie said and wait to see her
reaction, but when she plays the record: "What you want me to say is I
love you," the record gets stuck and plays that over and over, until the
final shot of the film is of the crucifix on the wall, with Rose,
seemingly, elated to have her love reaffirmed by such a positive proof.
This cynical ending is perfect. The filmmakers thought it could be
construed as possibly a happy ending for the filmgoers who thrive on a
happy ending overcoming the general despair of the film. But the film
was a failure at the box office.</P>
<P>The only weakness in the film was the awkward pacing of the story and
the over inflated role of Hermione Baddeley. It was a brassy portrayal
that detracted from the noir mood of the film. Richard Attenborough's
manic performace as a psychopathic, androgynous character, who had
violent mood swings, was pulsatingly brilliant. His sadomasochistic
relationship with the naive Rose, coupled with dark shots of the seamy
side of Brighton, plus the expressionistic studio shots, gave the film a
raw energy that makes it more powerful than the usual gangster film. If
you have any kind of feel for noir films, this one is in the don't miss
category.</P>
