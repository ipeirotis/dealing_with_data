<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Two things could be said for sure about this movie, which uses mostly
nonprofessional actors, that it is disturbingly romantic and it is
troublingly inconclusive. It tells a nonlinear, fantasy story, and it
does so by stunning visualizations that capture the importunate
moodiness about a boy and a girl, both of whom are outcasts, living in
the beautiful French Riviera region of Côte d'Azur. It stylishly picks
up the angst of the two passive teens, loners, who are prone to
violence, boredom, sex, alienation, theft, and mental unbalance. There
is no telling narrative to sink one's teeth into the story, but the
visceral images and the emptiness of the youth's quest are fully
explored in an original way, by the first-time director, Manuel Pradal.</P>
<P>Metaphors abound in this film, so much so that one could overdose on all
the heavily intended poetical images and still not find much to sate
one's hunger for what this film is ultimately about, which becomes the
film's major fault. It starts off by making the beautiful landscape
(ocean vistas and richly adorned hills) a metaphor and contrasting that
with the ugly souls of all the young people in the film. The landmark
rising out of the water from two million years ago in the Baie des Anges
becomes the main metaphor for the film, as the bay near Nice has two
spurs of jutting rocks called angel wings that are shaped like shark
fins-- which have deterred invaders from coming ashore throughout the
centuries, as their ships get shipwrecked when navigating on these
waters. Also, once a year, the custom used to be that a child had to be
sacrificed to appease the Gods. If you want something that is
predictable about this unpredictable film, you have it here, you can bet
your popcorn money that before the film is over some innocent kid will
get it.</P>
<P>If you want to read some politics into this film, you might say that the
director was using  the local American navy base as a metaphor, showing
the mixed-reaction it gets from the locals, as he tried to get at what
the local reactions to the base are by showing that there is an
undercurrent of disrespect and lack of trust for each other. The French
locals are viewed as being thieves, dirty juvenile delinquent-types, and
stupid by the Americans, while the locals view the sailors as violent,
filthy rich, disrespectful of their girls, and unable to speak French
fluently.</P>
<P>Marie (Vahina Giocante, who is a professional ballet dancer-in the Opera
de Marseilles), is the troubled 15-year-old girl who is fascinated with
picking up American sailors at the local navy base, despite some of the
apprehensions she has about their sexual aggressiveness.  Orso (Frederic
Malgras) is a nonprofessional actor, who plays the troubled 17-year-old,
the one seeking a gun, cast as a marginalized local. He falls for Marie
and goes on a strange and empty romantic idyll with her.</P>
<P>The pair seem suitable for each other, as their desperate lives keep
intersecting, and the two misfits continually pull each other out of
predicaments. Nothing is told about their family history and where they
come from. They have no conversations. It is as if they came out of
nowhere and are only figments of our imagination. The mystery about
them, gives them a Camus-like sense of existentialism, it is as if the
more modern the story tries to be, the more it can be seen rooted in an
old philosophy, a philosophy of fatalism.</P>
<P>The beauty in the film is from the never stopping camerawork, picking up
one beautiful scene after another, though what connection this all has
to do with the movie is anyone's guess. As I thought this film was about
loners versus the group psychology prevailing, whereas the loners can't
function with any kind of social measure because their troubling souls
can find no place in modern French society to fit in. The trouble with
that pat explanation of the film, is that the film doesn't help itself
any by overloading the imagery, so that if one wanted to, there could by
many other explanations for what the film was about. After a certain
point, that becomes an annoying feature of the film, as the two teens
lose their humanity and seem to be only symbols for what the director
was trying to say. This is possible because of there persistent silence
and lack of character development.</P>
<P>Marie is seen erotically dancing in front of the sailors and then again
in front of a boat owner and his son, where she distracts them so that
Orso could steal their boat and the two of them use the boat to go on an
exotic picnic together. Orso lives by robbing houses and is a peripheral
hanger-on with the locals. She has been rejected by the locals for
choosing to go after the sailors, who lure her with their money and
forbidden sex, taking her to nightclubs, but the sailors reject her
after having sex with her, and brutally throw her away from them when
they had what they wanted from her, calling her a whore.</P>
<P>The point of the story is, that these two losers have found each other
and want to share their disturbed lives together without judgment and
modification. Aside from being a stunning film to watch, I could see no
beauty in its dark character portrayal of the lovers and the film's
overall pessimistic attitudes toward youth. The film had too many
missing ingredients in it for it to be impactful; I could hardly
remember the main characters just a week later after seeing the film,
only remembering how alluring Vahina Giocante was and how beautiful the
South of France looks.</P>
