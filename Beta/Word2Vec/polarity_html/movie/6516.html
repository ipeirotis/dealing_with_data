<P>     Just in case you think the term "soccer mom" was nothing but a
convenient demographic catch-phrase for the 1996 presidential election,
ONE FINE DAY presents Michelle Pfeiffer as an in-the-flesh soccer mom, and
her life is every bit as complicated as we have been led to believe.  In
between frying the bacon up in a pan and bringing it home, she has to deal
with child care dilemmas, unsympathetic co-workers and sleep deprivation.
It's one frantic day, all right, one that is equally frantic for "soccer
dad" George Clooney, and it begins to turn ONE FINE DAY into a
soci-political spin on PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES.  Unfortunately,
this is supposed to be a romantic comedy, and the romance is dropped into
this unfocused piece of work like an afterthought.</P>
<P>     Pfeiffer plays Melanie Parker, a divorced architect with a 6-year-old
son named Sammy (Alex D. Linz) and a very tight schedule ahead of her.
She is also responsible for bringing Sammy's classmate Maggie Taylor (Mae
Whitman) to school, and the schedule becomes even tighter when Maggie does
not show up on time.  That is because Maggie's mother has left her with
ex-husband Jack Taylor (Clooney), a cocky investigative reporter with a
somewhat cavalier attitude about parenting.  When both kids miss the bus
to a field trip, Jack and Melanie are stuck with their children though
both have little time to spare.  Out of sheer desperation, the pair end up
helping each other out with the kids, despite an apparent antagonism.
That antagonism begins to change into something else throughout the day,
as Jack and Melanie are forced to re-consider their priorities.</P>
<P>     If the idea of ONE FINE DAY is simply to show us how tough single
parents have it, then I suppose it does its job.  Both Jack and Melanie
lose and re-find the children with some regularity, both are forced to
make compromises and both find that working through their own relationship
issues is the last thing they have time for.  ONE FINE DAY is basically a
string of crises of varying magnitude, and while a few are amusing, the
cumulative effect inspires more anxiety than chuckles.  Sammy is a
particularly distressing case, a boy in desperate need of attention who
drives his mother to tears with his inability to stay in one place and
cause no damage.  With inserts of clocks consistently reminding us of
impending deadlines, ONE FINE DAY delivers the nerve-wracking realism of
impossible demands without leavening it with enough humor.</P>
<P>     It also delivers very little romance, and that's a shame, because
Pfeiffer and Clooney click in the few moments they actually share the
screen.  There is a pat quality to the contemporary urban
battle-of-the-sexes banter -- think WHEN HARRY MET SALLY AT THE DAY CARE
CENTER -- but neither star cranks up the sniping to an aggravating livel.
Clooney may not have the best comic timing (or hairdresser) in the world,
but he has an affable charm as the irresponsible Jack, and Pfeiffer's
attempts to maintain her dignity while wearing a dinosaur T-shirt to a
business meeting are equally winning.  In the film's final fifteen
minutes, when Melanie and Jack finally get a chance to take a breath,
there is a casual sexiness which finally seems in keeping with Natalie
Merchant's torchy rendering of the Carole King/Gerry Goffin title song
which opens the film.  By the time you get there, however, you may be
nearly as exhausted as Melanie and Jack.</P>
<P>     Director Michael Hoffman (SOAPDISH, RESTORATION) has made some
interesting films with a lot going on in them, but ONE FINE DAY is a case
where he just wasn't able to tame the script (by Terrel Seltzer and Ellen
Simon).  Somewhere in there is an energetic little modern romance, but it
gets buried under the side tracks of Melanie and Jack's respective
occupational dilemmas, to the point where a press conference where Jack
nails a corrupt politician is set up as the film's climax.  You may be
startled when you realize that there is still a lot of ONE FINE DAY left
to go, time for it to deliver at last the relationship it teased you with  
in trailers, posters, and ninety minutes of running time.  By that point
it has become clear that, like its protagonists, ONE FINE DAY is too busy
for something as mundane as a relationship when there are jobs to do, kids
to watch and, yes, soccer games to attend.</P>
