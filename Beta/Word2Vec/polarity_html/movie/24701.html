<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A noble idea for a film to satire some of the best known American pop
culture heroes of the 1950s, as directed by the Britisher Nicolas Roeg,
from a Terry Johnson play conceived in 1982. In 1954, the filmmaker
fantasizes, what would have happened if Marilyn Monroe (Theresa
Russell), Albert Einstein (Michael Emil), Joe DiMaggio (Gary Busey), and
Senator Joseph McCarthy (Tony Curtis) met in a hotel room in New York
City on one blistering hot day. The film often misses the target, but
since it throws everything into the mix, it sometimes is delightfully on
target, providing both amusement and thought-provoking reactions.</P>
<P>The fictionalized encounters, which try to capture the essence of the
pop culture characters rather than depicting them as real-life
characters, though using what knowledge the public has of them, the
characterizations seem pretty close to the truth. It shows the icons
concerned about the following topics: fame, vanity, communism vs. the
free world, world peace, jealousy, Freud, love, The Theory of
Relativity, the physical appearance of the universe, the A-bomb, hatred,
and freedom of speech.</P>
<P>What really makes this film work, are the excellent performances by the
stars. Michael Emil makes for a fine childlike genius, wearing a
sweatshirt with the block letter P for Princeton emblazed on it. He sits
in the hotel room late at night working on his Field Theory, when who
should pop in, but Marilyn Monroe looking for an intelligent
conversation with Einstein. She has just finished shooting her famous
scene from The Seven Year Itch, where a wind gush under a NYC subway
grating, blows her skirt up and one can see her panties. Marilyn is the
life of the film, presenting a sexy and engaging sex goddess, who is
both vulnerable and pushy.</P>
<P>The genius and the sexpot sit and talk about The Theory of Relativity,
which Marilyn accurately explains by a demonstration of toys and a
flashlight on the floor. She then says she learned it without
understanding it. Einstein is upset by that, mentioning that knowledge
isn't something that is true-- it's just an agreement made by people
that makes it seem true. He says that real knowledge comes about by
turning over possibilities, which is the method of thinking about
things.</P>
<P>Gary Busey is the chain-smoking Yankee Clipper, who can't understand the
starlet and her psychological problems that revolve around her
insecurities and the hatred of her step-mother, but is jealously in love
with her. He comes at 3 A.M. banging on the professor's hotel room door
expecting his wife, who has not been with him for the last two weeks, of
having another extra-marital affair. He is portrayed as a buffoon,
self-absorbed with his fame and baseball achievements, with the running
gag that he is someone who loves collecting bubble gum baseball cards of
himself. Marilyn calls him stupid, complaining she never had an
intelligent conversation with him. Somehow Emil, Busey, and Theresa
survive the night, with Emil voluntarily leaving his room for another in
the hotel to placate the jealous baseball slugger.</P>
<P>For my money, the best scene in the film was in the brief contact
between Will Samson, as the proud Cherokee elevator attendant, taking
Einstein to a room on a different floor. When Einstein tells him that
the Indians believe that wherever they stand is the center of the
universe and Samson responds that he just eats hot dogs and goes up and
down all day in the elevator, an interesting conversation ensues from
that, with the Indian suggesting that Einstein is really a Cherokee
because of his views.</P>
<P>The most terrifying carrier of world gloom, is Tony Curtis, as the
witch-hunting junior senator from Wisconsin, Joseph McCarthy, who is in
Einstein's room to subpoena him to testify before his House of
Un-American Committee. He is shown as a repressed Catholic,  a
hypocrite, a boozer, an anti-Semite, a paranoid nutcase who is hell-bent
through his powers in the senate to head a committee that sniffs out
people he doesn't feel comfortable about by naming them as commies and
thereby ruining their careers. Einstein says he will go to his World
Peace conference and will not testify before the senator's committeee,
which challenges the senator's authority.</P>
<P>The film is a bit of a mess, with no certain plot and it seems to have
no particular aim it hopes to accomplish. But as a diverting look at
these fantasies of the four 1950 icons, it makes for provocative theater
and in the process, it sometimes offers us some inspired thoughts to
think about. It sort of sucks you along for its ride and you don't mind
going along because its kind of fun to imagine how those characters
really were. The film's efforts might be comparable to a guy fantasizing
how it would be to sleep with Marilyn Monroe.</P>
