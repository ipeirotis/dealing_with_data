<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Writer-director Harmony Korine (Gummo), the former skateboarder who
wrote the screenplay for Kids, likes to do his own thing in films. His
auteur signature is to create shocking scenes and characters who will
try to freak the audience out. This in-your-face film is about attitude.
I can't say that I enjoyed it, or found it interesting, but I can say
that I found it different...and, it didn't box me in as to how I was to
view the characters, letting me make up my own mind as to how I wanted
to feel about them. Yet Korine didn't seem to trust all this poetry he
was spreading about and needs to end the film in a conventional way,
with a dramatic scene regarding the pregnancy of Chloe Sevigny.</P>
<P>Korine shot it on digital video and transferred it to film according to
the rules of Dogma 95.</P>
<P>The film is an anti-narrative and linear work. It sets its sights on a
dysfunctional family, living together in Queens, by following them
around to see their everyday existence, while encouraging impromptu
situations and dialogue. Julien (Ewen Bremner) is a mentally unbalanced
21-year-old , who has conversations with himself often repeating what he
says while his arms are flailing. There is an amusing sketch with him
having an imaginary conversation with his houseguest Adolph Hitler. He
is prone to babbling, drooling, and acting outrageous in a harmless way.
He also has some nifty gold false teeth he takes in-and-out of his
mouth. His ballerina and pirouetting ice-skating sister Pearl (Chloe
Sevigny-the real-life girlfriend of Korine) is seven months pregnant
with julien's child. She will call julien from one of the rooms in their
middle-class two-story brickhouse, pretending to be his dead mother,
offering him words of love and comfort. His abusive father (Werner
Herzog-German experimental director) has a few screws loose himself and
tries to be the disciplinarian in the family when he isn't wearing his
gas mask and listening to bluegrass music, or drinking cough medicine
from a slipper. He forces julien to be hosed down in cold water -- which
he does because he wants his son to act like a man -- telling him a
winner doesn't shiver. The most sane one in the household is the high
school student brother of julien's, Chris (Evan Neumann), who is not
overflowing with brains. He is a physical fitness nut and is seen in one
scene wrestling with julien, and from time to time he is seen doing a
weird work-out routine, whereby he climbs the stairs by using only his
upper body. He also is subject to his father's drunken discipline and
miserly love, as are the other children.</P>
<P>A host of characters infiltrate the film for some quick laughs, but, as
odd as they were, they seemed like the type of people the family members
would be acquainted with, so the scenes with them didn't appear to be as
much a freak show as it was a way to make the film entertaining. But the
problem was, they didn't go with the flow of the film, as their
eccentric behavior seemed forced. Some of them include a handless man
who does card tricks and plays the drums with his feet; some blind and
retarded youngsters from the school julien works at, whom he hangs out
with at a bowling alley and they are seen as spastics to be laughed at;
a black albino rapper from Alabama ranting about doing your thing; and,
there is a wonderful scene, with julien and his family at a Pentecostal
church, getting into the Jesus thing Southern style, with julien having
a tear roll down his face while into jumping up and down like the
emotional minister and the black congregation.</P>
<P>In the film's most dramatic moment, towards the end of the movie, Pearl
trips while at an ice rink and has a miscarriage. Julien goes to the
hospital and steals the dead fetus, taking it home on the bus and
cuddling up with it under the covers when in his bed.</P>
<P>I appreciate the effort for originality attempted here, especially with
the abundance of formula mainstream and indie films pushed at the
public, but I would like to see something more intellectually demanding
than just a rant against conventional filmmaking. The filmmaking skills
are there, but as of yet, I don't see the 25-year-old director moving
too far from the childish shock scenes he threw at the audience for his
first film. Mr. Korine dedicated this film to his Uncle Eddie, a patient
at the Creedmore Psychiatric Center in Queens Village, and the film's
central character julien is a schizophrenic modeled in a loving way
after his uncle. I'm sure the director meant well by this
characterization and that is not where I have difficulty with this film,
my difficulty is that the novelty of hearing the incomprehensible
chatter of julien soon wore off and the film seemed to grow vacuous and
became more a technical film addressing how Korine can fool those Dogma
95 people by putting in shots with artificial light, which he did
numerous times, by breaking the rules he promised to fulfill when
getting his Dogma 95 certificate, then it was a film about ideas. I
would much rather he had made a more substantial film rather than making
another anti-intellectual indie film, mainly showing off his superior
knowledge of digital video techniques...but offering no real insights
into the mentally unbalanced characters deeper than what is seen on the
surface. There is still too much skateboarder braggadocio in him and not
enough filmmaker...but the future holds a lot of promise for this
talented filmmaker.</P>
