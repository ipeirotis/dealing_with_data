<P>     It's something of a mystery how three accomplished comic actresses 
like Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, and Better Midler found themselves in 
the midst of an atrocious mess like THE FIRST WIVES CLUB.  My best guess 
is that the story looked better -- much better -- on paper.  After all, 
the premise -- a trio of women getting revenge on the husbands who 
dumped them for younger women -- sounds like a good idea for a truly 
biting satire.  Unfortunately, although there are a few nasty thorns 
here and there, THE FIRST WIVES CLUB is a largely uninspired (and 
unfunny) comedy that collapses completely in the final fifteen minutes.  
The saccharine ending will threaten to send even a mildly cynical viewer 
into sugar shock.</P>
<P>     The three abandoned women are Annie (Keaton), a meek housewife who 
has been going to a therapist for assertiveness training; Elise (Hawn), 
an Academy-Award winning actress; and Brenda (Midler), the loud-mouthed 
mother of a teenage boy.  Once fast friends, they  have grown apart over 
the years, but are reunited following the suicide of another college 
pal.  After discovering how much they have in common, they decide to 
avenge themselves upon the cads to whom they gave the best years of 
their lives:  Annie's Aaron (Stephen Collins), who deserted his wife for 
her psychologist (Marcia Gay Harden); Elise's Bill (Victor Garber), who 
is currently hanging out with a very young starlet (Elizabeth Berkley, 
showing considerably less than in SHOWGIRLS); and Brenda's Morty, who's 
engaged to a vapid social-climber (Sarah Jessica Parker).  The first 
wives' sitcom-like plans for "justice" involve causing severe financial 
distress to each of their ex's, and, to that end, they employ the aid of 
an important socialite (Maggy Smith), an interior decorator (Bronson 
Pinchot), Annie's lesbian daughter (Jennifer Dundas), and a mob boss 
(Philip Bosco).</P>
<P>     THE FIRST WIVES CLUB probably would have been tolerable had any of 
the characters attained even a marginal level of likeability.  But none 
of the major players is remotely sympathetic, and, about halfway through 
the film, I started wishing for the end credits so I could get away from 
these people.  The first wives are shrill and irritating; it's no wonder 
their husbands dumped them.  Of course, the men are just as bad -- self-
centered, dumb, and shallow.  And, unsurprisingly, the "replacement 
women" are bimbos -- bodies without brains.  The only enjoyable 
characters are the secondary ones, like Annie's daughter.  (In her case,  
I'll give the film some credit for presenting a positive, if 
superficial, portrayal of a lesbian.)  The "male bashing" charge likely 
to be leveled at this movie is unfair -- Robert Harling's script is 
equally unkind to men and women.</P>
<P>     An underlying theme of THE FIRST WIVES CLUB addresses society's 
negative perception of middle-aged women, that "worth" and desirability 
vanish with graying hair.  And, while this is a shameful cultural 
problem, the film's preachy approach doesn't offer any new insights.  
There are a few witty jabs at Hollywood's obsession with the beauty of 
"anorexic teenagers".  In Elise's words, the industry is interested in 
three types of women:  "babes, district attorneys, and Driving Miss 
Daisys."  Had the movie sharpened more such well-targeted barbs and 
taken a few risks, THE FIRST WIVES CLUB might have been fun.  As it is, 
however, the screenplay is lifeless, and the Hugh Wilson's (GUARDING 
TESS) direction is flat.  As for the non-verbal humor -- well, if you're 
amused by the idea of Keaton, Hawn, and Midler sneaking out of a high-
rise apartment onto a window-washer's platform, then maybe this is your 
kind of movie.  It's not mine.</P>
<P>     Despite the dross they're forced to work with, the leading women do 
their best to make us believe they've struck gold.  There are even a few 
times when we almost believe them.  Ultimately, though, the material's 
poor quality defeats even the combined skills of Keaton, Hawn, and 
Midler.  There are a number of interesting cameos (including Ed Koch, 
Heather Locklear, and Ivana Trump), but the one who gets the best deal 
is Stockard Channing.  She appears in an early scene, drowning her 
sorrows in booze.  What makes her lucky, however, is that she gets to 
jump off a balcony before the memory of the opening credits has grown 
cold.  By not having to stick around for the next ninety minutes, she's 
granted a reprieve that many in the audience are sure to envy.</P>
