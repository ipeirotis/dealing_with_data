<PRE>                                   GREEDY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Michael J. Fox, Kirk Douglas, Nancy Travis, Olivia D'Abo,
Phil Hartman, Ed Begley Jr., Jere Burns.
Screenplay:  Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel.
Director:  Jonathan Lynn.</P>
<P>     I prefer my comedy with an edge.  THE WAR OF THE ROSES, RUTHLESS
PEOPLE, and TV's "The Simpsons" show that sometimes nothing is funnier
than human nature at its nastiest.  It is also the case that few comedy
conventions irritate me more than starting with an edge and
progressively dulling it with warm-fuzziness.  So here comes GREEDY, a
promising enough comedy about avaricious relatives, but that fact that
it was written by the popular team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel
(SPLASH, PARENTHOOD, CITY SLICKERS) should have clued me in that it
wouldn't go for the jugular.  There are fewer big laughs than in any of
those films, as a largely uninteresting cast tries gamely to support a
limp story.</P>
<P>     GREEDY describes most members of the McTeague family, who want to
get their hands on the millions of scrap metal king Joe McTeague (Kirk
Douglas).  Nephews Frank (Phil Hartman), Carl (Ed Begley Jr.) and Glen
(Jere Burns) and their families are among those who make weekly trips
to Uncle Joe's mansion, kissing up to the sickly old man and tearing
each other down in an attempt to become his sole heir.  There is a new
obstacle on their latest visit:  Molly (Olivia D'Abo), a nubile young
pizza delivery girl who has become Uncle Joe's live-in "nurse."
Desperate to avoid being aced out, the family locates favorite nephew
Danny (Michael J. Fox), an earnest professional bowler who avoids the
family and its in-fighting.  They promise Danny a cut of the
inheritance of he can get rid of Molly, a deal which initially disgusts
Danny.  However, he gradually gets sucked in to the greedy McTeague
world, much to the consternation of girlfriend Robin (Nancy Travis).</P>
<P>     When it did work, GREEDY let its nasty characters be their
nastiest.  The opening fifteen minutes, focusing on one of the McTeague
family's Saturday gatherings, offered a lot of laughs as they took
turns revealing embarrassing secrets about each other to Uncle Joe.
Unfortunately, none of the laughs are as big as they could have been,
and that's primarily because Ganz and Mandel don't provide their
characters with distinct personalities, except for Siobhan Fallon's
horrendously overboard drunk as Hartman's wife.  They're all sort of
interchangeably grasping, and Hartman, Begley and Burns don't have
enough manic energy on their own.  While several of the lines are
funny, none of the characters is funny enough to give them a big push.</P>
<P>     After that early scene, GREEDY loses almost all of the bite it
might have had.  Michael J. Fox does a fine job of setting up the
insecurity which will make Danny vulnerable to the influence of his
family, but he isn't given the chance to sink his teeth into his own
greed.  Either director Jonathan Lynn or Fox himself wouldn't
completely allow Danny to get nasty.  The result is that nothing he
does seems particularly deserving of rebuke; when he tells his
distraught girlfriend that he's just acting in Uncle Joe's best
interest, I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.
Similarly, Olivia D'Abo is supposed to play a corrupted innocent, but
it's hard to recognize where she changes because her character is never
defined from the outset.  Apparently changing from a bikini to a
macrame body suit is supposed to signal moral degredation.  GREEDY
wimps out when it should be emphasizing lust for money is damaging its
characters.</P>
<P>     A simpler and more relevant criticism of GREEDY is that it really
doesn't do anything new.  Greedy relatives and fights for an
inheritance are film staples, and most previous attempts have handled
the subject better.  By its conclusion, GREEDY had become sort of a
recycled WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, as Michael J. Fox has
to decide what to do with his particular Everlasting Gobstopper.
GREEDY does offer a few giggles, but they get buried under a fairly
self-evident message and a slow, unoriginal story.  GREEDY is like a
bottle of acid diluted in far too much water:  it's just not corrosive
enough.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 greedy relatives:  4.</PRE>
