<P>     The first hour is exciting.  Before his character ever draws blood,
Robert De Niro cuts a chilling figure as an edgy knife salesman (!)
whose life is increasingly in shambles.  He can't make the numbers at
work, his ex-wife is threatening him with a restraining order, and, now,
his favorite baseball team's expensive new addition (Wesley Snipes) is
hitting his first slump.  What's a psychotic fan to do?  In these
expertly shot early scenes, director Tony Scott (CRIMSON TIDE, TOP GUN)
generates tension in the most unlikely of places.  Who else would film a
car-phone conversation like a high- speed chase?  About the time that De
Niro's character gets down to business, though, the suspense starts
seeping away.  Major dramatic events happen, but they don't register.
Plausibility wanes, tension fades, and, finally, we're left holding the
umbrella during one howler of a rain-soaked night game.  The finale is
so bad-- so jaw-dropping awful-- that even Marge Schott might be at a
loss for words.  Other umpires might call it differently, but I say THE
FAN is *out*!</P>
