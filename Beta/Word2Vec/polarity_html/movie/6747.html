<P>     Early publicity for BEVERLY HILLS NINJA offered reasons for 
optimism.  Print ads released last summer trumpeted the starring duo of 
Chris Farley, the heir apparent to John Candy's brand of "big man" 
humor, and Jackie Chan, the human pretzel.  Somewhere along the way, 
however, Chan bowed out -- probably as soon as he read the script 
(credited to Mark Feldberg and Mitch Klebanoff).  I don't know the exact 
reason for the action superstar's defection, but, given the final 
product (and it doesn't take a great deal of imagination to guess what 
his role would have been), it was probably a wise career move.  Chan's 
latest effort to hit U.S. shores, FIRST STRIKE, may not be the best 
movie released this month, but it's a significant improvement over this 
lame comedy. </P>
<P>     BEVERLY HILLS NINJA is essentially a one-joke film.  That joke has 
to do with Chris Farley (TOMMY BOY, BLACK SHEEP), who plays one of the 
clumsiest men on Earth, crashing into objects or having things fall on 
his head. There's a reason why cartoons, which often rely on similar 
tactics, are only a few minutes long. The first few times Farley gets 
hammered, there is some amusement value, but, soon after, it grows 
repetitious, then tedious. The movie can't seem to find anything more 
entertaining or original to do than having its star walk into lamp 
posts, crash through glass windows, or smack his head on tree branches.  
Is this what American movie-goers really want to see?  Or is it just 
what Hollywood, which is known for underestimating viewers' 
intelligence, thinks they're looking for? </P>
<P>     As a baby, Haru (Farley) is found by a Ninja clan and raised as one 
of their own.  Initially, they hope he is the "Great White Ninja" whose 
coming is foretold by prophecy, but disappointment arrives when it 
becomes apparent that he can't master the most basic skills necessary to 
be a warrior.  Haru's brother, Gobei (Robin Shou), puts it bluntly:  
"He's fat, he's a fool, and he's an embarrassment to Ninjas everywhere."  
Determined to prove himself, Haru agrees to help Alison Page (Nicollette 
Sheridan), a blond damsel in distress who comes to the Ninjas seeking 
aid.  Mistaking Haru for a master, she asks him to spy on her good-for-
nothing boyfriend (Nathaniel Parker).  Shortly thereafter, she 
disappears, and Haru fears for her safety.  After finding a match book 
that says "Beverly Hills", he decides to go after her, in case she needs 
rescuing.  His adopted father, the venerable Ninja master, Sensei (Soon 
Tek-Oh), sends Gobei to the States as Haru's "shadow."  Once in 
California, Haru makes all the usual "fish out of water" mistakes, none 
of which lead to anything close to the level of humor attained by better 
films with similar ideas, such as CROCODILE DUNDEE. </P>
<P>     It's rather amazing to see how agile Farley is in certain 
situations (he performed some of his own stunts), but his unexpected 
athleticism doesn't make up for the film's lack of entertaining 
material.  BEVERLY HILLS NINJA is even less ambitious than director 
Dennis Dugan's last feature, HAPPY GILMORE.  At least that movie has an 
edge; this one doesn't have anything.  Farley might want to be like John 
Candy, but, while Candy knew how to make an audience laugh, Farley keeps 
missing the mark.  His brand of humor, which doesn't vary significantly 
from film-to-film, isn't just juvenile, it's lackluster and unfunny.  
And, because BEVERLY HILLS NINJA relies so heavily on the comic's 
limited talent, the movie sinks like a rock.  No one, not even Jackie 
Chan with all of his enthralling derring-do, could have saved BEVERLY 
HILLS NINJA from its ignominious fate.   </P>
