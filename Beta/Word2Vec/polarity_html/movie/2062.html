<P>     Orphaned in India, where her transplanted English parents lived
before falling victim to an earthquake, Mary Lennox (Kate Maberly)
comes to the cold, aloof household of her uncle, the widower of her
mother's twin sister.  There she is viewed as nothing short of a
meddlesome nuisance by the housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock (Maggie Smith),
and is ordered to stay in her room until told to come out.  Mary
doesn't obey, of course, and in her explorations discovers the room of
her sickly cousin Colin (Heydon Prowse), from whom she is intentionally
being kept.  Outside, she finds something even more wondrous:  the
secret garden of her late aunt.  With the help of Dickon (Andrew
Knott), a local boy who can talk with animals, Mary sets to work
reclaiming the garden from the weeds and brambles that had overrun it.</P>
<P>     THE SECRET GARDEN has at least two things going for it:
remarkable acting and mesmerizing cinematography (by Roger Deakins).
Even without much of a story, this film could stand alone on those two
qualities.  It's amazing to find a child, especially one as young as
Kate Maberly (who, at the age of ten, has already been in numerous BBC
TV productions), capable of carrying a film.  And Maberly isn't all
sugar-and-spice.  Her Mary has plenty of bitterness, disdain, and
arrogance to make her virtually unbearable at times.</P>
<P>     Maggie Smith, always the consummate professional, is excellent as
the nasty housekeeper.  Mrs. Medlock isn't all bad, however, even
though her few moments of humanity could hardly be called
heartwarming.  Her real motives, while frequently pursued in the most
misguided and warped of methods, are nevertheless good and true.  Her
dislike of Mary comes as much from a perception of the danger that the
young girl could present to Colin Craven as from the sudden injection
of randomness into a previously well-ordered existence.</P>
<P>     THE SECRET GARDEN is based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1911
novel, and director Agnieszka Holland (recently at the helm for EUROPA,
EUROPA and OLIVIER, OLIVIER) has taken care that the screenplay follow
the book.  Ms. Holland is an avowed fan of the story, having read it
over and over again as a child.  The care and effort she poured into
this, her first Hollywood effort, is proof enough of that.  She has
created a picture that is magical for viewers of all ages.</P>
<P>     The story is essentially about the redemption of two damaged
children.  Mary, while hale of body, is an emotional cripple.  She grew
up unloved in a household where her selfish parents handed her off to
the servants.  Colin is neither physically nor emotionally whole.  His
father, never having recovered from the death of his wife, rarely
visits Colin in the sickroom, leaving the boy's care to the implacable
and unaffectionate Mrs. Medlock.</P>
<P>     The secret garden is a place of rare and wondrous beauty, and it
becomes the emotional balm that heals all wounds, both physical and
psychological.  There, Mary learns how to feel and Colin how to walk.
These two form a fast friendship both with each other and with Dickon,
the younger brother of one of Mrs. Medlock's maids.</P>
<P>     THE SECRET GARDEN combines drama, fantasy, and a little bit of
light Gothic horror (the old house with its strange noises) into a
satisfying mix.  The film is a visual feast, from the eerie insides of
Misselthwaite Manor to the time-lapse photography of blooming flowers.
Zbigniew Preisner's score adds to the atmosphere without ever becoming
obvious or intrusive.</P>
<P>     I'm not sure how some younger viewers will react to this film.
Most of them will miss the subtle nuances that Agnieszka Holland brings
to the screen (which are aimed at adults), but the story, centering as
it does around children, will be enough to captivate many.  Obviously,
THE SECRET GARDEN is not an action film, and those weaned on that genre
are likely to find this production stale.  Nevertheless, it is an
excellent family film for those willing to immerse themselves in its
leisurely pace--the picture proceeds just fast enough to keep the
audience's attention while exhibiting a great attention to detail.  THE
SECRET GARDEN has something to offer everyone, and that's a rarity
among movies these days.</P>
