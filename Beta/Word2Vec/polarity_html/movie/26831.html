<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A purely Hollywood hokum story of the lycanthropy legend, but done with
much gusto and fun. The cast is superb, the atmosphere of an English
village with an Alpine background setting and plenty of fog and dense
woods, gives the film an eerie look. The dialogue is spellbinding at
times. The film covers all angles about werewolves, as Curt Siodmak's
original script is so believable that films ever since have used the
nonsense he perpetrated here as the absolute gospel for horror films.</P>
<P>The story begins as the hulking, broad shouldered Larry Talbot (Lon
Chaney, Jr.) returns to his diminuitive father's castle after being away
for 18 years, upon learning of the death of his older brother in a
hunting accident. Sir John Talbot (Claude Raines) eagerly welcomes him
home, telling him that he is now the sole heir of the estate that goes
back five generations, and tells him to get reacquainted with the three
hundred year old castle he will now live in. Larry is not the
intellectual type, he likes to work with his hands, and shows off to his
father the telescope he built. While testing the telescope, he zooms in
on an attractive young blonde woman Gwynn Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers) and
follows her to the antique shop she works in, which is her father's
place. He flirts with her, buys a rare cane with a silver pentagram of a
wolf-star as a top, and invites her for a walk at night to see the newly
arrived gypsy fortune tellers in the woods.</P>
<P>She arrives with her girlfriend Jenny Williams and tells him that she's
engaged to Frank Andrews, the head gamekeeper on his father's estate.
They decide to get their fortune read by the gypsy Bela (Lugosi), who
does Jenny's first, as they leave her there and walk in the woods. Bela
sees a pentagram on the palm of her hand and warns her to get out of the
woods immediately, she's in danger.</P>
<P>Jenny while fleeing in the woods is attacked by a werewolf and is
killed. Larry hearing her screams runs in that direction and beats the
wolf to death with his silver cane, but gets bit in the process. Gwynn
was too far away to see what happened. When back in the castle, his
father, the police chief, Captain Paul Montford (Bellamy), and Dr. Lloyd
(William), question him, and tell him the body found by the slain girl
is not a wolf as he said, but is Bela. Larry tells them that he's not
crazy, that he knows he saw a wolf, but he can't explain why there is no
visible bite mark on him. They tell him to get some rest and don't worry
about it, that he's under strain from his long trip.</P>
<P>Bela's mother Maleva (Ouspenskaya) meets with Larry and tells him that
her son was a werewolf and that now that he's bitten, he is also one,
and that only silver can kill a werewolf. She tells him, "Even a man who
is pure at heart/And says his prayers by night/May become a wolf when
the wolf-bane blooms/And the moon is full and bright." Larry looks at
her in a confused state, he's not one for such intellectual things. She
also gives him a pendant of a wolf-star to wear as protection. When he
asks dad about it, he's told, it's all in your mind, son. He goes on to
say that everyone has a good and evil potential within them, but
sometimes the evil takes over and comes in the form of an animal.</P>
<P>Larry sees his legs become hairy and he can't help himself as he turns
into a werewolf and kills the local gravedigger. His transformation to
wolf man took a full 24 hours to film-and is convincing, mainly because
of the cosmetic efforts of Jack P. Pierce.</P>
<P>The town under the police chief organizes a manhunt for the killer,
thinking it to be an ordinary wolf. Larry again turns into werewolf and
gets caught in one of the traps, but escapes with the help of Maleva.</P>
<P>At the castle, he tells dad about it and wants to flee the village. He
is especially upset because when visiting Gwynn he saw the sign of the
pentagram on her palm and gave her the pendant for protection. His dad
says he can't flee and defile the good family name. So he straps his son
in a bolted room and goes out at night with the men hunting the wolf,
but not before Larry insists he take the silver cane.</P>
<P>While hunting the wolf, the men hear the screams of Gwynn being attacked
by the werewolf, and Sir John comes to her rescue, beating the werewolf
to death with the silver cane. When the rest of the hunting party comes,
they see Larry lying dead and that Gwynn is alright. Captain Montford
then says, Larry must have tried to save Gwynn from the wolf.</P>
<P>"TheWolf Man" is some kind of special B-movie, it works so well, even if
the story is impossible to believe, because of the stellar cast and that
there is a modern link between the wolfish desires of the Lon Chaney
character and how society can't help itself today in the same
psychologically wolfish way as the wolf man was trapped in. The film had
an undeniable special quality about it that imbued it with a lasting
magic. This one's a classic, one of the greats in the horror genre.</P>
