<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Stage Fright is a hardly frightening but, nonetheless, laudable movie,
that features Hitchcock's droll humor and his perfection in regards to
set arrangements. This is a mystery tale that is not too difficult to
figure out who the guilty party is, but the fun comes in playing along
with the man on the run theme and to follow along with his love stricken
wannabe actress maiden heroine and her eccentric family, and take-in the
Mae West-like performance from the incomparable Marlene Dietrich, as
Charlotte Inwood, a stage actress/chanteuse with a rather vulgar
personality and an odd sense of humor, who rules the London stage world
as if she were a pampered peacock with fangs. This film is more of a
romantic comedy than a suspense film, though there is an element of
grave danger that comes about in the final scene for the heroine.</P>
<P>I simply loved the film, even though I was not crazy about the choice of
Jane Wyman as Eve Gill, the perky heroine who falls in love anew upon
hearing a beautiful piano rendition played by the lead investigator in
the murder case, as she turns her heart over to him from the murder
suspect she was originally pining for. She is acceptable in this
damsel-in-distress role, but doesn't really sparkle in the role and make
you feel for her, perhaps, like a Grace Kelly would have.</P>
<P>This film, the second one Hitchcock has done in England since his return
there from America, is one of the master's most subtle and sharpest
comic efforts. It investigates the deceptions people use to hide the
truth about themselves, as lying is taken a step further onto the stage
of ordinary life and made into an art form, by all the characters except
for the detective and the heroine's slightly off kilter mother. Stage
Fright is sandwiched in between Hitcock's "Under Capricorn" and
"Strangers on a Train", and is equal to if not better than both.</P>
<P>Hitch starts out with the panicky Jonathan Cooper (Todd) telling his
only friend in the world, Eve Gill (Wyman), who is hurriedly driving him
to a hideout because she loves and trusts him, as he tells her how he
has been implicated in a murder. He tells her that the husband of
Charlotte Inwood was just murdered and he has been framed by Charlotte.
In a flashback, the story is related from Jonathan's point of view, as
he tells Eve how Charlotte and he were lovers and that she came to his
flat with blood on her dress, asking him as a favor to return to her
flat and get her another dress so that she can get to the stage on time
to appear in the hit show she's in. In the trick flashback (Hitch is
playing games with the audience on this one), we see Jonathan being
spotted by the housekeeper, a rather dour individual called Nellie Goode
(Kay), as he is running from Charlotte's place with a dress under his
arm. That is why Jonathan tells Eve he needs her help to escape from the
police, and she responds by taking him to see her father, the Commodore
(Sims), who couldn't be funnier in his role as the droll father,
separated from his wife (Sybil), and living on his boat, romanticizing
that he is a smuggler.</P>
<P>Anxious to help her boyfriend out, whom she believes is innocent, she
befriends the handsome young detective assigned to the case, Wilfred
Smith (Wilding), when she follows him into a pub after seeing him leave
Charlotte's flat. Smith falls for her and drives her home, making a tea
date with her for tomorrow at her mother's place. She next connives
Nellie with some money, to say that she is her cousin and will send her
as a replacement maid and dresser to Charlotte for a few days because of
her illness. While being Charlotte's dresser, she is convinced she will
exonerate her boyfriend by getting some information on the actress. What
she learns, is that Charlotte's real boyfriend is her stage manager
Freddie Williams (MacGregor), and that Charlotte could care less that
her husband is dead. She only seems glad that her musical show is even a
bigger hit than before because of all the murder story publicity.</P>
<P>Eve, who is a student with RADA (Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts) and an
aspiring actress, gets the detective to take her to a charity garden
party to support the arts, which RADA is throwing, where she hopes to
get the detective to see he is on the wrong track chasing Jonathan when
it is Charlotte who is the murderer. In one classical scene, her father,
in his bid to help, even as he sees she is switching lovers right in
front of his nose and doubts if her old boyfriend is innocent; he,
nevertheless, comes up with a plan to have a cub scout go up to the
stage where Charlotte is singing and show her a doll whose dress is
smeared with blood. This puts a fright into Charlotte.</P>
<P>Eve will then blackmail Charlotte when they are back in the theater,
getting her to offer to buy the blood-smeared dress back from her at a
ridiculously high price, while the police listen in on the conversation.
This works but the only trouble is, that Eve is the last one in the film
to find out that her boyfriend really is guilty and, as a result, she is
trapped alone with him in the theater as the police hunt him down.</P>
<P>This is certainly not Hitchcock's best work, it is not suspenseful
enough for that, after all, the master of suspense should live up to his
reputation. But, the film is very diverting and artfully done, and
Dietrich was never better. Watching her performance alone, was enough
for me to love this Hitchcock work, even though it is merely a minor one
in his opus.</P>
