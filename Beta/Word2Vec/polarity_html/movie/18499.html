<P>     There are few central dramatic conflicts trickier to pull off -- or
more potentially annoying -- than a mid-life crisis.  The protagonist can
easyily become unsympathetic, his introspection little more than
self-indulgence.  It's rare to find a character with the potential to turn
a family man's grass-is-always-greener musings into something compelling,
but that's exactly what we find in Chris Lloyd (Christian Bale), the
central figure in METROLAND.  What a shame that potential isn't remotely
realized.  METROLAND is a character study with huge chunks of context
missing, a surface-level gloss on the clash between youthful idealism and
adult responsibility.</P>
<P>     The story opens in 1977, where advertising man Chris is living with
his wife Marion (Emily Watson) and infant daughter in the London suburb of
Eastwood, a bedroom community dubbed "Metroland" for its dependence on
rail commuters.  Chris feels a vague discontent with his domestic life, a
discontent that becomes more palpable with a visit from his childhood
friend Toni (Lee Ross).  An itinerant would-be writer still living free
and easy, Toni inspires Chris to reflect on the path that led to his own
domesticity.  In flashback we see Chris first as a rebellious teen in
1963, then as an aspiring photographer living in Paris five years later.
There he has a sexual affair with a French woman named Annick (Elsa
Zylberstein), an affair that haunts him with thoughts of a life that might
have been</P>
<P>     Plenty of things about Chris are intriguing conceptually.  As a
youth, and again as an adult, he is convinced by Toni that life in this
"bourgeois" world is pathetic, a shabby substitute for a life of art and
random affairs.  What Chris finds hard to accept is that Metroland is
actually the world he prefers.  He drifts from Annick to Marion because he
feels disconnected from the life he craves, then he drifts from Marion
because he thinks he has sold out the bold dreams of his youth, even
though he was never entirely committed to them.  As mid-life crisis
material goes, this is pretty unique stuff:  a man who strays not so much
because he's unhappy with what he has, but because he figures he's
_supposed_ to be unhappy.</P>
<P>     Don't make the mistake of assuming director Philip Saville and
screenwriter Adrian Hodges will flesh out those ideas.  For all its
flashing back, METROLAND never portrays Chris interacting with his family
as a youth to provide background for his feelings about suburbia.  It
never spends enough time developing the friendship with Toni that will
color Chris' entire life.  It never explores Toni's character in any
depth, relying on third-party psychoanalysis to explain his motivations.
There's a consistent superficiality to METROLAND, a refusal to give the
characters a depth that makes plot developments -- like a late revelation
regarding Marion -- feel anything but arbitrary and exploitative.</P>
<P>     There's some nice atmosphere to METROLAND, particularly from Mark
Knopfler's silky score and an effective period look, but it doesn't come
close to making up for the narrative shortcomings.  It doesn't help that
Seville uses inefficient techniques like cross-cutting with 1977 Chris'
pondering face throughout the 1968 flashbacks, or that Christian Bale's
performance is most notable for his perpetual petulant pout.  It's a film
in which the only clarity comes from its most obvious observations. 
METROLAND is a missed opportunity to give thematic weight to a mid-life
crisis, leaving yet another story of a horny husband trying to be 21
again.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 rail passes:  4.</PRE>
