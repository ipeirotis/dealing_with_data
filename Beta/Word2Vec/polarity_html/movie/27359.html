A HARD DAY'S NIGHT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Watching A HARD DAY'S NIGHT from 1964, now in re-release in the theaters 
with a newly restored print and sound, is rather like watching an old 
newsreel.  Were we really like that? Did 60s rock really ever have that 
child-like innocence as embodied in the four lads from Liverpool? </P>
<P>Of course, the answers are: we were, and it did.  But gosh, it now seems 
more like a million years ago rather than just a little over a third of 
a century.  </P>
<P>The Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo 
Starr), undoubtedly the best rock group ever, had a popularity then that 
hasn't been rivaled since.  The movie, done in a mock day-in-the-life 
documentary style, shows pre-teen and teenage girls swooning and 
screaming with such intensity that they make themselves sick.  In 
real-life many such fans passed out and had to be carried out on 
stretchers.  The movie, while minimizing the Beatle hype, concentrates 
on the sheer joy of their music.  Whenever they are singing in the 
movie, which is often, the picture soars.  The producers had the now 
radical idea of actually including entire songs, not just choppy 
excerpts, in the film.  Too bad that this technique has long since 
vanished.</P>
<P>Less successful than the musical numbers are the silly little 
non-musical episodes including ones of the boys hamming it up together.  
A major subplot concerns Paul's freeloading, obstreperous grandfather, 
played by Wilfrid Brambell with beady eyes, round glasses and a long, 
thin face.  Put a pair of antlers on him, and he'd be a dead ringer for 
Bullwinkle.  Besides trading off of the family name, the grandfather 
tries to cash in on the boy's fame by selling photos of them with forged 
signatures.</P>
<P>Even though these four working-class blokes charm us with their natural 
playfulness, the reason to see A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is as the best music 
video ever.  Sit back and soak up the songs.  Don't even try to keep a 
smile off of your face and a song out of your heart while watching the 
film.  It's just not possible.  </P>
<P>A HARD DAY'S NIGHT runs just 1:27.  The film is in a handsome black and 
white, which enhances its documentary feel.  It is rated G and would be 
acceptable for all ages.  </P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, who is 'N Sync kind of guy, thought the movie 
was pretty good, giving it ** 1/2.  He liked the songs the best and 
thought the other parts of the movie were dumb but sometimes funny.</P>
