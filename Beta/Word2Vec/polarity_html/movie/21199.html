(Mrs. Emery), Marc Michel (Roland Cassard), Ellen Farner (Madeleine),
Mireille Perrey (Aunt Elise), 1964-Fr.)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The film critic, Jonathan Rosenbaum, has written a great review on the
merits of Jacques Demy and his film, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, going
on to compare Demy to the great Japanese film director, Yasujiro Ozu.
The similarities between the works of these two is, indeed, striking,
since they both made films devoted to the normalcy of the family
structure, keen on preserving the daily traditional rituals of each of
their cultures; while curiously enough, both men were deviant of their
culture's sexual mores. Demy being married to the director Agnes Varda,
was nevertheless considered to be bi-sexual, dying of AIDS in 1990.
While Ozu, a bachelor, was thought to be gay. That both men achieved
excellent success in their films by portraying the human condition
through the eyes of normal lifestyles is, indeed, a curious oddity.</P>
<P>Umbrellas is made into an opera-like film by composer Michel Legrand.
The actors sing their lines rather than just say them. The film itself
is lushly colored in pastels, offering a very brilliant
color-coordinated production. It tells the story of two young lovers in
Cherbourg, in 1957; the 17-year-old salesgirl in her mother's umbrella
shop, Genevieve (Deneuve); and, the 20-year-old garage mechanic Guy
(Nino). They plan to get married, but the war in Algeria changes their
plans when to Guy's dismay he receives a draft notice.</P>
<P>Genevieve's mother, Mrs. Emery (Anne), every inch of her body is
bourgeois, objects to the marriage because she is too young to know what
love is. When her business assumes great debts, she goes with her
attractive daughter to try and sell her jewels but is rebuffed by the
jeweler; but, a rich young man in the store at the time comes to the
rescue by buying the jewels from her. He tells her he is a diamond
merchant and will not lose money. It turns out that this is Roland
Cassard (Marc), the rejected suitor from Demy's first feature film,
Lola. He is the one who couldn't stay at home when Lola spurned him;
and, thereby, went traveling to find himself, in the process of finding
himself he becomes extremely wealthy. The mother is impressed with
Roland's good manners and kindness, and feels he would be a protective
husband for her daughter.</P>
<P>The last date Guy and Genevieve have before he goes into the army, turns
out to be significant; it is the first time they sleep together. As a
result, she becomes pregnant, which she keeps secret. Their departure at
the railroad station is full of promises of marriage, being true to each
other, and their love being forever. But Guy turns out to be a poor
letter writer and Genevieve is disappointed in not hearing from him for
long stretches of a time. He probably doesn't write her because he
develops a limp when hit by a handgrenade and doesn't want to worry her.
But Genevieve's mother pushes her to Roland, taking advantage of her
confused state; and he proposes, willing to take the child as his own.
And so she marries the one she doesn't love... Roland is not aware of
this marriage until he comes home from the war in 1959.</P>
<P>He becomes bitter and has trouble adjusting to civilian life, after a
squabble with his boss at the garage, he decides to quit his mechanic's
job and live off his army pension from his wound. When his godmother,
Aunt Elise (Mireille) dies, she leaves him enough money so he can buy
his own gas station. On the rebound, he asks the sweet girl, Madeleine
(Ellen), who devotedly took care of his sick aunt, to marry him, even
though he doesn't love her.</P>
<P>It is now 1963: Guy and Madeleine have a son. It is snowing and they are
happily decorating their Christmas tree in his Esso station. As soon as
Madeleine and her son go out for a walk, a Mercedes pulls in with
Genevieve and her daughter. He is startled to see her.This is the first
time they have met since he went into the army. They talk inside his
office, exchanging banalities, but not saying what is on their mind. He
doesn't know that he has a daughter, and refuses Genevieve's offer to
meet her little girl. She never tells him about why she married, or of
his daughter. She drives back to Paris when Guy says, "I think you'd
better go."...  Guy's wife soon returns and he starts playing with his
kid.</P>
<P>Their class differences were well-mapped out in the final scene: he has
moved up the ladder to  middle-class prosperity. She has become
upper-class. Their lack of communication is now complete. He has never
met her husband, and does not realize that it was her husband's Mercedes
that he serviced on the day we first see him happily rushing off to date
Genevieve.</P>
<P>This story doesn't seem to be much on paper, but it is as poignant, as
surely as it is ordinary. It is one that happens most of the time,
rather than the reverse being true, of people marrying for love. And
that is Demy's point, that coincidences, luck, and good timing seem to
matter even more than love.</P>
<P>Everything about this film was done to perfection. Demy is one of the
most underrated directors of French cinema. American audiences rarely
get a chance to see his great body of films, and that is surely their
loss.</P>
