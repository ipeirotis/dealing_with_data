<P>Director Luis Mandoki's last film was the superb, serious 1994 drama 
"When a Man Loves a Woman," but his luck has ultimately run out with his 
latest picture, "Message in a Bottle," which is the worst type of 
romance, a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the 
heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather 
than tear them up. Everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in 
advance since this same type of story has been done many times 
before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense, and the 
film ultimately moves at such a very, very deliberate pace, as if it is 
trying to make great, "meaningful" statements and plot developments, 
that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through. </P>
<P>"Message in a Bottle" begins with Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright Penn), a 
single mother and researcher at the Chicago Tribune, whom finds a bottle 
washed up on shore as she is jogging one day. Inside the bottle is an 
anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named Catherine, and 
Theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it 
around at her work and, to her objection, finds that her editor has 
placed the letter in the newspaper. Soon, a heavy research is conducted 
to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship 
logo on the top of the typed message, and after it is traced to a man 
named Garrett Blake, Theresa finds herself traveling to the Outer Banks, 
a boating town in North Carolina, to find out the specifics of the 
message. Of course, Garrett turns out to be a handsome, rugged man 
around Theresa's age and played by Kevin Costner. She is immediately 
charmed by him, but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there, 
and finds that Catherine was Garrett's late wife who died a few years 
earlier. Do you think you know where this is headed? Most likely you do, 
and I wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's 
end, the movie has fallen into deep, artificial melodrama that I didn't 
buy for a second.</P>
<P>If there are any positive things to say about "Message in a Bottle," it 
is that the performances by Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman, as 
Garrett's stubborn, but loving father, are far above par to be in such a 
wasteful, "Shaggy Dog" love story, and that the cinematography by Caleb 
Deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast, and 
paints Chicago as an equally alluring city. Meanwhile, Costner has yet 
to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has 
made recently. It seems that with such bad luck, he wouldn't want to 
make another movie set near water, but here he is again with one of the 
main, and most ridiculous, centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea. The 
other actors are all, sadly, wasted, including Illeana Douglas, an 
underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the "friend" roles, 
here playing Penn's confidante and co-worker at the Tribune.</P>
<P>The first half of "Message in a Bottle" plays like a hum-drum, trite 
television movie for the Lifetime channel, as Theresa spends a great 
deal of time "getting to know" Garrett, with dialogue that is not the 
least bit stimulating or entertaining. Usually, I am the type of person 
to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is 
no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships, but 
here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt 
"written," and not as if people were really "talking." When the main 
characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other, 
and are not particularly interesting themselves, you know immediately 
that you are in trouble. </P>
<P>I swear that while watching "Message in a Bottle," I felt as if I had 
just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater 
(heck, in actuality I'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on, 
by Nicholas Sparks). Always one step ahead of the characters, the movie 
ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true 
Hollywood melodrama, the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger 
of tearing. Nobody wins prizes for guessing that Garrett will eventually 
find out Theresa's secret, and that several obstacles will come within 
their ways of living happily ever after. This same exact problem 
occurred in last year's very, very similar (watch this, and you will 
realize just how similar I mean) Meg Ryan-Nicolas Cage romantic drama, 
"City of Angels."</P>
<P>Although Theresa is deeply touched by the "heartfelt" letter that she 
finds in the bottle, perhaps the filmakers might have been better off 
finding a message in a bottle of their own, preferably before filming 
began. It should have read, "Memo to screenwriters: Use you brain!"</P>
