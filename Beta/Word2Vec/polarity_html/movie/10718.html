<PRE>Hoodlum</PRE>
<PRE>Summary </PRE>
<P>    Set in Harlem during the Great Depression, rival gangster "families" go to
war over control of "The Numbers", an illegal gambling lottery.  "Runners" take
bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for
drawings.
    The undisputed leader of the Harlem numbers is the Madame Queen (Cicely
Tyson) who is challenged by Dutch Schulz (Tim Roth), a ruthless hoodlum. By
turning against the Queen, Dutch defies his partner, the infamous Lucky Luciano
(Andy Garcia), who wishes to respect the Queen and keep the peace.
    The Queens' army strengthens when an acquaintance, Ellsworth "Bumpy"
Johnson
(Lawrence Fishburne) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her.
He
proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt (on
himself and the Queen), and later takes control of the Queens army when she is
jailed for tax evasion. Bumpy's reign is not as restrained and subdued as the
Queen and he declares all out war on Dutch. Bloody gang warfare ensues.
    Bumpy faces many obstacles during his reign. His new army questions his
methods. His girlfriend (Vanessa L. Williams) and the Queen disagree with his
violent solutions. Most importantly (in his eyes), Dutch has become a more
formidable foe than he imagined, and seeks help from Lucky Luciano to
assassinate him. </P>
<PRE>Commentary</PRE>
<P>    There have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be
hard to write an original story dealing with it. This movie is not original at
all. In fact, I was angered by how many similarities there was between this
film
and, arguably, the best gangster movie of all time, The Godfather. If you are
going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit, why not borrow
from a lesser known movie (say, Millers Crossing?). How could the credited
screenwriter Chris Brancato not give credit to Mario Puzo himself? Here are
just
some of the major similarities (I stopped counting at 10).</P>
<P>Crooked Cop assaults blood relative of the leader.
Gang extracts revenge on crooked cop.
Wife (or girlfriend) questions her partners' murderous activities and leaves
him.
High ranking "officer" betrays the leader.
Blood relative of the leader murdered.
War erupting between the "families".
High-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family
members.
New leader runs family differently from previous leader.
Large meeting with all families involved.</P>
<P>    The setup in this movie is done rather well. I enjoyed the portrayal of the
network of "runners" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the
Queens lottery. This was the way of life in Harlem, and most people involved
with the Queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and
put food on the table. Number running was the only way for the Harlem
population
to find work. I also enjoyed the interaction between the angry, violent Dutch
and the calm, patient Lucky.
    After about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the
Godfather
start appearing, one after the other (and in short order). It was a huge
distraction, and an insult to my intelligence. Who was the screenwriter kidding
here? 
    Some of the individual performances were well done. Andy Garcia was very
convincing as Lucky, unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting
role. Tim Roth effectively plays the cocky villain, much like his roles in "The
Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover" and "Rob Roy". The good performances
and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the
lackluster story that follows. A couple of coincidences is one thing, over a
dozen is an insult.</P>
