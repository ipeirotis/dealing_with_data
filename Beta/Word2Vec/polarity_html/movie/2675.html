<PRE>                            THREE COLORS: WHITE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Zbigniew Zamachowski, Julie Delpy, Janusz Gajos.
Screenplay:  Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz.
Director:  Krzysztof Kieslowski.</P>
<P>     Give this to Krzysztof Kieslowski: he's been busy and he hasn't
been repeating himself.  It is understandable that he announced his
retirement from filmmaking at this year's Cannes Film Festival where
RED, the third segment of his THREE COLORS trilogy, premiered; three
films in two years is enough to burn anyone out.  Still, it is a shame
to see such a versatile director leave the scene.  Last year's BLUE was
a marvelous psychological drama; WHITE is an acidic little comedy.
WHITE is also somewhat less satisfying than BLUE, well-acted and
directed but suffering from basic deficiencies in motivation and
characterization.</P>
<P>     WHITE tells the story of Karol Karol (Zbigniew Zamachowski), a
meek Polish hairdresser living in Paris with his beautiful new wife
Dominique (Julie Delpy).  As the film opens, Dominique is suing Karol
for divorce, on the grounds that he has been unable to consummate their
marriage.  His bank accounts frozen and thrown out on the street, Karol
finds himself reduced to panhandling on the Metro.  There he meets
Mikolaj (Janusz Gajos), a kindly but depressive bridge player who helps
Karol return to Poland.  Once back in his homeland, Karol sets out to
change his life.  Through complicated wheeling and dealing, Karol puts
himself in a position of power, from which he will be able to even the
score with Dominique.</P>
<P>     Kieslowski does a superb job from the outset of establishing that
Karol is a man who is, both literally and figuratively, on the
receiving end of life's excrement.  Humiliated, broke and cuckolded
(over the phone, no less, in a scene both hysterical and sad), Karol is
a perfect stand-in for anyone who has felt positively overwhelmed by
life.  Zbigniew Zamachowski gives a delightful physical performance as
the rumpled but sympathetic Karol, appearing perpetually bewildered and
on the verge of tears.  However, he is less successful at conveying
Karol's transformation into a slick go-getter.  Like many events in
WHITE, the change occurs too quickly, and it seems to be presented as
an article of faith that this is something that was always within
Karol, just requiring the right setting--at least I didn't see it on
the screen.</P>
<P>     Even more perplexing is Dominique, whose feelings for Karol are
believably convoluted but who turns into a bizarre creation by the
film's conclusion.  There is a surreal quality to the events of WHITE's
last fifteen minutes, a quality which sabotages any sense of
character.  The sequence which theoretically explains this change
(featuring an effective use of an all-white screen as an accent)
doesn't, at least not as believably as it should.  Julie Delpy, like
Zamachowski, nails her character in the beginning of the film, but
drifts into something unrecognizable by the final scene.</P>
<P>     It's unfortunate that the characters are so unfocused, because
Kieslowski's exploration of equality is intriguingly multi-faceted.
Most obviously, there is Karol's attempt to "get even" with Dominique,
an attempt with unexpectedly successful results.  However, there is
also an examination of post-Communist economics in Poland, and how
Karol builds from his luck two-franc piece into a wealthy
entrepreneur.  As Karol's brother notes, "This is Europe now," as Karol
finds he can indeed buy anything.  Money serves both as a tool of
equality and inequality, allowing Kieslowski to question the benefits
of the new world order.  WHITE is full of interesting ideas, more than
ten average films put together, but they're just not executed all that
smoothly.  Moments of brilliance shine out in WHITE; others are dulled
by chaotic characterizations.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 shades of white:  6.</PRE>
