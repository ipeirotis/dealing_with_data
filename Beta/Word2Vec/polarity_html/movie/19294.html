<P>     It's easy enough to adopt the head-shaking perspective that the
Muppets just ain't what they used to be.  Certainly the death of Jim
Henson left a void in the Muppet universe, but it's only fitting that the
show has gone on.  "The Muppet Show's" setting as an old-time vaudeville
revue wasn't just a goofy conceit; it exemplified the whole Muppet
philosophy.  Sure, the scattershot jokes and variety numbers could be
groaners, but they were delivered with such a pure desire to please that
it almost didn't matter.  The Muppets were -- and continue to be --
entertainment from a bygone era, where you rarely had to target kids
exclusively because virtually all entertainment was "family
entertainment."</P>
<P>     MUPPETS FROM SPACE is a broad, silly, fairly charming piece of Muppet
capering based on a 20-year-old running gag:  exactly what is Gonzo (Dave
Goelz) anyway?  Stepping away from their recent literary adaptations, the
Muppets are cast as themselves, living together in one big house.  Though
they appear to be a happy felt-headed family, Gonzo still feels isolated
by his singularity.  A possible answer comes to him in the form of a
message from his alphabet breakfast cereal, leading Gonzo to the
conclusion that he is a refugee from an alien race.  This development
grabs the attention of government operative K. Edgard Singer (Jeffrey
Tambor), who intends to use Gonzo as proof of his theory that we are not
alone.</P>
<P>     The premise sets up jokes targeted at just about every "aliens among
us" movie of the last 25 years.  A woman shows up with a mashed potato
sculpture of Gonzo a la CLOSE ENCOUNTERS; the Muppets encounter some
star-cameo Men in Black, including "SportsNight's" Josh Charles and
wrestler Hollywood Hulk Hogan; a scene at a laboratory window recalls
INDEPENDENCE DAY.  There's even a swing into the unexpected territory of
THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, as imprisoned rat Rizzo (Steve Whitmire) escapes
through a hole hidden behind a "Mice Girls" poster.  Sly pop culture
references and slapstick carry most of the humor, but there's also the
simple pleasure of the company of familiar characters.  When Kermit,
Fozzie and Miss Piggy lead a mission to rescue Gonzo, the history of those
characters somehow makes every simple joke that much funnier.</P>
<P>     It's also true that MUPPETS FROM SPACE has an inconsistent tone and 
a higher-than-usual ratio of duds to chuckles.  Several cameo appearances
fall flat, including David Arquette as a crazed scientist and F. Murray
Abraham as a dream-sequence Noah.  The use of a musical score full of 70s
soul classics like "Brick House" and "Celebration" feels forced, since the
Muppets are anything but funky.  And as hard as the post-Henson Muppet
gang has worked to make Gonzo the new protagonist, he just doesn't have
the warmth and appeal of Kermit, who's now relegated to a sort of elder
statesman role.  MUPPETS FROM SPACE can keep you smiling, but it rarely
hits the high points of classic anarchic Muppet wit.</P>
<P>     Still, there's enough subtly subversive humor in MUPPETS FROM SPACE
-- as well as enough wild sight gags -- to make you glad the Muppets are
still around.  The film's best, most cultural crusader-unfriendly joke
finds Gonzo admitting to his pals that "I guess I've always had alien
tendencies...this just seems natural to me."  Those who have fretted for
years that Bert and Ernie were actually lovers may furrow their brows at
such alternative lifestyle innuendo, but it's a perfect nod to the kind of
unconventional family the Muppets have always been.  Then again, that's
the kind of bond theater people often form, and the Muppets are nothing if
not true theater people.  Okay, not _people_ exactly...just entertainers
who remind you that it's a good thing for the show to go on.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 E. T. foam homes:  6.</PRE>
