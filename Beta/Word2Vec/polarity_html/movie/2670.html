<PRE>                                THE LION KING
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Voices:  Matthew Broderick, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Jeremy Irons,
         Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkinson, James Earl Jones.
Screenplay:  Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton.
Directors:  Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff.</P>
<P>     There is a yin to every yang, and if there is a down side to the
remarkable success of Disney's recent animated features, it's that the
Mouse keeps upping the ante for every subsequent feature.  1989's THE
LITTLE MERMAID became the highest grossing animated release ever, as
did 1991's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and 1992's ALADDIN.  Is THE LION KING
ready to follow in those massive footsteps?  Most likely.  While not as
emotional as BEAUTY or as fast-paced as ALADDIN, THE LION KING is
genuinely entertaining, with moments of truly stunning visual
creativity.  Only weakness in the music and a fractured tone hamper the
proceedings.</P>
<P>     THE LION KING is the tale of Simba (voice of Jonathan Taylor
Thomas), the son of Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones).  The birth of
the new heir displaces the king's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons), leading
the envious Scar to plot the death of Mufasa and Simba.  When Mufasa is
killed while trying to save Simba, Scar convinces Simba he must go into
exile.  There Simba is befriended by meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane) and
warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), and grows to adulthood (adult voice of
Matthew Broderick) blissfully free of responsibilities.  However, when
childhood friend Nala (Moira Kelly) informs Simba that Scar is
destroying the prideland, Simba must decide whether to keep his
distance or to confront his demons ... and Scar.</P>
<P>     Like the last three big Disney hits, THE LION KING is a musical,
but it probably shouldn't have been.  Elton John and ALADDIN lyricist
Tim Rice have provided five new songs, but nothing has the sparkle of
the Menken/Ashman compositions, and for the most part the production
numbers seem more obligatory than inspired.  "I Just Can't Wait to Be
King" is a silly, gaudy bit, and "Hakuna Matata" is a recycled "Bare
Necessities."  The one exception is Scar's song, "Be Prepared," which
Irons delivers with zest.  It also features a chilling sequence with
goose-stepping hyenas parading past Scar against a subtle background
with images of swastikas.  Hans Zimmer's Afro-tinged arrangements and
incidental score make the most of the music, but THE LION KING is much
more effective when the story is spoken rather than sung.</P>
<P>     The story is a somber one, an animated "Hamlet" of sorts, and
frequently the animation matches that tone.  The elephant graveyard,
populated by Scar's hyena cohorts (voices by Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech
Marin), is a spooky wonder, while the later appearance of Pride Rock is
simply bleak.  These sequences might be less than entrancing to the
very young, but they are offset by lively, funny sequences featuring
Timon and Pumbaa.  Nathan Lane gives Timon a Bugs Bunny cockiness which
is charming, and Ernie Sabella is equally endearing as the affably
flatulent warthog.  Nala's pursuit of Pumbaa is the film's comic
highlight, but the action in THE LION KING tends to be more serious.
Parents should exercise some judgment regarding taking children under
six.</P>
<P>     None of this is to suggest that THE LION KING plods along
humorlessly.  Timon and Pumbaa get the most to work with, but they are
ably assisted by the other supporting characters.  Scar, while
sinister, gets of some dark one-liners; Robert Guillaume has a small
but goofy bit as a Yoda-like baboon.  The most entertaining vocal
performance, however, comes from Rowan Atkinson (the malapropping
minister from FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL).  As Zasu, a hornbill who
serves as Mufasa's chancellor and Simba's chaperone, he gets a fussy
part that's a cross between THE LITTLE MERMAID's Sebastian and BEAUTY
AND THE BEAST's Cogsworth, but Atkinson's droll delivery makes it his
own (and provides the single biggest laugh with a shot at one of
Disney's most annoying songs).  THE LION KING is not a masterpiece; it
is too slow at times, and has perhaps too many characters to juggle.
Still, it is witty and beautifully drawn, and is sure to continue
Disney's amazing animated winning streak.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 lions:  7.</PRE>
