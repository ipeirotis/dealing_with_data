<P>     SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW (say it three times fast and sound like an 
asp) opens with a breathtaking image:  great cliffs of gray-blue ice 
towering over a vast plain of white.  Once the opening credits have 
concluded, we suddenly find ourselves adrift in a special effects-
enhanced prologue set in 1859 Greenland.  And, while this sequence seems 
completely disconnected with the movie that follows, it is a visually 
pleasing way to introduce a contemporary mystery that incorporates 
murder, greed, and science fiction into an often uneven, occasionally 
preposterous, but always engrossing whole.</P>
<P>     Based on the novel by Peter Hoeg, SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is truly 
an international production.  The cast is comprised primarily of British 
and American screen luminaries; the director, Bille August, is a Dane; 
and the film's funding comes from Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and the 
United States.  Although the action transpires entirely in Copenhagen 
and Greenland, the dialogue is exclusively in English, with nary a 
subtitle to be found. </P>
<P>     Julia Ormond (SABRINA) plays Smilla Jaspersen, a half-Inuit 
mathematician who currently resides in Denmark.  One day, upon returning 
to her apartment, she discovers that Isaiah (Clipper Miano), the child 
who lives on the floor below her, has fallen to his death.  The 
authorities say the fall from the roof was an accident, but, citing 
certain irregularities about the incident, Smilla claims it was murder.  
Another resident of the building (Gabriel Byrne) agrees with her.  When 
the local police stonewall her, Smilla begins investigating on her own, 
and, the deeper she gets, the more dangerous the situation becomes.  Her 
inquiries lead directly to the powerful and wealthy Dr. Tork (Richard 
Harris), the head of Greenland Mining, who is behind a cover-up that 
includes, among other things, a host of prehistoric worms (I am not 
making this up).</P>
<P>     As thrillers go, SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is definitely 
unconventional.  The locations are atypical, the protagonist is a woman 
who doesn't run into the arms of a man at the first sign of trouble, and 
there aren't any car chases.  The storyline is reasonably complex (not 
to mention a little silly) and features enough small surprises and 
twists to retain the average viewer's attention.  And, the fact that 
it's a "why-dunnit" or "how-dunnit," rather than a "who-dunnit," allows 
us to focus on more interesting issues than identifying possible red 
herrings.  As crisply directed by Bille August (PELLE THE CONQUEROR), 
SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW moves rapidly -- almost too rapidly.  The plot 
clicks along so briskly that numerous character details get lost in the 
rush.</P>
<P>     Smilla, as forcefully portrayed by Ormond, is a fascinating 
character, but many of the more interesting aspects of her personality 
are relegated to the background.  She's sullen, lonely, and angry, and, 
while a brief flashback or two attempt to explain why she is the way she 
is, they only hint at the reasons for her deep-rooted bitterness.  In 
fact, there were times when I actually became annoyed at the film for 
pursuing the plot with single-minded determination rather than taking a 
few moments to delve more deeply into the main character.  Smilla is 
presented with enough detail to tantalize, but not enough to satisfy.  
In the end, we're left wishing the movie had spent a little more time 
filling in a few more blanks.  </P>
<P>     Aside from Ormond, whose turn as Smilla is both effective and 
attention-grabbing, and Richard Harris, who brings a world-weary 
cynicism to his part, the acting is surprisingly lackluster.  Vanessa 
Redgrave is unremarkable in a cameo as a retired secretary with a key to 
secrets, and Robert Loggia, as Smilla's father, is a little too 
restrained (the actor always seems at his best when chewing on scenery).  
Most disappointing of all, however, is Gabriel Byrne, who seems ill-
suited for his role as Smilla's sidekick.  He's supposed to be 
enigmatic, but the actor's one-note performance makes him lifeless.</P>
<P>     The film's climax will probably seem preposterous for anyone 
expecting SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW to stay grounded in reality.  If 
nothing else, the opening sequence should prepare you to accept that 
boundaries not normally crossed in murder mysteries will be broken.  
SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is not a landmark thriller, nor is it likely to 
appeal to those who demand a semblance of reality.  But it is involving 
and entertaining, and features an intriguing, independent heroine.  
Those things alone make it worth a trip to a nearby theater.</P>
