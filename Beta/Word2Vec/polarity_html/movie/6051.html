<PRE>                               FLY AWAY HOME
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Fantasies that the whole family can enjoy are few and far between.
Studios executives generally look for kids' shows with minimum
intelligence and maximum slapstick humor.  The result is that these
films are either major silly in an attempt to play down to the little
tykes or they are full of gross bathroom humor thinking that is the
only type that will keep the attention of the teens and subteens.  FLY
AWAY HOME proves them wrong.  It is a delight for all ages, and miracle
of miracles, it does this without any crude jokes or anything
offensive.</P>
<P>     The story opens in New Zealand where a car crash leaves 14 year
old Amy Alden (Anna Paquin) without a mother.  She goes to live in
Ontario, Canada with her Dad, Thomas (Jeff Daniels).  He is an inventor
and sculptor whose chief passion is building and flying ultralight
planes and gliders.  Amy has not seen him in ages.  He rationalizes
that New Zealand is far away, to which she grumbles, "That's a lame
excuse."  So far the show is nothing more than your formulaic
despondent adolescent flick.</P>
<P>     The fantasy kicks in when loggers come and cut down the trees
nearby where Canadian geese are nesting.  Amy finds about 15 eggs left
by the scared mother geese.  She takes them to her room and creates an
incubator out of nothing more than a blanket, a chest, and a portable
light.  One of the attractions of the show for parents is it provides
good role models for their children.  Amy is inventive, dedicated, and
compassionate.  In a perfect metaphor, Amy comes out of her shell when
the cute little geese come out of theirs, and she discovers that her
dad is a great resource and her biggest supporter.</P>
<P>     Jeff Daniels is one of my favorite lessor known actors.  From his
recent 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY to his best performance ever in GETTYSBURG,
he adds something special to the roles he plays.  Here his relentless
approach is both exhausting and inspiring to watch.</P>
<P>     Anna Paquin (THE PIANO and JANE EYRE), who is a dead ringer for a
Welsh girl named Lizzie that Jeffrey met on vacation this summer in
Denmark, is charm personified.  Her every motion is graceful, and when
she is one with the geese, it becomes hard not to cry for reasons
having to do with nothing more than the love of life that she radiates.</P>
<P>     Also visiting and sometime living in Tom's house is his girlfriend
Susan Barnes (Dana Delany) and his sort of daffy brother David (Terry
Kinney).  On meeting Amy, David greets her with, "You must be Amy.  I
gave you Silly Putty once for Christmas.  You ate it."</P>
<P>     Besides the fantasy aspect there are two compelling reasons to see
the show.  One is the inventiveness previously mentioned, but the most
enchanting is the rapport between Amy and her geese.  She becomes their
mother, and a better mother or more loyal children could not be
imagined.</P>
<P>     The tension in the story is that the geese must migrate in two
months or they will die, and without adult geese to show them the way,
they will not know how to get there or ever get back.  Soon a plan is
hatched whereby they built an ultralight plane that can fly at the slow
speed of the geese and can direct them to a preserve in North Carolina.
Amy ends up flying the plane.  The show then is about the geese growing
up while Amy prepares for and then flies the big flight.</P>
<P>     You will soon lose count of the many precious scenes in the
picture, but let me cover a few lovely ones that brought me joy and
mirth.  When they are young, Amy has the geese on a cloth on the
kitchen table where they demonstrate their lack of litter box training.
Tom shakes his head about what he has gotten himself into.</P>
<P>     The scenes of the geese waddling behind Amy had the entire
audience smiling and was mentioned as a favorite by the kids that
accompanied us to the picture.  The most breathtaking scene and the one
most likely to engender tears was the sheer majesty of the scene where
Amy's minions follow her on her first big flight.</P>
<P>     The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel (THE NATURAL, THE RIGHT
STUFF, and THE BLACK STALLION) is the key underpinning to the film's
success.  He has a genius for knowing just how to form a visual.  When
filming the egg breaking he alternates between sharp close-up work on
the eggs to a wide-angle look at Amy's face as it glows in awe of the
new, little life forms.  In FLY AWAY HOME he uses a lot of shadow work
to accentuate the warm browns and earth tones of his color palette.
His aerial shots are certainly the most spectacular.  That crazy little
plane with the geese flying behind filmed against the clouds and the
sunset is a marvelous sight to behold.</P>
<P>     The villain is provided effectively by the local wildlife agent.
Since the geese are the "property of the crown," he tries to clip their
wings.  In this show, his fingernail clippers were as effective as the
weapon in THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  Amy steps in and saves her
geese, but the villain will return.</P>
<P>     Taken as a fantasy, the film makes perfect sense.  Don't ruin it
for yourself by over analyzing it.  When they finish the plane that
will make the journey, Uncle Dave says, "With this baby you could fly
over the Empire State Building."  Less confident Tom concludes, "or end
up as a big pound of ground round.  One of the two."  This was my son's
favorite line.  Only Susan is concerned with reality so she warns Tom,
"Broken promises are the worst.  Better not to promise anything."</P>
<P>     Director Carroll Ballard (THE BLACK STALLION and NEVER CRY WOLF)
has an imaginative and deft touch.  Why Ballard has only made five
films in seventeen years is a mystery to me.  The fine script was
written by Robert Rodat and Vince McKewin, and is based on the
autobiography by Bill Lishman.</P>
<P>     I do have two quibbles with the movie.  First, why do we have the
scene where the Uncle gives Amy a nose ring which she then wears for
the rest of the picture.  This would get her kicked out of school in
most school districts, and she is the only person in the film with such
body jewelry.  If this was a film about generation Xers, I would
understand, but this little fourteen year old is the epitome of
sweetness and innocence.  The nose ring is just out of character.</P>
<P>     Second, why did we need the cliched subplot where the
environmentalists are shown confronting evil capitalists, or is that an
oxymoron in movies, who are raping nature.  Rather than just have her
racing to get the geese to the preserve before winter, we have her
getting there before a developer bulldozes down the land to build
houses.  We have a guy putting his body in front of the bulldozer while
waiting for Amy's plane to arrive.  Kids' movies uniformly show
environment issues as totally one sided.  That these kids live in
houses made of lumber, drive cars powered by gasoline, and generally do
lots of things where environmental tradeoffs are made every day is
never discussed.  Just mention the word environment and you have
trumped any possible argument.</P>
<P>     FLY AWAY HOME runs 1:47.  It is rated PG for three mild cuss words
and a very subtlety handled car crash.  There is no sex, nudity, or
violence.  The film would be fine for kids of absolutely any age, but
should delight adults as well.  We took Jeffrey (age 7) and his
neighborhood friends Jessica (age 7) and George (age 5) to see the
picture.  They all loved it with Jeffrey giving it six thumbs up.
Never were they scared, and they were entranced with it from beginning
to end.  I loved the show and think you will too so I recommend it and
give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
