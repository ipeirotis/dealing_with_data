<P>     Like PATRIOT GAMES and THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER before it, CLEAR
AND PRESENT DANGER takes liberties with its source material.  Whether
this is "good" or not will be left to Clancy-o-philes to mull over.
With all the hype attendant to it, however, this particular Jack Ryan
adventure is somewhat disappointing.  Beneath its posturing as a
"techno-thriller", CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is really little more than
a high-class blast-and-bang festival.  It's SNIPER with more plot, a
better cast, and an hour of extra running time.</P>
<P>     CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is all plot and no characters.  The
people running around on screen have about as much depth as the sheen
of sweat on Harrison Ford's forehead.  Jack Ryan is the most
disappointing of all.  He's disgustingly virtuous: a flawless fighter
for good and justice, a Superman without the cape.  I spent half the
movie wondering if this guy was ever going to show anything to mark him
as vaguely human.</P>
<P>     The story is exceptionally, and often needlessly, convoluted.
This comes as a result of attempting to retain some of the flavor of a
long, complex novel.  More attention is demanded of the audience than
is probably necessary for this sort of movie.  A little lapse of
vigilance is all that's necessary to lose your way, yet the ultimate
payoff doesn't seem worth it for those who manage to navigate the
film's labyrinthine twists.</P>
<P>     A massacre on board a boat in the South Caribbean starts in motion
the wheels of vengeance in Washington.  One of the victims could claim
a friendship with the President of the United States in addition to his
connections to the South American Cali drug cartel, from whom he had
stolen more than $600 million.  So, under the command of the battle-
hardened Clark (Willem Dafoe), an elite team of soldiers is sent into
Columbia to assassinate the drug lord responsible for the shipboard
slaughter.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, Admiral Greer (James Earl Jones), the Deputy Director
of the CIA, is diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer.  Unable to
continue his job, he asks Jack Ryan (Ford) to take over for him.  Ryan
does so, only to end up in the middle of a high-level coverup.
>From Washington to Columbia and back again, Ryan attempts to disinter
the truth while certain nervous factions of the government seek to have
him killed or, failing that, set up as a fall guy.</P>
<P>     Some of the technical elements of CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER are
fascinating (principally because the movie actually gets a lot of this
stuff right), and there are several well-executed action scenes (even
if Harrison Ford is getting a little old to be getting involved in so
many fist fights).  There's also a moment of cinematic flare where the
proceedings of a normal funeral are intercut with those of a very
untraditional - and bloody - one.</P>
<P>     As can be seen in CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, there's only so much a
performer can do with a sketchily-written role.  With parts of minimal
importance and limited visibility, Anne Archer and James Earl Jones are
vastly underused.  Harrison Ford, the man with top billing, is steady
(as usual), but unexceptional.  There will be no "best acting"
nominations from this film.</P>
<P>     CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER boasts excellent sound - too bad the
pedestrian visuals aren't of equal quality.  In a time when good
special effects are the standard, the viewer has a right to expect more
from a picture of this magnitude than a cheesy-looking smart missile.</P>
<P>     At least there's more complexity evident here than in THE PELICAN
BRIEF, the straightforward John Grisham thriller that dealt less
effectively with high-up Washington corruption.  Nevertheless, whether
because of or in spite of CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER's involved plot, too
many corners are cut.  The uneven flow is as likely to lead to a
snoozing viewer as to one on the edge of their seat.  CLEAR AND PRESENT
DANGER is enjoyable, but it's a shallow enjoyment that doesn't leave me
hungering for Paramount Pictures' next Clancy adaptation.</P>
