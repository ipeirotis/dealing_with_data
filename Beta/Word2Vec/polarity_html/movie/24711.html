<PRE>URBAN LEGEND (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: F</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Jamie Blanks</PRE>
<PRE>Screenplay: Silvio Horta</PRE>
<P>Starring: Jared Leto, Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Joshua Jackson, Robert
Englund, Tara Reid, Michael Rosenbaum, Brad Dourif, Natasha Gregson Wagner</P>
<P>The great actor James Woods once said (and I'm paraphrasing), "If sex isn't
messy, then you're not doing it right". A truly profound statement, and one
that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre (just replace "sex" with
"your mad slasher film"). For those uninformed souls, the mad slasher genre (or
sub-genre) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service
of a plot that follows an identical outline: a usually masked but always crazed
killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la HALLOWEEN.</P>
<P>URBAN LEGEND is a mad slasher flick, but one that is so sanitary, bloodless,
and nudity free, that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful (though not
overly talented) cast, it more closely resembles an overlong WB television
special. For film makers, gore is one of the two weapons they have at their
disposal in a stale, fright-free horror movie, as Stephen King once said (again
paraphrasing) "If you can't scare your audience, gross em' out, if you can't do
that, make em' laugh". Alas, URBAN LEGEND succeeds only at the latter, though
not by intention. I actually find the fact that this film became a minor
success ($40 million domestic box office gross) more frightening than anything
in it. It seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree
that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt. The
promotion for URBAN LEGEND sure promised thrills, but how can anyone with a
three digit IQ argue that it provides them. Unfortunately, these kinds of
flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations;
one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized
audiences to the point where films don't need to do anything more than promise
a good time without the added pressure of delivering. If anyone disagrees I
would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like BATMAN AND
ROBIN, WILD WILD WEST, and GODZILLA.</P>
<P>But forget all that, it goes without saying that Mad Slasher films (or any
other exploitation off-shoot) will be made without an ounce of craft
(especially considering the sheer volume that are produced). Allow me to
present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film: the lack of
enthusiastic exploitation. These flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty
aspirations, so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time?
Sadly out of the literally hundreds made, I would estimate that maybe three are
at all worth while. And URBAN LEGEND would certainly not be included amongst
those three. Despite its considerable production value and the absence of any
boom mics slipping into frame, it is just as awful as any no budget entry in
the slasher sweepstakes.</P>
<P>As far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation URBAN LEGEND's
setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities: It takes place on a
college campus, which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed
killer. You see, the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young
people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the
surface. All those young people are growing up together, going through all
kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows, so naturally some weirdness is
expected. All the better for that elusive crazed killer. Coupled with the
copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around, and the introduction of
a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task.
But alas, URBAN LEGEND is not only idiotic and cliché full; it's way too
clean, a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity, little gore, and
much stupidity. This is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims
from the scene of the crime for no reason other than, I dunno, exercise. It's
the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey,
yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing
techniques. It's the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as
a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack. I really wish filmmakers would
just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing. Yes the audience jumps,
momentarily frightened, but wouldn't anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly
infiltrated a quiet room.</P>
<P>I lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in URBAN LEGEND about
ten minutes in when I caught a glimpse of the killer. Apparently filmmakers are
running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers. In SCREAM it was a
ghost mask (scary enough), in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER it was a fisher
man's rain slicker (in the middle of summer no less), and in URBAN LEGEND the
disguise sinks to the level of Mel Brooks parody: the villain wears an
oversized parka with a fury hood (ooh…scary) intended to conceal his/her
identity. For URBAN LEGEND 2 I humbly suggest a Donald Duck costume.</P>
<P>Though I must admit, URBAN LEGEND does have a winning premise for what could
have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film. The film's killer slices
and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends (you
know, like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that
they're coming from inside the house). I won't spoil the surprise as to what
urban legends are used, after all the film does offer fine 2:00 am cable
viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough. Sad to say, it doesn't include
my favorite urban legend: A fairly graphic antidote concerning Richard Gere and
a very unhappy gerbil. Now that would be scary.</P>
<P>Before I leave you, I would like to bring to your attention the third most
irritating thing about the film (the first being the lack of craft, the second
the lack of exploitation)-- its characters, all of whom are just about the most
annoying group of people I've ever spent an evening with. Only Jared Leto
(looking like a carbon copy of Rob Lowe from back in the day) and Alicia Witt,
as the resilient heroine, avoid vexatiousness. The most annoying of the bunch
is a tie between Noxima girl Rebecca Gayheart and sitcom star Michael
Rosenbaum, as a supremely irritating lout (so irritating I actually cheered his
painful death, and I am not a cruel person). Ironically those aggravating sacks
of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film; if viewed as a
vicarious fantasy URBAN LEGEND can be mildly entertaining. After all this is a
movie that features the kind of faux hipsters I can't stand getting
slaughtered, which is at least better than watching an entire film about people
I can't stand not getting slaughtered.</P>
