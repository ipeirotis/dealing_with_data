<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>How can a bad film be good? Well, in the hands of  Edgar G. Ulmer, it is
possible to end a film with an overbearing melodramatic paranoia to it,
on the edgy words of the protagonist, who wonders to himself how, "fate
could put the finger on you and me for no good reason at all," and not
be laughed at as pretentious dialogue. Instead, this work becomes a
memorable cult film that can so easily in lesser hands than the skilled
Ulmer, have fallen into the realm of inanity, but here becomes a strong
film about the meaning of fate. What is most amazing, though, is that
this film was shot in six days in a Poverty Row studio on an extremely
low budget, without an attempt to get any location shots for a story
that centers around a cross-country hitchhiking trip, and yet it remains
gritty and realistic even if the film is full of technical errors. It
remains fully a part of the rich history of
B&W noir films. It is also an example of what the big studios can't seem
to do well, how in their attempt to make a film that is pleasing to a
large market share of the audience, they too often lose track of how
interesting a story can be without the usual formula applied to it or
the need for making it glitzy, and they fail to get into the soul of
their stars, where they should have been going in the first place. Which
might explain how this poorly acted, weakly-crafted story, was so much
applauded by film buffs that it has reached classical cult status in
film lore and is even revered by certain noted directors such as Martin
Scorsese, and was held-up by the French movie critics as a work of true
art when they discovered the neglected film in 1950.</P>
<P>Al Roberts (Tom Neal) is a piano player in New York City who is in love
with the singer, Sue (Claudia Drake), in the dive-like club he plays at.
But she is ambitious and breaks off their marriage, telling him that she
is going to Los Angeles to try to make it to the big-time. Despondent,
he phones her after she is there for quite awhile and learns that she is
working as a waitress. He tells her that even if he's broke, he will
still hitch out there to be with her.</P>
<P>The film opens with him hitching a ride to a Reno diner, telling people
at the counter that he wants to go east. The story is told in flashback,
as the grousing hitch-hiker hears the song 'I Can't Believe You Fell in
Love With Me,' played on the jukebox, and we find out what happened to
him to make him so desperate and resigned to losing all hope. In a
voiceover, he asks, "Did you ever want to forget anything and can't
because there is always something that comes up to remind you of what
you were trying to forget?"</P>
<P>His bad luck in getting rides seems to change when a fancy convertible
stops to pick him up in Arizona and the driver, Charles Haskell, Jr.
(Edmund MacDonald), an affable bookie, tells him that he's in luck,
because he's heading to Santa Anita racetrack.</P>
<P>After Haskell treats him to a meal, and they are on the road, it starts
to rain, and when Al tries to awaken him to help him pull down the
convertible top, he is surprised to find that Haskell has died from a
heart attack. The most memorable part of the film, the part that seemed
the eeriest and most convincing comes next, as Al starts to panic and
can't think clearly. He goes over in his mind the choices he has, as he
keeps saying to himself who would believe me if I told them what
happened: 1) My first instinct tells me to run. 2) The next possibility
is to sit tight and wait for the cops.</P>
<P>Al decides to hide the body and take off with the car and Haskell's
wallet and driver's license. Unfortunately when he tries to get him out
of the car, Haskell's head hits a rock, making Al more certain that he
made the right decision to run away.</P>
<P>Seemingly home-free, entering California, he picks up a woman
hitch-hiker, the femme fatale, Vera (Ann Savage), and she turns out to
be the hitch-hiker that Haskell told him about, the one who badly
scratched him up after he tried to make a pass at her. Vera is a truly
rotten person and holds him prisoner in her attempt to make a killing on
this fortuitous turn events for her. She threatens Al that she will go
to the police unless he gives her all of Haskell's money, which he does
without a fight. But when she insists they go into Los Angeles and sell
the car, he stalls, just wanting to get away from her.</P>
<P>Haskell had told them both the same sad story, about running away from
home at 15 after putting a friend's eye out in a duel with his dad's
Franco-Prussian sabers. While trying to sell the car in Los Angeles,
Vera reads that Haskell's rich father is dying, and schemes for Al to
impersonate the long-lost son and inherit the estate. While waiting for
the old man to die, they sit in a dinghy hotel room and argue, until the
drunken Vera goes in the other room to call the police after he refuses
to go along with the scheme, and Al accidently kills her when he pulls
on the telephone cord not seeing that it was wrapped around her neck.</P>
<P>His destination is now on a detour, as he decides he can't see Sue like
he is, and turns back to the diner in Nevada, where he is hitching a
ride in the rain back east, feeling only bad things can happen to him,
and as luck would have it, he is picked up by the police in the film's
closing shot.</P>
<P>Al has made his case to the audience, and like a true noir protagonist,
life has kicked him where he is most vulnerable. His weak character and
not his criminal act of stealing Haskell's identity are the cause of his
downfall. His struggle against fate, is doomed from the start of his
journey. His doom when rejected by the girl he loved cannot be
overturned. What makes the film inevitably pessimistic, is the mixture
of passion and foolishness that follow the hero wherever he goes, as he
sees before him how the left and right coast hold the same dim promise
for his future; that the road is dark even when it is sunny.</P>
<P>Since fiction is not necessarily stranger than life, this nightmarish
tale echoes what happened to Tom Neal in real life, as he would serve
six years in prison for killing his wife.</P>
<P>Ulmer has created an unusually bleak character study, that plays like a
mesmerizing confession, as the hero has the intangible quality of
innocence going for him, which adds a seductive quality to his character
for those in the audience, such as me, who can appreciate his natural
inclination not to trust the authorities, even when that seems to be the
most rational thing to do in the dire predicament he was in. For some,
being outside the system, is as natural as walking in the fog. To
understand that, is to begin to understand the power of a noir film,
probably the most original cinematic work the American film industry has
produced. The noir hero is just not like the other Hollywood heroes; he
does not see the world in technicolor.</P>
