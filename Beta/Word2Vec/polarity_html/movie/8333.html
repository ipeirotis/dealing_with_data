<P>     "Harrison Ford is the President of the United States" trumpet the
print ads for AIR FORCE ONE, to which the only appropriate response is:
well, of _course_ he is.  The phenomenally popular presidency of Ronald
Reagan, if nothing else, gave us a solid sense of what the American people
really want in a Chief Executive.  They want a cross between John Wayne
and Bill Cosby, someone who can be both America's Sheriff and America's
Father Figure.  In short, they want an approachable ass-kicker.</P>
<P>     If that phrase doesn't describe Harrison Ford among all A-list
Hollywood stars, I don't know whom it does describe.  Ford's James
Marshall, the President imperilled in AIR FORCE ONE when terrorists hijack
the First Plane, is the President every American secretly dreams about --
a resolute leader and devoted family man who also happens to be handy with
an Uzi.  Not only would we follow him into battle (and make no mistake, he
_would_ be leading the charge), we'd play a game of touch football with
him on the lawn afterwards.</P>
<P>     That kind of man isn't just the perfect President -- he's also the
perfect action hero.  AIR FORCE ONE is an extraordinarily effective
thriller by any standard, but it's even better with Ford on board.
Wolfgang Petersen's direction combines the claustrophobia of DAS BOOT with
the cat-and-mouse dynamic of IN THE LINE OF FIRE, then throws in a few
stomach-churning dogfights and mid-air escape attempts just for seasoning.
There hasn't been a more assured piece of technical film-making in
theaters this year, nor a more riveting action spectacle.  Ford, however,
moves AIR FORCE ONE from the realm of the mere thrill ride to something
more potent.  He gives you the sense that something is at stake:  honor,
family, the life of a real human being in danger who is also the President
of the United States.</P>
<P>     It is the "honor" part of that equation which may raise a few hackles
over the rah-rah patriot games of AIR FORCE ONE.  There is a decidedly
retro-80s feel to the Communist zealots led by Gary Oldman, to the TOP
GUN-style military hot-doggery, to Ford's Rambo-in-pinstripes solo
guerrilla campaign to free hostages.  Still, Andrew W. Marlowe's script
never feels jingo all the way.  Oldman's performance gives weight to lines
which might sound like token imperialist-bashing in someone else's mouth
(one such line finds him quieting a righteous hostage by screaming "You
killed 100,000 Iraqis so you could save a nickel a gallon on gas...don't
lecture me on the articles of war").  In fact, every performer takes
chances which make AIR FORCE ONE more than a simple crowd-pleaser.  The
gutsiest choices may be those made by Glenn Close, playing Vice-President
Kathryn Bennett.  In a more pandering film, Bennett would have been the
take-charge woman in a room full of ineffectual men.  Instead, Close plays
her as smart but uncertain, dedicated to her President perhaps against all
reason.</P>
<P>     Not that anyone could blame her.  Part of what makes AIR FORCE ONE so
satisfying -- and, at times, so wryly amusing -- is that it places
President Marshall squarely in the real world of 1990s American political 
consciousness.  The unswerving devotion, the candlelight vigils and the
tremendous popularity all make perfect sense as the reactions of cynics in
the presence of true greatness.  It's easy to get caught up in the thrills
of AIR FORCE ONE, not just because it is so well-constructed, but because
we're watching a national fantasy.  There's only one thing missing from
the finale of AIR FORCE ONE:  Harrison Ford should step onto the tarmac at
Dulles, tip his hat to the assembled throng, sweep the First Lady up onto 
his trusty horse, and ride into the sunset.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 hails to the chief:  9.</PRE>
