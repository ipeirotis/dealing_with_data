<PRE>                                  THE MASK
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, Peter Riegert, Peter Greene,
Richard Jeni, Amy Yasbeck.
Screenplay:  Mike Werb.
Director:  Charles Russell.</P>
<P>     Either you "get" Jim Carrey, or you don't.  All right, maybe
there's a little middle ground, but not much.  Carrey is turning into
one of those performers who inspires as much head-shaking among his
detractors as laughter among his fans.  Apparently my Carrey Threshhold
is higher than that of most critics; I enjoyed his ACE VENTURA shtick
while all about me were hurling brickbats.  Now he gets to carry a big
budget summer fx comedy, THE MASK.  And once again, his manic gifts
turn a wafer-thin story into a real guilty pleasure.  As lively as the
special effects are, THE MASK would be a loud dud without Jim Carrey's
unique talents.</P>
<P>     Carrey stars as Stanley Ipkiss, a milquetoast bank clerk who
frequently finds himself on the receiving end of life's splashed
puddles.  One evening after his car breaks down, Stanley finds a
strange mask floating in the ocean.  When he puts the mask on, he
becomes a superhuman whirling dervish, seemingly able to make his every
whim a reality, including winning the attentions of beautiful night
club singer Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz).  However, The Mask also draws
the attention of Tina's shady boyfriend Dorian (Peter Greene) when he
interferes in a bank heist Dorian is orchestrating, and of a stoic
police detective (Peter Riegert) for the same reason.  Much to his own
amazement, Stanley becomes a real superhero, fighting crime to save the
day.</P>
<P>     If the underlying premise of THE MASK seems familiar--mild-
mannered guy is affected by supernatural forces and finds his innermost
desires released--it's because it was already done this summer in
WOLF, right down to the detail of how the same phenomenon has a
different effect on people with different "true natures." WOLF handled
the theme much better, but it was a more stylish film in many ways.
THE MASK is full of cookie-cutter small-time hoods better suited for
comic relief than for any real villainy, which makes Stanley's
predicament much less interesting.  In fact, it's probably safe to say
that nothing in THE MASK would be at all interesting without its
inventive visuals and Jim Carrey's rubbery mug.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, THE MASK does have those elements, and they make for
a dizzying ride.  The computer graphics which turn Carrey into a
walking Tex Avery cartoon are delightful, granting him a lunatic
arsenal of tricks.  The most whimsical use of ILM magic might be the
Mask's effect on another cast member, Stanley's scene-stealing dog
Milo, in a hilarious bit from the final showdown.  Special kudos also
should go to the makeup team headed by Greg Cannom, which has managed
the challenging task of making Carrey's Mask distinctly otherworldly
without obscuring his malleable features.  With so much technical
wizardry flying around, it might be easy to overlook the art direction
and set decoration, from Stanley's apartment to the Coco Bongo Club,
all of which are perfectly in tune with the comic book atmosphere of
THE MASK.  All these elements are skillfully combined by director
Charles Russell (who was "Chuck" Russell when directing low-budget pics
like A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3).</P>
<P>     Then there is 1994's boy wonder, Jim Carrey, who turns in a
performance so energetic it should probably be regulated.  He goes
Robin Williams' ALADDIN Genie one better, using his own face and body
as often as any cinematic chicanery to become a gallery of characters.
He is the single best reason to see THE MASK, and he truly must be seen
to be believed.  Surprisingly, he actually gets supporting help,
particularly from Peter Riegert, effectively deadpan as the no-nonsense
cop.  There are flat spots, like the sluggish performance of Richard
Jeni as Stanley's friend and co-worker, and the aforementioned
yawn-inducing villains.  The bottom line is this:  if you can
appreciate the idea of a group of police officers involuntarily joining
The Mask in a performance of "Cuban Pete, and if Carrey doesn't make
you cringe, THE MASK will fit you perfectly.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 masks:  7.</PRE>
