<P>     LA PROMESSE, a rare import from Belgium, indicates how grim the 
mood of a film can become when there's almost no comic relief.  
Excepting one or two moments of gallows humor, there's little to break 
the relentlessly bleak tone.  Fortunately, the script is written with 
such intelligence and the characters are developed so believably that, 
irrespective of the downbeat approach (or, perhaps, because of it), it's 
difficult not to be moved by the plight of 15-year old Igor (an unforced 
performance by newcomer Jeremie Renier), who is trapped into choosing 
between his father, Roger (Olivier Gourmet), and the demands of his 
conscience.</P>
<P>     When the film opens, Igor is already wise beyond his years.  He's 
an active participant in his father's shady, "immigration service" 
business.  Roger is one of those crooks who makes his money by preying 
on the desperation of others.  For exorbitant fees, he smuggles illegal 
immigrants into Belgium, forges false work permits for them, and sets 
them up in slum-like apartments (for which he charges unreasonably high 
rents).  Many of the immigrants also work at Roger's construction site, 
where they are paid a pittance for hard, occasionally-dangerous work.  
Igor, who also works as an apprentice at a garage, serves as his 
father's assistant, and has learned to lie, cheat, and steal just as 
well as his old man.  </P>
<P>     In addition to being a criminal, Roger is also a bully.  When his 
son does something to displease him, he beats him mercilessly.  Despite 
all that, there's little doubt that he loves Igor, although he's unable 
to express his affection effectively.  In addition, he has trained 
himself to objectify the men and women he smuggles into the country, 
adopting the same basic philosophy as the Belgian police:  "Illegals 
don't exist."  To Roger, the immigrants are a less-than-human source of 
income, and that is a philosophy he attempts to pass on.  (This reminded 
me of a subplot in John Singleton's ROSEWOOD in which a father taught 
racism to his son.)  Dad's lessons are leaving an impression upon Igor 
until an event occurs that forces him to re-evaluate what he has 
learned.</P>
<P>     One of Roger's workers, Amidou (Rasmane Ouedraogo), falls from a 
scaffold and is critically injured.  As he lies dying, he extracts a 
promise from Igor to care for his wife, Assita (played with quiet 
dignity by Assita Ouedraogo), and infant boy, both newly arrived from 
Bugina Faso.  Rather than taking Amidou to a hospital (where all sorts 
of difficult questions would arise), Roger elects to let the man bleed 
to death, then buries him under a thick layer of cement.  He encourages 
Igor to forget the incident, but the boy cannot, and his attempts to 
honor his promise to the dying Amidou generate friction between himself 
and his father.  Worse still, Assita is often a grudging, if not openly 
unwilling, recipient of Igor's aid.</P>
<P>     Essentially, LA PROMESSE is a variation of that motion picture 
staple, the "coming of age" story.  The difference here, however, is 
that the choices faced by Igor are more complex than is the norm.  
Becoming an adult does not mean, as his father asserts, learning how to 
drive and "getting laid" -- it means assessing the value of his word and 
heeding the call of his conscience, regardless of the price.  No matter 
what Igor does, he will betray someone -- the crux of the matter for him 
is determining which betrayal he can live with.  Although LA PROMESSE 
presents a resolution, it makes it clear that there are no easy answers 
for Igor or for us.  </P>
<P>     As directed by brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (who have been 
making documentaries in their native country for more than two decades), 
LA PROMESSE has a "you are there" style that favors a cinema verite 
approach to polished photography.  In concert with a quartet of natural 
performances and a persuasive, insightful script, this method results in 
a film that one could easily accept as non-fiction.  Indeed, while this 
particular story is an invention of the writer/directors, a host of 
universal truths can be found just beneath the surface.</P>
<P>     LA PROMESSE is designed to challenge an audience.  There are 
numerous instances throughout when viewers will find themselves 
wondering what they would do in similar circumstances.  On each of these 
occasions, the directors proceed in a logical, intelligent manner, and 
rarely stray into melodrama (although there are a few minor slips here 
and there).  Despite being a low-key production, LA PROMESSE speaks 
volumes about how we treat other human beings and what it means to truly 
grow up.</P>
