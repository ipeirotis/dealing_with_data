<P>     THE TRIGGER EFFECT, a psychological thriller from David Koepp, 
opens with an image of coyotes tearing at a dead carcass.  An electrical 
power plant stands in the background.  It's a visceral, unsettling 
scene, and you'd have to be more than a little dense not to figure out 
that it's a metaphor.  Like THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, THE TRIGGER EFFECT 
wants to explore the fine line that divides the civilized man from the 
inner beast.  And, while this film admittedly has its share of problems, 
it at least does a better job of achieving that goal than this year's 
adaptation of the H.G. Wells story.</P>
<P>     To the extent that THE TRIGGER EFFECT is intended as a tense, 
somewhat nerve-wracking thriller, it's adequate, and certainly better 
than the formula-driven likes of THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE.  First-
time director Koepp, working with tips from Steven Spielberg and Brian 
De Palma (Koepp co-wrote JURASSIC PARK and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, and was 
able to call on the directors of those films for advice), handles the 
material smoothly.  The flaws lie mainly in the script that writer Koepp 
gave himself to direct.</P>
<P>     The premise is as intriguing as it is timely:  what if some freak 
occurrence caused a massive, perhaps country-wide, blackout?  There's no 
electricity, telephones don't work, and no TV or radio stations are on 
the air.  No one understands what's happening.  The authorities don't 
have answers.  With communications out, law and order is breaking down.  
Looters are being shot on sight.  People are buying guns to protect 
their property and families.  The specter of anarchy looms.</P>
<P>     Our guides through this nightmarish vision are a typical yuppie 
couple, Matt (Kyle MacLachlan) and Annie (Elisabeth Shue).  The cracks 
in their apparently-happy marriage begin showing not long after the 
lights go out, and the arrival of their longtime friend, Joe (Dermot 
Mulroney), hastens the erosion.  Joe and Matt are supposed to be good 
buddies, but a current of hostility bubbles just beneath the surface of 
their relationship, and the volatility of their situation threatens to 
bring it violently into the open.  The danger is further increased when 
Matt pawns his watch to buy a 12 gauge shotgun.  Meanwhile, a mysterious 
black man named Raymond (Richard T. Jones) keeps having odd, chance 
encounters with Matt.</P>
<P>     THE TRIGGER EFFECT's most serious problem is that, while the 
tension is palpable, the setup generating it feels contrived.  Once we 
settle into Koepp's plot, the story is solid enough to keep our 
interest, but it's difficult to plow through all the artificiality that 
burdens the film's early scenes.  The characters seem like creations of 
the moment; we have no sense of their history, and we certainly don't 
like them -- they're irritating and self-centered.  It's as if they 
didn't exist before first appearing on screen.  Too much of the 
interpersonal strife between Matt, Annie, and Joe seems manufactured, 
and, since it doesn't feel natural, it damages our ability to accept the 
trio as human beings rather than products of a writer's imagination.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, THE TRIGGER EFFECT is about how people react when 
driven by desperation, and, to a lesser extent, how humanity has come to 
rely too heavily on technology.  There are times when these themes are 
hammered home a little too zealously, but, unlike in THE ISLAND OF DR. 
MOREAU, we're spared a sermon.  Heavy-handed symbolism and obvious 
metaphors are as far as THE TRIGGER EFFECT goes.</P>
<P>     Once Koepp has brought us through the awkward setup, things improve 
dramatically.  There are a number of compelling sequences, including one 
where the three main characters, fleeing their California home for 
Colorado, encounter an armed stranger (HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL 
KILLER's Michael Rooker) alongside a deserted highway.  The series of 
events started by this meeting force Matt to question his own capacity 
for violence, and whether there can be any such thing as mutual trust in 
a chaotic world.</P>
<P>     At times, Koepp's vision is almost post-apocalyptic, which gives 
the film a dark, paranoid edge.  The reason for the blackout is never 
explained, which is probably a good thing -- the film works better with 
the cause left as a matter of conjecture.  Had Koepp fashioned better-
rounded characters with a more believable central conflict, THE TRIGGER 
EFFECT could have been an outstanding example of high-energy, thought-
provoking cinema.  However, as it is, it's more intriguing than 
memorable, and worthwhile only to those with the patience to sit through 
a dissatisfying and uneven first half-hour.</P>
