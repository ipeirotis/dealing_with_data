A SIMPLE PLAN (1998)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Sam Raimi</PRE>
<P>Writer: Scott B. Smith (based on his novel)</P>
<P>Starring: Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Bridget Fonda, Brent Briscoe, 
Chelcie Ross, Becky Ann Baker, Jack Walsh, Gary Cole</P>
<P>It's been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller, 
where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the 
characters, but it's been even longer since I saw a thriller that 
actually *shock* cared for the characters, not merely judged them but 
actually allowed their human foibles, flaws, and strengths to emerge so 
radiantly. I'd saw that it's been at least a couple decades, even as far 
back to the great Hitchcock thrillers, though I'm hardly comparing "A 
Simple Plan" to, say, "Rear Window" or "Strangers on a Train." Yet it's 
almost as good. It's simple, yet strangely complex, and astonishingly 
rewarding, because instead of moving from plot point to plot point, and 
merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones, it instead concerns 
itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its 
protagonists can go to, all without ever judging them as either evil or 
even immoral. Elegantly directed by Sam Raimi (yes, the same), "A Simple 
Plan" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a 
bag full of millions of dollars by an upright, moderately financially 
stable working man (Bill Paxton), his dim-witted brother (Billy Bob 
Thornton), and his drinking buddy (Brent Briscoe). Without anyone 
around, and the possibility that no one would come looking for it, the 
three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes, they 
will keep it, but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash 
come looking, and so they generally don't flaunt anything they don't 
want to flaunt, they'll keep it stored away in the custody of Paxton.</P>
<P>The possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse: a) they could 
endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities; b) they could try to 
fight off the rightful owners, who are either villainous or just; or c) 
they could fight amongst themselves. "A Simple Plan," though borrows a 
little from each of these. A little tiff with the cops here, a subplot 
involving an alleged FBI agent (a chilling Gary Cole) there), and a bit 
of inside feuding over here. But, as Austin Powers would say, that's not 
necessarily its bag (baby). What I most admired about this film, and 
what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it's 
successfully able to have its cake and eat it too. It effectively 
involves some of the traditional thriller cliches, like the ones 
mentioned above, but at the same time, it involves itself more deeply 
with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they 
have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag.</P>
<P>So while steps are taken to neatly cover things up, and these subsequent 
steps go miserably awry, the film choses to never loose the sight that 
in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to, they 
are slowly losing their souls and their humanity. In one early scene, 
Paxton and Thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some 
of the money so it doesn't look like it was all stolen (not a bad idea), 
when Thornton screws up (as he does continuously throughout the movie), 
and Paxton has to do some major covering-up (read: homicide). Instead of 
a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing, Raimi shows a lengthy, 
painful shot from a low-angle onto Paxton's face as he tries to sift 
through his emotions and reach a conclusion. There's a similar shot 
afterwards of Paxton watching the murder he's committing and taking in 
all the horror which is also wonderfully effective, but the previous 
shot is even better: more morally complex and more gut-wrenching. In 
short, probably the best piece of direction Raimi's ever done, 
demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something 
yields the best results (for further proof, watch "Persona"'s "sex 
scene" and witness what may be the best scene Ingmar Bergman's ever 
done).</P>
<P>But the film hardly stops here; it follows completely through and rarely 
loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof. Yet it 
also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never 
feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story. 
When the time comes for Paxton to start becoming selfish and thus 
diabolical (with aid from his pregnant wife, played by Bridget Fonda, a 
pal to Raimi), he does, and soon the horror of the situation is 
escalating to tragic heights. There's at least two grand shootouts, and 
at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema 
history, and when they arrive, they don't come with masochistic delight 
but with cringe-inducing horror. During the one, I was actually sinking 
into my chair, with the mantra "they can't do this, can they?" streeming 
through my head. In fact, this film, which is getting many comparisons 
to the Coen's [superior, but forget about it] "Fargo," has many similar 
moments of manic insanity, attributed to the major amount of subtlety 
and restraint with which the directors direct what, in other hands, 
would be over-the-top distractedness (imagine, I suppose, Robert 
Rodriguez directing this...then again, after seeing the "Evil Dead" 
films, I'd hardly assume Raimi would be able to pull something like this 
off, although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed 
"Raimi" moments, a rifle-shot notwithstanding).</P>
<P>Instead, Raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch, easily letting 
the story and characters co-exist, while still letting some of the more 
traditional Raimi elements come out, like some offbeat comic touches. 
Most particularly, Billy Bob Thornton's character, Jacob, is a brilliant 
creation. His dim-wittedness is often hilarious (for most of the film, 
every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter), but there's 
authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that 
we're not totally laughing at him. The chuckles he gets are not 
necessarily ones of full-condescension because Thornton is so damn real. 
Jacob's a multi-dimensional character, and while being stupid, we see 
that as not so much a flaw, but a strength to his character: his 
simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a 
strong inner strength and belief system, primarily towards the middle 
where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves 
concerning the money. The final third of the film spends much time with 
him, and many of the touches upon his character, not only by Thornton 
but also by screenwriter Scott B. Smith (adapting his own book, by the 
way) are just great. I particularly admired a back story about an old 
high school girlfriend, told by Thornton with such sincerity and 
acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further 
strength of his saddened character. Thornton is absolutely brilliant in 
this performance, by far the best performance he's ever given and 
further proof that he's the best character actor in contemporary cinema 
(if you don't believe me, go back and watch his wonderful performance in 
"Primary Colors," a performance that would have been nominated for an 
Oscar if this hadn't been in the same year) because he's easily able to 
slip into a character, and make him completely and utterly believable. 
He brings so much weight to the film that, as it is with most character 
actors, it's difficult picturing anyone else in the role.</P>
<P>The rest of the cast is great too, from Paxton's declining working man 
to Chelcie Ross' amiable town sheriff. Even Fonda shows off her talents 
nicely. And if I had any complaints about the film, it's that the plot 
is almost too simplistic, and that at times, it seems too much like an 
exercise, like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the 
humanity involved. And the occasional narration is, as it usually is, 
annoying (narration should be used with extreme caution, especially when 
you're trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn't Raimi 
watch the first murder scene?). And, the thing that can most usually go 
wrong with a movie, the ending is basically amiss. I won't reveal it, 
but it's way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up, as if the 
appearance of a plane wasn't already too much of that anyway. For a film 
that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters 
involved, this is the wrong ending. Imagine a character-controlled 
ending; otherwise, it's like if in "Crime and Punishment" if the police 
had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing...not that 
I'm at all comparing "A Simple Plan" to Dostoevsky. The ending does 
work, despite my protestations, but to me, there was something 
incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it; but if you had no qualms 
and were happy as a clam with it, then just ignore me and go about your 
day. But despite my mere claims, make no mistake that I was completely 
and utterly edge of my seat throughout, and even sometimes curdling up 
by the situations that occured, not because of any kind of gore factor 
(which is, thankfully for this, very minimal), but because the film 
places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things 
to overcome that I've frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile. At 
least not since the previous worthy Hitchcockian masterpiece.</P>
