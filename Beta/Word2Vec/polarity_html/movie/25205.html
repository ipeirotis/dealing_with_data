<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Don McKellar's witty debut film "Last Night" is about the end of the
world. It tells how a number of people in Toronto intend to spend their
last hours from 6 p.m. till midnight. Those we see, either have a
farewell dinner, get nostalgic over old home videos, play their most
memorable music (Pete Seeger singing "Kum Ba Yah"), pray to God, gather
for a street celebration, give a piano concert, get violent, or fulfill
their sexual fantasies. McKellar goes for the smaller private moments
rather than a grand philosophical argument about the meaning of life or
a catastrophic special effect ending. Because of that, everything
becomes personal for the small group whose selected stories run parallel
to the demise of the world.</P>
<P>Why Doomsday is upon the world is never explained; we only know that
there is no doubt that it will take place and all the inhabitants of the
city are resigned to that. The focus of the film isn't on any sort of
biblical apocalypse, nor is it on the outside revellers and looters, or
on those who gather in the city square to make it a New Year's eve
celebration, but it is on those who think out what they want to do and
plan to spend a thoughtful evening preparing for the end.</P>
<P>The Wheeler family uses the catastrophe as an excuse to make this a
Christmas celebration, believing that even if it isn't Christmas that
day was the most memorable one for the family and the day of the year
they most fondly remember. The dinner is presided over by Mr. and Mrs.
Wheeler, their elderly guests are Rose and Mrs. Wheeler's mother, their
only son Patrick (Don McKellar), who is scolded for arriving an hour
late, his sister (Polley), who brings along her husband (Trent).
Patrick's parents are disturbed that he wants to spend the final moments
alone and not join them in praying to God at the end.</P>
<P>Patrick's sister and her husband plan to go to the square and celebrate
with the masses gathered at the square.</P>
<P>Sandra Oh's car was disabled by some rowdies, and she is stuck at a
grocery store on the opposite side of town from where she lives. She is
anxious to get home to her husband of two months, whom she loves very
much and made a suicide pact so that they would die together before
midnight by shooting each other simultaneously with her two berettas,
that is, after celebrating life together with a last meal, which she has
gathered from the grocery store that has just been looted. She is trying
to phone him but none of the public phones work, thereby she meets
Patrick who is returning to his apartment and talks him into letting her
use his apartment phone. She can't reach her husband and the two
strangers are brought together, trying to relate to each other in a
civil manner. Sandra needs a car to drive crosstown to get home, since
there is no other transportation available, and Patrick acts as the
perfect gentleman trying to get her a car while secretly wishing she
would stay with him.</P>
<P>Craig (Callum Keith Rennie) is busy that evening fulfilling his long
checklist of sexual accomplishments he wants to complete before dying.
We first see him when a prostitute (Glave) comes to his luxury
apartment, she is to be the first black woman he made love to. He then
has his high school French teacher (Genevieve Bujold), someone he has
always been attracted to, come over so he can act on that longtime
sexual fantasy.</P>
<P>Patrick, in his failed attempt to get a car for Sandra from the street,
remembers that he sold his antique car to his old high school friend
Craig and goes over there, but is surprised to meet his old French
teacher in the apartment, his immediate response is to revert back to
their relationship of teacher-pupil. Craig is at first unwilling to give
up such a valuable possession as his antique car, but gets talked into
it. When Sandra leaves in the car, Craig tells Patrick that on his
sexual list of things, is a homosexual fling. But Craig can't get all
his wishes, so he will have to settle for his next visitor, the
thirty-something virgin (Tracy). He always wanted a virgin and now will
fulfill his last sex wish just before midnight.</P>
<P>In the business section of town, the director of a gas company
(Cronenberg) phones all his customers to assure them the gas company
will keep doing their job until the end and then goes home to eat some
Ben and Jerry's ice cream in his meticulous apartment, only to be
disturbed by a violent intruder.</P>
<P>Patrick is prepared to die alone absorbed in thoughts about his dearly
departed wife, but is interrupted again by Sandra, who couldn't make it
through the hostile crowd, and asks if they could spend the final
moments together. They briefly tell each other their life story, both of
them feeling something strong growing inside them, but she wants to know
more about him, as she tells him: "Tell me something to make me love
you."</P>
<P>The film has an impinging discreteness and courtesy about it that
elevates the critical situation into a chance for the characters to
depart from the world maintaining what they believe in. The sardonic
humor and clever performances by Sandra Oh, Don McKellar and Callum
Keith Rennie, leave a lasting impression. Sandra and Don make their
experiences seem so vitally human, while Callum remains the eternal
materialist. The premise is a question that many people have asked
themselves, as I recall parties where the game played was to say how you
would like to die, and the responses were always so varied and
revealing.</P>
