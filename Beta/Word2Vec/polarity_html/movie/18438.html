<P>     To your list of absolute cinematic oxymorons -- you know, like "Pauly
Shore comedy" or "Keanu Reeves performance" -- please add the following:
"bittersweet farce."  That's the disastrous combination served up by THE
LOVE LETTER, a film that fairly screams for a more frivolous treatment.
The basic set-up is pure farce, with bookstore proprietor and recent
divorcee Helen MacFarquahar (Kate Capshaw) of picturesque Loblolly by the
Sea, Massachusetts discovering a beautifully poetic love letter between
the cushions of a couch in her shop.  Both the the writer and the
addressee are anonymous, leading Helen to wonder if it might be for her.
Her suspicions become stronger when her young summer employee Johnny (Tom
Everett Scott) begins flirting with her, little realizing that Johnny has
spotted the letter and believes, in turn, that it is from Helen to him.</P>
<P>     Thus begins a tale which initially appears headed towards a wild
sequence of misunderstandings, as Helen's co-worker Janet (Ellen
DeGeneres) also spies the letter and suspects it to be to her from hunky
fireman George (Tom Selleck).  That might have been a clever, breezy
entertainment, something considerably less labored than the mess delivered
by screenwriter Maria Maggenti (from Cathleen Schine's novel) and director
Peter Ho-sun Chan.  Their tale is intended, I suppose, to be a touching
tale of a middle-aged woman trying to re-discover romance, a sensitively
portrayed May-December relationship mixed with the star-crossed
interactions of Helen and high school classmate George (who, it turns out,
has carried a torch from afar for lo these twenty years).  We should
understand the way the letter affects Helen, the way it closes one door in
her life and opens her up to the opportunities she has missed and the
opportunities still to come.</P>
<P>     If Maggenti and Chan had offered some characters remotely resembling
three-dimensional people, it might even have worked.  THE LOVE LETTER
makes no effort whatsoever to explain Johnny's interest in Helen, spends
about thirty seconds establishing Janet as little more than comic relief
before creating a blink-and-you'll-miss-it sub-plot regarding her jealousy
of Helen, and wraps up with an out-of-left-field relationship between two
characters about whom we know virtually nothing.  Key relationships (like
that between Helen and her absentee mother, played by Blythe Danner)
materialize out of thin air, and supporting characters (like Helen's
grandmother, played by TITANIC's Gloria Stuart) serve no purpose.  Even
Capshaw's Helen, the film's center, is an enigma.  For a film that
apparently wants you to care who ends up with whom, THE LOVE LETTER gives
you none of the tools to do so.  It's a whodunnit with no clues.</P>
<P>     Somehow, in the middle of this clumsy confection, one genuinely
interesting character appears.  As Jennifer, another employee of Helen's
who dotes on unrequitedly on Johnny, Julianne Nicholson is wonderfully
sweet and achingly self-conscious.  Masking her insecurities behind her
college course sociological analysis, she makes for a great character in a
story of how romantic happiness can be thwarted both from without and
within.  The troublie is, she's the only character in the film who belongs
in such a story.  Everyone else plays the kind of functional, cardboard
role you'd expect to find in...well, a farce about a love letter of
unknown authorship changing hands indiscriminately.  There's not a solid
laugh to be found in this pretty to look at but ill-conceived romantic
comedy, except at the idea that someone thought a bittersweet farce could
work.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 dead letters:  3.</PRE>
