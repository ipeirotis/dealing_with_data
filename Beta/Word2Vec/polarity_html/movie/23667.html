<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It's a strange world-- alright, an artificial nostalgic world that David
Lynch depicts of close neighbors, friendly dogs, of red roses growing
against a white picket fence, a clear blue sky, and the nice suburban
homes that are shown in the beginning and at the end of the film. There
are also the cheerful sounds of the radio DJ announcing the time "at the
sound of the falling tree." There is also a dark side to life that David
Lynch (Eraserhead/The Elephant Man/Dune) wants to show you in the
underbelly of normalcy and that's what gets explored in this fantastic,
original American film of his.</P>
<P>Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is a young college-aged man returning
to his home town of Lumberton, USA, after his father had a stroke and he
must run the family hardware store. The routines of suburban life
changes for him when he picks up a severed human ear in the field by his
house and brings it to his neighbor Detective Williams (George
Dickerson).</P>
<P>Jeffrey meets Detective Williams' attractive daughter, the high school
student Sandy (Laura Dern), outside her house and she intriguingly tells
him that she overheard her father talking about the case, and that they
are investigating the singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini ), who
resides in an apartment in the neighborhood. Jeffrey feels adventurous
and romantically inclined toward Sandy and talks her into showing him
the building where the singer lives. He then devices a plan so that he
can sneak into the apartment and snoop around.</P>
<P>Hiding in the slatted closet, Jeffrey gets an eyeful of the attractive
singer parading around in panties and bra and sees her have one of the
weirdest sexual encounters ever in filmdom, as a deranged gangster,
Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) enters her apartment and begins a
sadomasochistic tryst with her. He beats her, orders her not to look at
him, yells obsenities at her, inhales some kind of drugs from a
cylinder, and rapes her. Upon coming out of the closet, Jeffrey
discovers that she actually enjoys being abused as he begins a
sadomasochistic romance himself with the mentally unbalanced woman, as
she performs fellatio on him and gets him to beat her. He does what she
asks him to do, even though he didn't want to love her that way. The
singer's child and, possibly, her husband are being held captive by
Frank. It is also possible that the severed ear, is her husband's.</P>
<P>She will sing in her nightclub act the titled song from the film, where
Jeffrey watches her perform.</P>
<P>Jeffrey has entered into a dark world of madness, a world that most of
the people of Lumberton could never imagine exists in their community.
His curiosity becomes his admission to a world of drugs, kidnaping,
murder, violence, and sexual perversions. Frank will take him on a joy
ride where he is forced to meet some crazed thugs who intimidate him and
Ben (Dean Stockwell), an effeminate drug dealer and pimp, will
humiliatingly slap him. He will end the joy ride by being severely
beaten by Frank as a warning to keep away.</P>
<P>Hopper is madly funny and menacing in one of his all-time best
over-the-edge roles. He is the energy of the film. He has lines like
"let me f*ck everything that movies!".  In what goes for conversation,
he asks MacLachlan, "What kind of beer do you like?" MacLachlan:
"Heineken" Hopper: "f*ck that shit, Pabst Blue Ribbon!"</P>
<P>There were many quirky moments in a film that was as straight as a curve
ball. The romance Kyle has with the innocent Dern is cleverly compared
with the maddening passion of his romance with the not-so innocent
Rossellini. The conversations with Dern, who constantly looks like she
lost something in the translation, while with Rossellini, it is
unbridled sex she has on her mind. One conversation between Dern and
Kyle goes like this: Laura: "I don't know if you are a detective or a
pervert!" Jeff: "That's for me to know and you to find out."</P>
<P>This is a highly personal film. For those looking to criticize it these
might be some reasons to do so: it relies on shock to tell its
forgettable story, it fails to develop character emphasizing style
instead, and the acting seems more staged than spontaneous. Some might
be overwrought upon viewing the naked singer, as she appears on the lawn
of the detective's house and seems to be irrationally babbling. They may
be looking upon it as the mocking of a helpless woman. True. It was
shocking to see, but I didn't feel that Lynch glossed over this scene
lightly. I think it set a mood for how painful and humiliating life is,
and these incidences do happen more regularly in contemporary America
than some would care to admit. All these possible flaws in the film,
still do not detract from how visually powerful the story was and how it
had such a unique feel to it, as if it were capturing something about
the American heartland that hasn't been told in this way before.</P>
<P>I loved the film for its intransigencies. What it has going for it in
large measures is a sense of freshness, imagination, and an almost
seamless melding of beauty and violence. It is a dark visionary tale
encompassing the conventional lives of the protagonists when pitted
against their antagonists, and it offers a genuine sense of terror with
a devilish peek at the sexual subconscious, as even the innocent find
under unusual circumstances they will do something they might ordinarily
not do. This non-commercial film should satisfy Lynch's fans and those
looking for a film that doesn't pull its punches. Others might dislike
it for being so plainly weird and shock-orientated, admiring it only for
its craftsmanship. I think they will have sold this film short; after
all, strange stuff happens all the time, and the most interesting people
are the so called "normal" ones. When such a normal character becomes
tempted by evil and battles inside for his integrity, the battles
usually prove interesting. I believe that is what happened in this film,
and though its motivations are ambiguous, it does hit some kind of sore
spot for respectable society to consider, without turning up its nose at
all the revolting things this story brought to the surface.</P>
