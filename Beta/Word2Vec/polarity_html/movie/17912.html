RUSHMORE (director: Wes Anderson; cast: Jason Schwartzman (Max Fischer),
Bill Murray (Blume), Olivia  Williams (Miss Cross), Brian Cox (Dr.
Guggenheim), Seymour Cassel  (Bert Fischer), Mason Gamble (Dirk
Calloway), Sara Tanaka (Margaret Yang), Stephen McCole (Magnus Buchan),
Ronnie McCawley (Ronny Blume), Keith McCawley (Donny Blume), Luke Wilson
(Dr. Peter Flynn), 1998)</P>
<P>This is a fantasy film that comically depicts one current student making
contact with another former student of the same school, who is now a
tycoon, who when he looks back at his high school days, might recall
what it was about those years that now fill him with nostalgia, and how
he might be an influence to other students not considered to be top
flight students yet who possess the guts it takes to become successful.</P>
<P>RUSHMORE opens, as an irrepressible sophomore at an elite private
school, the 15-year-old Max Fischer (Schwartzman), who is the future
tycoon, is daydreaming that he can solve an impossible math problem his
math teacher put on the board for extra-credit that no one else in the
world can solve. In reality, he is a poor academic student, having won a
scholarship to the school when he was in the 2nd grade, by staging a
play that the headmaster (Brian Cox ) of Rushmore Academy was impressed
with. His father is the town barber, but Max prefers to tell people that
his father is a neurosurgeon. The father is paternally played with a
very sweet charm, by veteran actor, Seymour Cassel.</P>
<P>This is an original and quirky story, but it also follows a long
tradition of films that took similar routes (FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF,
THE GRADUATE), so what seems to be taking place and in what direction it
is going and who Max is, cannot be simply or absolutely stated, which is
great in some ways but completely mind-blowing in other ways, as this
somewhat cheesy story has more holes in it than Swiss cheese, yet no
matter how it seems to be served, it always seems to be a story that is
tastefully done.</P>
<P>Max appears with thick spectacles, wearing braces, and not appealing to
girls or not even liked by any one on campus except for a young student
he is an advisor to, Dirk (Mason), who acts as a loyal subject to Max's
cause, only disillusioned when he hears that Max made some sexually
disparaging remarks about his mother. Max is not exactly a nerd, as he
is pushy, being neither completely likable nor obnoxious, who propels
himself into the Rushmore scene by pursuing extra-curricular activities
to such a degree that it reaches the point of absurdity, as he is
involved in so many diverse activities, that it is a wonder he has time
to even take off the preppy jacket he loves to wear around the campus.
The list of his activities includes: Beekeepers Club, The Dodgeball
Society, The French Club, The Debating Team, The Fencing Team, editor of
the school's paper, The Piper Cub Club, The Max Fischer Players, they
put on plays, which seem ridiculously overplayed, such as Serpico in
which he directs and stars in.</P>
<P>Rushmore is Max's symbolic place, tantamount to that august mountain top
where replicas of some of our greatest presidents are carved in stone.
It is at Rushmore where he is bursting with untold energy for adventure,
entrepenureship, and romance. Everything he does is what someone his age
might want to do or dream about, but he carries it out from fantasy land
into the real world, not deterred by what others may think of him, or of
how totally off-the-wall he appears. Oblivious to his poor school work,
except when the headmaster reminds him that if he doesn't improve his
grades, he will be expelled from school, scholarship or not.</P>
<P>He falls foolishly in love with a 25-year-old elementary teacher at the
school, charmingly played by Miss Cross (Williams), who looks bemusedly
perplexed at him, but, nevertheless, somehow admires him for the effort
he puts forth in stating his feelings for her. Her husband recently
died, but spoke fondly of his attending Rushmore, which is the reason
she chose for coming here to teach. Max plans to win her over by
building her an aquarium, as a token of his affection. The money for
this pie-in-the-sky project will come from a steel tycoon, Herman Blume
(Murray), whom he met after the former graduate of the school gave a
speech there that seemed to only impress him, as the tycoon told what
the school meant to him, in a flippant way that alumni usually don't
reminisce about when giving a formal speech in an auditorium.</P>
<P>Blume, as the present day tycoon looking back at his days at Rushmore,
as the springboard of his success, just as he looks back at his marriage
with remorse, develops a natural kinship with Max, the
tycoon-in-waiting, that is beautifully presented by an understated
performance by Murray, who draws comedy by just raising an eyebrow at
the right moment or when befuddled lighting two cigarettes in his mouth,
and who evinces pathos when he seems inundated by his dislike of himself
for the unfeeling person he has become.</P>
<P>There are many twists to come into play as the story is disarmingly
told, forcing us not too get too comfortable in what we expect to be a
sane commentary of the going-ons here. The twist in the story that works
best, and is both hilariously amusing and deadly serious, is that Blume,
trapped in a loveless marriage, falls for the teacher, also, and is able
to romance her. Max acts particularly upset by this turn of events,
venting out at all the parties he perceives are hurting him. These
scenes were wickedly cruel to comprehend, as the story flipped over from
comedy to psychological drama, and to a certain extent, a temporary
suspension of belief. Yet it was this facet of the story that was most
novel and daring about the film, as it let the characters freely play
out who they were without contrivance. Therefore, even if you didn't
particularly care about the way things were going, you were at least
taken aback by seeing how everyone interacted with each other. Max
showing himself to be rude and insulting, going to great lengths to end
the relationship between the two lovers, somehow believing that he
should have been taken seriously as a real suitor. Blume retaliating by
smashing the kid's bike. Max getting back at Blume, by cutting the
brakes to Blume's Bentley. Miss Cross by showing that she's a sensitive
and vulnerable woman, who wants to feel alive and romantic, and doesn't
really understood that she is being wooed by men who can't take no for
an answer.This is the part of the film that I had the most problems
with, especially when we see her going out with an attractive doctor
(Luke), a Harvard graduate, like she is, and he seems to be the odd man
out for no decipherable reason that the story expands on.</P>
<P>When Max gets kicked out of Rushmore and goes to the inferior public
high school, he continues to do poorly in his school work but will excel
once again in extra-curricular activities, even putting on an
anti-Vietnam War play with live ammo, requiring the audience to put on
earplugs and wear goggles. He even finds an Oriental girlfriend
(Tanaka), who is not quite the scientist she seems to be, which in this
case is a good thing, because that makes her just about right for Max.</P>
<P>The young director's previous film, BOTTLE ROCKET, was also written by
him with Owen Wilson, it was also quirky but a bit less professionally
done. Both films show promise of better things to come. There are still
patches to this story that need further developing and to be pruned
along the edges before we can say we have things in order, but after
saying that, I must say that this is still a first-rate film, with a lot
of bite to it, depicting characters in a discrete way that allows them
to be very real and formidable. This is Bill Murray's best role yet, and
for newcomer, Jason Schwartzman, the son of actress Talia Shire, a role
made for him in filmdom heaven.</P>
