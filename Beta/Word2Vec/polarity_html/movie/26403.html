<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"The Tao of Steve" is a likable romantic comedy about an obese comman
man type who happens to have the extraordinary ability to be a
successful seducer of women despite his unappealing looks, convinced he
is scoring women because of his philosophy. The philosophy takes
something that is Eastern, of being desireless and without attachments,
and he adds to it an homage to three famous Steves and their masculine
auras: Steve Austin from The Six Million Dollar Man, Steve Garret from
Hawaii Five-O, and the late film star Steve McQueen. When the philosophy
is working, he has put sex out of his mind and the result is that women
end up finding him to be cool, and go to bed with him because of his
laidback attitude.</P>
<P>The humble film, producing some earnest chuckles, is Jenniphr Goodman's
debut as a director; she wrote the screenplay with her sister Greer
Goodman and Duncan North, as Greer also plays the co-star Syd. The film
is based on the real life of the obese Duncan, a friend of the
director's from where they live in Santa Fe. The film is slightly
offbeat, feeling very natural and human, and offering a chance for the
characters to be somewhat fleshed out as they intermingle and search for
relationships. The film played well and was enjoyable in poking holes at
how insincere and ready for a downfall the main character was, but the
obvious plot and the predictable way the film was going, defeated its
zen-like approach, wanting too much to resolve things by contrivances
instead of surrendering to a more natural ending. Yet I enjoyed the film
and its loopy moments and thought it did a good job of catching the
banter that goes on between the twenty-somethings, struggling to make
relationships and fight their fear of loneliness.</P>
<P>Donal Logue is charming as Dex, once a thin ladies' man, being then an
arrogant and very smart college student, who now attends his college
reunion of ten years and is a very fat, pot-smoking, part-time
kindergarten teacher in Santa Fe, N.M., endowed only with his best asset
from college: a sense of humor.</P>
<P>At the party, he meets the blonde with a great smile, Syd, who was in
his philosophy class but he can't remember her name or that he slept
with her. He is attracted to her, willing to throw aside his other
conquests, such as the married Beth (Ayelet), to be with her. But she is
mad that he didn't even recognize her.</P>
<P>Syd is staying for the summer with their mutual college friends (Nina
Jaroslaw & David Aaron Baker), a happily married couple, and will soon
be returning to her New York job as a set designer for the opera.</P>
<P>Dex is living in a communal house with some guys, where he is a mentor
to the womanless,  Gomer Pyle-like Dave (Kimo Wills), laying on him his
Tao-Steve philosophy. Dex is seen interacting with his roommates in an
engaging way, still acting like he hasn't matured. At work, he is great
with the kids, dancing with them, playing games, and giving them a good
teaching experience. He also has a loving relationship with his
retriever dog Astral.</P>
<P>Philosophy comes out of Dex's mouth with the ease of a braggart. But he
has met his match with Syd, as the two discuss Kierkegaard's dark secret
nature and compare it with the opera Don Giovanni, which takes on the
film's theme and makes way for relating that to the eventual
transcendence of Dex. The opera star we are told was a seducer of
thousands of women because he was afraid that one woman wouldn't love
him.</P>
<P>In his attempt to be with Syd, he fails to fix his motorcycle and
thereby manuevers a ride from her to work, giving him a second chance to
see if he could win her over again. He also gets invited on a camping
trip with her and their mutual friends, even though he hates the outdoor
experience. He takes advantage of the camping trip to tell her how much
he cares for her, breaking all the rules of his philosophy. But she sees
through his myth and is too sharp-witted for him to pull his philosophy
ruse off. But their relationship will prosper again, when they both
recognize their faults: he's stuck at being a seducer, a slob, lacking
drive and ambition, while she seems uptight, unable to loosen up and
have fun.</P>
<P>That this film works in the way most romantic Hollywood films work from
since when, with its storybook ending intact...did not disturb me to the
point of dismissing the film. That the script allowed this unlikely
romance to succeed no matter what, never deterred it from being a fun
film. The joy is in watching Dex and Syd, in all their reactions and
struggles, somehow change and get together. The film reminded me of
those old-fashioned Hollywood studio films of the '30s and '40s, only
updated to take in the new trends and hip language used by those living
in modern times.</P>
