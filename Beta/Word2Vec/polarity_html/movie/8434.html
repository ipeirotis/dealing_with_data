<P>     As I've said before, predictability can often be a great asset for 
a romantic comedy.  So far this summer, we've had three very atypical 
entries:  'TIL THERE WAS YOU (where the man and woman don't meet until 
the end), ADDICTED TO LOVE (a revenge fantasy), and MY BEST FRIEND'S 
WEDDING (where not everything goes as expected).  Now, August ushers in 
PICTURE PERFECT, a harmless movie intent upon restoring formulaic 
comfort to the genre.  There's nothing remotely surprising about this 
movie, unless it's how embarrassingly bad the resolution is.</P>
<P>     For eighty minutes of PICTURE PERFECT's one-hundred minute running 
time, I found myself smiling quite often.  As obvious and unambitious as 
the film was, I actually liked it, and was prepared to file it into the 
"guilty pleasures" category.  Then came the horrible one-two punch of 
the climax.  I was flabbergasted.  My smile turned into a cringe.  There 
are times when a bad ending doesn't seriously damage a motion picture.  
This is not one of those.  All of the goodwill I had built up during the 
bulk of the film was replaced by irritation at the silly, contrived 
conclusion.  And the worst part is that the movie could easily have 
achieved the same resolution in a far more satisfactory manner.  
Apparently, director and co-screenwriter Glenn Gordon Caron prefers high 
melodrama to something more low-key.</P>
<P>     It's a shame, because the ill-advised finale puts a damper on 
Jennifer Aniston's first starring role in a major motion picture (we'll 
ignore LEPRECHAUN, which is probably what she'd prefer that we do).  
I've never been a big fan of Aniston in her TV series, FRIENDS, but 
she's very good in the role of PICTURE PERFECT's protagonist.  As Kate, 
she's smart, witty, and appealing, yet manages to convey a degree of 
vulnerability, uncertainty, and downright nastiness.  In short, she 
shows the beginnings of three dimensionality.</P>
<P>     Kate is a junior agent for Mercer Advertising.  She has a quick 
mind, but, even after she devises the tag line for a major ad campaign, 
she is passed over as a member of the account team.  The reason:  she's 
too much of a free spirit.  The boss, Mr. Mercer (Kevin Dunn), wants 
someone who's married and living in a house, not a single woman who's 
lifestyle mirrors the one she had when she was in college.  So, while 
Kate is venting her frustration in the lavatory (this one scene single-
handedly earns the movie a PG-13 rating), her best friend, Darcy 
(Illeana Douglas), concocts a story to advance Kate's career.  Using a 
photo of Kate with a guy named Nick (Jay Mohr), whom she only met once, 
Darcy spins a tale to her boss about Kate's impending nuptials.  Mercer 
immediately softens his stance and puts Kate on the team.</P>
<P>     Although Kate is initially horrified by Darcy's fabrication, she 
soon learns to appreciate its advantages.  A co-worker, Sam (Kevin 
Bacon), who will only sleep with married and engaged women, suddenly 
finds Kate irresistible.  Everything seems to be going right until 
Mercer absolutely, positively has to meet Nick.  Unable to string her 
boss along any longer, Kate travels to New England in search of the man 
in the photograph.  When she finds him, she offers him a proposition:  
she'll pay him $1000 if he comes to New York with her, takes her to 
dinner, then stages a public break-up.  Nick, who is attracted to Kate 
and is willing to jump at any chance to spend time with her, agrees.</P>
<P>     For the most part, PICTURE PERFECT has a nice, light romantic mood.  
Caron, who wrote for the TV series MOONLIGHTING and directed the Warren 
Beatty/Annette Bening remake of LOVE AFFAIR, clearly has a feel for love 
stories.  Early in the film, during a wedding sequence, the camera 
subtly captures the bliss of being in a couple and the loneliness of 
being single.  This idealized view of romance is then used as the 
springboard to the movie's central plot.  The movie ends with another 
wedding, but the less said about that, the better.  </P>
<P>     Aniston is ably supported by a group of fine actors.  Kevin Bacon 
is delightful as Sam, a man who enjoys one-night stands with unavailable 
women, then finds that he may be falling for Kate.  Olympia Dukakis has 
a few amusing scenes as Kate's overprotective mother.  Illeana Douglas 
is delightful as the effervescent Darcy.  And Jay Mohr is solid, if 
unspectacular, as Nick (some viewers may have difficulty erasing the 
memory of him as the oily agent from JERRY MAGUIRE).</P>
<P>     In general, I consider myself to be a defender of romantic 
comedies, even if they're not terribly original.  There's something 
refreshing about that kind of pure escapism.  Unfortunately, PICTURE 
PERFECT uses embarrassing contrivances to sabotage what should have been 
a pleasant excursion down a familiar road.  Still, even considering its 
flaws, I think a certain percentage of die-hard romantics will derive 
some satisfaction from this movie.  I wish I had been in that category, 
but PICTURE PERFECT makes a few too many missteps to earn my 
recommendation.</P>
