<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>David Lynch (Eraserhead/Lost Highway/Blue Velvet/Wild at Heart/Twin
Peaks) switches filmmaking gears and goes from his hipster style of
making weirdo films to making a simple heart-rendering story of a
73-year-old from Laurens, Iowa, Alvin Straight (Farnsworth-he's actually
79), who rides his ancient Rehds lawnmower with a trailer hitched to it
until that breaks down and he has to splurge for $250 and get a 1966
John Deere to take him the 300 miles he needs to go- which takes a
little over five weeks- to see his brother Lyle (Stanton) in Mount Zion,
Wisconsin.</P>
<P>The film is most like a timeless spiritual quest, something Alvin feels
he has to do in order to make peace with himself and with his brother.
This is after a bitter argument, which kept him from not seeing or
hearing from him for the last 10 years, but now he learns that his
brother has just suffered a stroke.</P>
<P>Alvin's mentally impaired daughter, Rose (Sissy), lives with him after
the state took away her four kids due to a fire in the house, even
though it was not her fault, as Alvin adds, she got a raw deal from the
state, though there seems to be no bitterness in his tone.</P>
<P>Alvin's eyesight is so poor, that he doesn't have a driver's license, he
walks with a cane, has a bad hip, has emphysema, and is as stubborn as a
mule; therefore, even though, it doesn't make too much sense to travel
the way he does, no one can talk him out of it. He will not have his
daughter drive him or take a bus or let a stranger he meets on the road
take him there; he feels that this is something he just has to do by
himself.</P>
<P>The film reeks of Midwestern wholesomeness, folksiness, and homespun
philosophies. That it works so well, is a testament to Richard
Farnsworth's compelling characterization and the flavor the film
captures of the genuine straight people playing straight man to Alvin
Straight on the two-lane highway he takes across the Mississippi River
to Wisconsin. It features a road show of ordinary folks, consisting of
those who can be kind to a stranger who is doing something he probably
ought not be doing. Their ordinary lives are put under the microscope in
a slow-moving tale that is not in a hurry to get to the end of its
journey, as the strangers talk to each other, seriously listen to each
other, and we as an audience get to know all of them reasonably well. As
a change of pace, American viewers might welcome a pause from all the
action films and whacky stories they are inundated with, and take a
reality check to see if they are interested in seeing a film that most
of them could have been in.</P>
<P>This is a fictionalized version of a true story that took place in
September/October of 1994 and was discovered by the screenwriters from
an article in the "N.Y. Times."</P>
<P>The film plays as if it was a foreign film, since it is rare for an
American film to be so self-conscious of itself, so interested in just
looking at the open blue sky, the blowing wheatfields, the bare streets
of a sleepy town, and having its star find peace with himself without
any reason or big event in the film. It is also a film that knows how to
keep proper time with its slow-moving story and the slow-moving
transport of its hero. By doing this, it suggests that his life can be
carefully digested without everything being brought to a conclusion
before it needs to be.</P>
<P>Some of the vignettes worked better than others, but what was always
convincing was how the unsophisticated but straight-forward manner of
Farnsworth, came across in such an appealing way, a way many Americans
would like to think of themselves as actually being.</P>
<P>His encounter with a runaway young pregnant hitchhiker, whom he advises
to go back home, seemed too pat for it to be a moving experience, as
true as her sad story might be and as good as his advise to her was.
Yet, Lynch handled it correctly by just indicating by her changing
facial expressions that something was clicking inside her and that she
was becoming less confused about what to do, and by having her
symbolically show that she understood what Alvin told her to do. His
encounter with an hysterical lady who keeps hitting deer with her car on
her way to work, also seemed too overblown a situation to even comment
on his failure to ease her anguish. Fortunately, nothing much is made of
this event, except Alvin has the common sense to have some deer meat for
his nightly camp fire. But when Alvin's tractor belt breaks going down a
steep hill and he is shaken, he is befriended by Danny Riordan (Cada), a
retired John Deere employee, who was at the time watching a practice
fire exercise in this sleepy town. He looks upon Alvin as the national
treasure he is, taking Alvin back to his yard to camp out while he gets
the town's mechanics, bickering twins, to repair the tractor, as Alvin
has a go at getting the brothers to relate to each other in a more
amiable manner.</P>
<P>The film moves into territory where people of good nature really
communicate with each other and offer whatever support they can to each
other, and it is the right support because they have tapped into the
source that gives them such character, which is what the kindly
relationship that developed between Danny and Alvin offered. Alvin also
meets, an old-timer he instantly relates to, and since this is an
odyssey where one of its primary purposes is of reliving the past, and
Alvin throughout the journey is bringing up tidbits about his life, what
comes up now is the dark secret from his days fighting in WW11,
something he couldn't tell anyone, it is when he was a sniper and had
the misfortune of unknowingly killing someone on his side; and, who
better to tell this too than this WW11 veteran with such a kindly face,
who quietly understood everything Alvin was saying, knowing full-well
how farm boys came back from the war with images of the horrors they had
been through and couldn't face themselves anymore and took to drinking.
Alvin has already faced his drinking problem, and now that he has
confessed to what has been eating away at him all these years, he seems
to be ready to fulfill his life by just seeing his brother again and
making peace with him.</P>
<P>He will encounter a priest when he camps out on one of the oldest
cemeteries in Wisconsin, and they will have a friendly discussion about
religion, indicating that there's not much difference between Alvin's
Baptist faith and the priest's Catholicism. His last meaningful
encounter, before he ends up on the porch of his brother's shack and is
looking up at the night sky, is with an old-time bartender, who serves
him a Miller light and gracefully talks the friendly chatter barkeeps
throughout the country are known for.</P>
<P>This film was just right for what it wanted to do; it felt good seeing
Alvin's journey find closure. The sentimentality of the film was kept to
the minimum and Lynch did not try to make this small story grander than
what it was, and that's a good thing, because the smallness of the story
is what made this film seem so elegant and it is also what made it seem
epic.</P>
<P>But, in a film that goes only surface deep in uncovering the mythos
about small-town America and its elderly, it becomes unfortunate that
the filmmaker couldn't delve deeper and get more out of the story, as it
seems as if this is a story waiting to be pried open even wider by
someone who is not stuck on what seems to be the obvious but wants to
make some waves with the politics of such small-town conservatism and
question why the towns look so dry and shrivelled-up, the people seem so
unintellectual, and the places visited so dull, notwithstanding, how
kindly its citizens can act in an emergency. After initially being very
pleased with the film, I got to wondering what I learned about Alvin
Straight that I didn't know when the film began; and, though I thought
that Alvin's reflections about his life were genuine, I still didn't
really know what he is all about by the film's end, even if I now knew
his darkest secret, and that is what troubles me most about this film.</P>
<P>There is something about his life that makes me think of Alvin as not
only a likable character, which is what I found him to be, but someone
who is so set-in-his-ways that he cannot evolve further, and he is
someone who is so accepting of the "American Way of Life," that it seems
a shame that he can't find anything to say that questions the America
and its institutions he was prepared to give his life for during WW11.
Lynch seems to have created a character that buys into all the
old-traditional values America supposedly cherishes but without
reexamining them, such as family values, religious institutions, and the
military. He would be someone who would make a good poster boy for the
religious right. There seems to be no rebel in Alvin, as Lynch seems to
accept his status quo without any hesitation.</P>
<P>Alvin, for all his appeal, just seems to be another blind follower of
the so-called American value system. It was difficult for me to see
Lynch's motivations for making this simple story without offering any
ruffles in the feathers of the American eagle. Though, he certainly has
a right to see things the way he does; it, nevertheless, is
disconcerting to see a film that is so accepting of the institutional
American values without even questioning them.</P>
<P>If this film was meant as a religious quest, then it failed in that
venture, especially when compared to the lives of other religious
figures' autobiographies who had to fight the conformity of society and
their own inner being until they were able through their journey to
raise their consciousness. But if this is just a mild tale about an
old-timer, doing something a little ornery, then it works and is
pleasant to look at, just like it is pleasant to have a conversation on
Main Street with some real people. It makes you feel good, but is that
challenging enough?</P>
<P>I still don't know what Lynch's motivation is for making this Walt
Disney family value production film, except it seems to be an ode to
traditional values, which seems odd coming from him, especially since he
is known, rightly or wrongly, for making films that are supposed to be
on-the-cutting-edge. There was nothing daring about this film, as its
appeal is mostly through the magnificent performance of Richard
Farnsworth, who is a movic relic, chiseled in dignity with his
weather-beaten face and his geezer-like sensibilities shining through.
He is someone beyond acting criticism, and whatever failings or
misplaced points there are to his story, the film is still a relatively
interesting work, retaining something about the American mythos that is
worth investigating further; this is a film that is well-crafted and
well-worth seeing, and this is so because Lynch knows how to film a
story in a thoroughly professional manner. As for Lynch personally, I
don't have the foggiest idea what his real beliefs are or what his
changing career moves might mean, but as far as this film goes, he seems
to be very accepting of the status quo.</P>
