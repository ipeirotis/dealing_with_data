<PRE>                              MEN WITH GUNS
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     As he looks wistfully at the photograph taken just three years
ago, the doctor puts his thumb on each smiling face.  The picture has
the men and one woman surrounding him like a father at a reunion of his
grown children.  They were all young doctors at the time, and he had
just finished training them in a well-intentioned plan to treat
tapeworms among the poor Indians of an unnamed Latin American country,
where the story takes place.  But he had recently begun to realize that
most of them had been murdered, and he covers their happy expressions
to remind himself that they have probably perished.  His sense of loss
becomes palpable in this moving drama and mystery, aptly called MEN
WITH GUNS.</P>
<P>     It wasn't as if he hadn't tried to report the tragedy to the
authorities.  When he found that the first doctor had been killed, he
went promptly to the local police to inform them of the tragedy.  And
the officer was indeed concerned.  He wanted to hear all about it so he
could go speak to those Indians immediately and stop these rumors.  Oh
yes, and could the doctor please show him his medical card to prove
that he was not a journalist.</P>
<P>     In MEN WITH GUNS John Sayles, one of our preeminent storytellers,
tackles another subject ignored by most other filmmakers.  He received
Oscar nominations for the scripts of LONE STAR and PASSION FISH, and he
has made movies ranging from dramas about baseball scandals (EIGHT MEN
OUT) to mystical tales about remote Scottish Islands (THE SECRET OF
ROAN INISH) to ones about union busting (MATEWAN).  One thing sure and
certain about Sayles's movies is that they will be highly intelligent
and worth a second or even a third viewing to savor the rich tapestry
he arrays in front of us.  He even bankrolls his own movies lest some
studio head dare suggest how he should approach his craft.</P>
<P>     Sayles, who taught himself Spanish, wrote the script directly in
Spanish and then had a Latin American native translate it into an
appropriate dialect.  Besides the Spanish, and a little English, many
of the actors speak in their native tongues of Nahuatl, Tzotzil, Maya
and Kuna.  The resulting tower of Babel, with easy to follow subtitles,
shows how hard it is for the country's people to communicate among
themselves.</P>
<P>     As MEN WITH GUNS starts, the upper-middle class Dr. Fuentes is
attending to his well-heeled clients.  When he sees one of his student
doctors back in the city rather than the village where he was sent, Dr.
Fuentes is nonplussed.  The nervous young man flees and, when trapped,
complains about how Dr. Fuentes is both the smartest and the most
ignorant man he knows.  The student alludes obliquely to some horrors
out in the jungle where the students were sent.</P>
<P>     This sets the doctor off on an allegorical journey, both to solve
the mystery and to seek his legacy.  Although sad, this poignantly
moving tale is never less than engrossing, not so much as a big mystery
but in its almost spiritual exploration along the way.</P>
<P>     Federico Luppi gives an impressive portrayal of Dr. Fuentes.  With
his highly polished look, he brings a commanding presence to the role.
And when the entire world as he thought he knew it begins imploding on
him, his fear and concern are never less than completely believable.  A
strong man, but a vulnerable one, the doctor faces a crisis of such
proportions he could never have dreamt of them in his worst nightmares.</P>
<P>     The word village does not adequately capture the spirit of these
obscure clusters of poor people living in the wilderness.  Many of the
places where they live can only be reached on foot, they are so far
removed from civilization.  At the first of this little hamlets, Dr.
Fuentes first learns of the murder of one of his students.  A poor
blind woman explains that the "Men with Guns" killed him.  Why?
"Because they had guns, and we didn't."  And in a story that takes no
political sides, the doctor comes to learn of atrocities committed by
the military, staffed by Indians from other villages, and the guerillas
alike.</P>
<P>     On his journey through more and more remote terrain, the doctor is
robbed repeatedly but picks up three unlikely traveling companions
along the way.  In a powerful performance rivaling Luppi's, Damian
Delgado plays a soldier named Domingo, who has gone AWOL from the army
since he became sick of being forced to perform unspeakable acts of
horror.  Domingo is no saint himself as his actions as well as the
scenes in flashback demonstrate, and one could argue that his quest is
for the redemption of his soul.</P>
<P>     As the boy Conejo, Dan Rivera Gonzalez delivers a performance so
natural that it sometimes seems he isn't acting at all.  Finally, the
most troubled person in the movie is a man who refers to himself as a
ghost, a priest named Damian Alcazar, who feels he is no longer a
priest.</P>
<P>     As the four travel through the wilderness, trying to avoid the Men
with Guns at every turn but usually failing, they become increasingly
frightened but resolved to carry on.  Along the way they come upon the
home in ruins of people known only as the Banana People, the Coffee
People and the Salt People, named for the single commodity they can
harvest to sell for food.</P>
<P>     (In a blessed relief from the show's tension, Mandy Patinkin and
Kathryn Grody play American tourists with laughably bad Spanish, who
have a blast touring the local ruins during all of this commotion.
Never realizing what is happening, they sum up their feelings to Dr.
Fuentes, whom they keep running into, as "It is 'so' peaceful here.")</P>
<P>     Typical of the locals the doctor meets along the way is a man
getting a haircut.  He sums up the situation succinctly as, "Nobody
refuses the men with guns."</P>
<P>     MEN WITH GUNS runs 2:08.  It is rated R for language and some
violent images and would be an excellent choice for teenagers as well
as adults.</P>
