<P>     I'll give this to Paul Thomas Anderson:  he's got a sense of
atmosphere.  HARD EIGHT, Anderson's feature writing and directing debut,
may be even more successful than LEAVING LAS VEGAS at making casinos look
ugly, and his characters exchange dialogue as though every word had to be
yanked out of them with pliers.  That's the good news.  The bad news is
that HARD EIGHT is yet another frustrating independent film by a rookie
film-maker who has an idea of what his film should be _like_ without
having an idea of what it should be _about_.  Though generally well-acted
and interesting to look at, HARD EIGHT is more a collection of thematic
ideas than a story.</P>
<P>      HARD EIGHT opens with an encounter between two men at a roadside
diner somewhere in the American West.  John Finnegan (John C. Reilly) is
down on his luck after a failed attempt to win the money for his mother's
funeral playing blackjack; Sidney (Philip Baker Hall) is a solemn older
man who seems interested in helping John out.  A veteran gambler, Sidney
offers to drive John to Las Vegas and teach him a few tricks of the trade.
Though suspicious at first, John accepts Sidney's offer, and soon learns
that his methods work.  Two years later, the two are still friends and
companions now working the casinos of Reno.  There John gets involved with
a young cocktail waitress named Clementine (Gwyneth Paltrow), an
involvement which soon turns into trouble.  As Sidney tries to help John
out of his predicament, he finds himself in a predicament of his own when
a man named Jimmy (Samuel L. Jackson) reveals that he knows some dark
secrets from Sidney's past.</P>
<P>     An extended sequence during the first half hour of HARD EIGHT might
lead you to believe that the film is going to be a revelatory study of the
gambling culture.  On the evening of the day they first meet, Sidney
teaches John how to fool a casino into believing he had gambled thousands
of dollars, prompting offers of a free room and other perqs from the floor
manager.  It is an interesting lesson in deception -- as is a later
instruction on how to steal pay-per-view movies which could send hotels
all across America scrambling to cover themselves -- which gives HARD EIGHT
a welcome sense of authenticity.</P>
<P>     That sociological curiosity factor isn't enough to sustain a film,
though, and sooner or later Anderson has to get down to the business of
examining the relationships between these characters.  At least he should
have, but he never does.  We see far too little of Sidney and John
together to get a sense of their friendship, making the significant
revelations to come ring totally false.  Philip Baker Hall, the
too-little-seen actor who was so masterful as Nixon in Robert Altman's
1984 SECRET HONOR, gives an impressive, controlled performance as the
Weary Sidney, but Anderson doesn't seem to know what to do with him.  We
get a chance to see him in a variety of situations -- playing the big shot
at a craps table, cleaning up after John's messes, showing kindness to
waitress/hooker Clementine (a thanklessly unpleasant role for Paltrow) --
without really giving us a sense of who he is, as though Anderson thinks
teasing us with a dark past is sufficient.  It's not.  Every once in a
while, HARD EIGHT breaks out of its languid stupor long enough for some
gratuitous violence, a half-hearted attempt at fooling the audience into
thinking something is happening.  Every time, it doesn't take long for the
film to settle back into a bleak somnambulism.</P>
<P>     The only time HARD EIGHT really wakes up is when Samuel L. Jackson
turns up in two scenes, once to be crude and once to be nasty.  Jackson's
profanity-laced tirades are entertaining to a point, but it soon becomes
clear that he's merely recycling riffs from PULP FICTION's Jules because
there isn't anything here on which he can base a unique character.  He's
not really a character at all here; he's a plot device, someone who turns
up when it's necessary for something to happen.  A number of things happen
in HARD EIGHT, but none of it adds up to a narrative we should care about.
If Anderson is trying to tell a tragic tale of a man's misguided attempts
at redemption, he doesn't succeed because he has forgotten to give us
enough information about Sidney to make his fate matter.  HARD EIGHT is
evocative but thoroughly unsatisfying, a film in which an oppressive
atmosphere of foreboding is the real central character, crushing the human
characters like empty beer cans.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 fumbling dice:  4.</PRE>
