<PRE>                            THE USUAL SUSPECTS
                       A film review by Andrew Hicks
                Copyright 1996 Andrew Hicks / Fatboy Productions</PRE>
<PRE>***1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        No matter what you suspect, this isn't your usual action 
thriller. THE USUAL SUSPECTS is an intelligent crime mystery story 
from up-and-coming director Bryan Singer. It's one of those movies 
that, after everything is revealed rapid-fire at the end, you immediately 
want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new 
light. Plot twists a-go-go are what you get here -- I gave up trying to 
figure out the mystery of Keyser Soze after awhile and just sat back 
and waited for them to reveal it to me.</P>
<P>        Keyser Soze is a name you'll hear at least a hundred times if 
you watch THE USUAL SUSPECTS and for good reason. It's not only 
the name of the mysterious (and possibly even mythical) crime boss in 
the movie, it also sums up the movie -- "Keyser Soze" in Latin means 
"an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director 
Bryan Singer." Or maybe I shouldn't have bought a foreign-language 
dictionary from the same company that makes those 99-cent 
encyclopedias sold in supermarkets.</P>
<P>        At the movie's opening, a group of known criminals are 
brought in for a police lineup, including McManus (Stephen Baldwin), 
Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Buckney (Kevin 
Pollack) and Verbal (Kevin Spacey, winner of the Best Supporting 
Actor Academy Award{SYMBOL 153 \f "Times New Roman" \s 10 \h} for his performance in the movie). Verbal is 
so-named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing. 
He also earns his name as the movie's narrator, spouting memorable 
lines like "The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the 
world he didn't exist" (although, obviously, he does exist -- What else 
could explain Kris Kross having a comeback in 1996?) while being 
interrogated by police detective Chazz Palminteri (any actor with 
multiple Z's in their name is okay in my book).</P>
<P>        We see the story unfold as Spacey retells it. The five felons, 
upon being released from the lineup, get their revenge on the police by 
exposing a corrupt taxi service -- whereby elite criminals pay to be 
smuggled through town in cop cars -- and stealing all the money and 
drugs in the car. It's a definite case of male bonding for the five 
criminals, who later find out they were brought together by the unseen 
Keyser Soze, who sends a minion to them with an offer they can't 
refuse. Namely, they have to destroy Soze's main competitors in 
organized crime by infiltrating a ship, shooting a bunch of people, 
burning all the drugs and stealing $91 million cash.</P>
<P>        Spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly 
unintelligent "cripple" character to life and Baldwin, Byrne, 
Palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast. THE USUAL 
SUSPECTS is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence 
and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense, 
keeping the viewer guessing until the very end -- and then still leaving 
a few details open for scrutiny and discussion. I suppose all that would 
be cleared up if I really had rewound the movie and watched it again 
instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the 
hell Kris Kross was doing on MTV. A different mystery, I guess, 
which may turn into a _murder_ mystery if that video ever comes on 
again...</P>
