<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A very entertaining Charlie Chan episode, though the way Charlie gets the killer
seems far-fetched and the killer's reason had to be explained by Charlie because
nothing in the film would indicate his reason. When Charlie shows up with his
family of 14 at the circus, it was a funny sight to take in. He's a guest of the
co-owner of the circus, Joe Kinney (Stanton). Kinney is worried because he's
been receiving threatening letters and wants to ask Charlie about them. They
plan to meet sometime during the show. </P>
<P>Charlie's 12 kids are awed by the dancing act of Tiny (Olive Brasno) and Tim
(George Brasno), they are the tiniest people in the world (in real-life they are
brother-and-sister 
midget performers). Number one son, Lee (Luke), is romantically inclined to the
show's contortionist, Su Toy (Shia Jung), but she's giving him the runaround. </P>
<P>When Charlie goes to meet Kinney at his wagon, he finds it locked. The co-owner
Gaines (Ford) can't open the door with his key since it's bolted from the
inside, but when they enter through the vent they find the dead body of the
strangled Kinney. All the evidence points to the dangerous ape, who someone let
out of the cage with a lost key, as being the killer. </P>
<P>Kinney made many enemies, therefore there are many suspects. Gaines, even though
everyone in the circus likes him, is the prime suspect because he may not be
able to pay the notes he owes Kinney at the end of the season and will therefore
lose the circus he loves. Hal Blake (McGuire), the animal trainer, is a suspect
because he hates Kinney when he sees him whip the ape and doesn't know how to
treat circus people. He wants to quit and asks Louise Norman (Shirley Deane) to
leave the circus with him. Lou's sister Marie Norman (Maxine Reiner), a trapeze
artist, wants to marry Kinney, while Nellie Farrell (Drew Leyton), the circus
dresser, looks to her scam artist brother Dan Farrell (Boothe Howard) for help
about handling her problem with Kinney. She has a marriage certificate saying
she was married to him 5 months ago and will use that to claim a partnership in
the circus. Holt (J. Carrol Naish-portrayed Charlie Chan on a late-1950s TV
series) is the surly snake-tamer, who says someone's trying to pin the blame on
him when a deadly snake is found in Charlie's train compartment. The circus is
on the train to go perform in the next town, as the police are also aboard to
wrap up the case. </P>
<P>The small-town cop, Lieutenant Macy (Wade Boteler), is handling the case, but
receiving limited help from Lee, who thinks he's a chip off the old block; but,
from Charlie, he's watching a master detective operate. </P>
<P>Charlie's best quote: "Mind like parachute - only function when open." </P>
<P>This film had a good circus atmosphere, lots of charm to it, and the suspects
did a good job of looking guilty. </P>
