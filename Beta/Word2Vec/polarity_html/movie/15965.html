<PRE>VELVET GOLDMINE (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Todd Haynes
Writer: Todd Haynes (story by James Lyons and Haynes)
Starring: Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Ewan McGregor, Toni Collette, Christian
Bale, Eddie Izzard, Emily Woof, Michael Feast</P>
<P>It may seem weird to begin a film about Glam Rock with a sequence that
includes a spaceship, a green ovular pin, and the birth of Oscar Wilde,
but if one really strains, they can see that perhaps maybe these
connections are not half off.  Wilde's philosophy was that everyone
should be true to their own human nature, and the result of his
following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned, loosing his family
and his career.  The Glam Rock movement in the early 70s in England had
a similar take and came to a similar demise.  The main difference was by
placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies
and inquiries about life (mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality),
they became less and less like themselves and more and more like
everyone else.  And that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it
began.</P>
<P>It's been said that Todd Haynes' "Velvet Goldmine," the film that
chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement, not only from
those who experienced it but by those who created it, steals a lot from
"Citizen Kane," and that's true.  In the film, a British journalist in
the 80s, Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), is asked to go back and find
out what happened to 70s Glam Rock star Brian Slade, a fictitious rock
star, who faked his own death on stage, bringing the end not only to his
career but to the entire Glam Rock movement.  Structure-wise, this
totally steals from "Kane," not only from the set-up (he interviews
three people, and the story is a result of their flashbacks), but in
other things, like the beginning (death, then newsreel), and smaller
details, like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter
ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer, found in a bar after hours.</P>
<P>This is no "Kane," and it really doesn't aspire to be: it doesn't
attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "Kane" did, and it
doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity.  Instead, it
uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the
Glam Rock era and the boredom that was life after Glam Rock for those
who were participants.  The 80s scenes are dry and deliriously
melancholy, equipped with a performance by Bale that is perhaps
appropriately dull and unengaging.</P>
<P>But the 70s scenes are engaging, though, not to mention addictively
campy.  They radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely
accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era, and a feel that's so
eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage, they
become not only a symbol of decadence, but of times when everything
seemed so simple.  Instead of creating the world the way it was, Haynes
paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale: the Glam
Rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after
you've experienced it, everything else seems so mundane.  There's no
outside world to speak of, secluding these people inside a protective
globe that will eventually crack.</P>
<P>Haynes focuses his story on the tale of Blade and the other fictitious
rock hero, Curt Wild, and their relationship that created, molded, and
then brought down the movement, reducing everyone else who contributed
to it as merely that - contributors.  Blade - played with reserve by the
pouty Jonathan Rhys Meyers - and Wild - played with anarchic wildness by
Ewan McGregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of
David Bowie and Iggy Pop, respectively, complete with the creation of a
Ziggy Stardust persona named Maxwell Demon and the confirmation that the
two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners
in music, but also partners in bed.</P>
<P>Through discussions with Slade's ex-manager Cecil (Michael Feast),
ex-wife Mandy (Toni Collette, reinventing herself as an American blonde
dish who fakes a British accent when with Slade), and finally ex-partner
Wild, journalist Stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the
era, like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity, including
the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality (when he opens up
his first Slade record, he finds a naked and green Slade lying on a
crimson blanket), and finally running away from home to be part of the
London scene, finally resulting in leading a boring job in America.</P>
<P>Haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur, molding scenes
that are like long heald breaths, such as a seemingly long sequence
juxtaposing a Slade/Wild concert of them performing a Brian Eno cover,
"Baby's on Fire," with scenes from a decadent drug party; and the film's
most wow-inspiring sequence, the first concert scene of Wild with his
band, the Ratttz, where McGregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that
his wild Iggy-esuqe movements (including stripping naked) and screams
that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major
talent, and another (Slade) discovers his idle.  Even the brief music
videos, spoofs of Bowie's, have a rare visual flair that's pure camp,
and which would cause Ken Russell to drool.</P>
<P>The best sequence, though, may be the beginning, following the prelude,
a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of
the movement and the post-movement era.  In it, Stuart and his mates are
going to the infamous Slade concert where he fakes his own death, where
he kills off his alter ego Maxwell Demon in what appears to be a real
assasination, which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake
bullet.  With Brian Eno's famous "Needle in the Camel's Eye" playing in
the background, the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn't
seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are.  It has a
distance that's hard to put a finger on, and it seems to represent that
all this is coming to a quick and sad ending, and when one sees Slade in
the dressing room before the show, docked in a silver frock with wings
and blue hair, depressingly staring into the mirror, it comes off as a
none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film.</P>
<P>This movie's not so much about plot, but more about the way it is
presented, making this one of those films which is classified as being
"style over substance," a statement which prompts many critics to line
up for attack.  However, for the most part, the engaging part of this
film is not the story but rather the way in which Haynes creates this
world, by using his sets, costumes, cinematography, and especially the
music to play as characters in his film.  The music is especially
notable.  The soundtrack, which is wall to wall, consists of old school
Glam Rock tunes by the likes of Brian Eno, T-Rex, and Roxy Music, as
well as covers by Slade's band (with vocals by Thom Yorke, and
occasionally Rhys Meyers himself), and even newer music by Shudder to
Think that sounds uncannily Bowie-like.</P>
<P>The cast is rather impressive, but no one really walks away with the
film, and no performances are extremely good.  Although Eddie Izzard, as
Slade's manager (who challenges Slade's first manager to an
arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career) and Michael
Feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly, and Collette and
McGregor have their moments, Rhys Meyers and Bale are noticably sub-par,
neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles.  Some of it
is at fault with the actual construction of the film by Haynes.  Rhys
Meyers' Brian Slade remains merely a metaphor for the Glam Rock era,
dying when he turned into a retro-Garbo, resorting to a life of
Salinger-ism, and found in the mid-70s to be lying around, sniffing coke
off the ass of a party girl.  In fact, no one in this film is really
seen as a person, rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type
who thrived during the era.  Bale's character is an especially tough
sell: bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood, he's
not an extremely personal character, and his cliched experiences (being
hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a
"poof") never help us communicate with him.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, Rhys Meyers and McGregor have the excuses that their
characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era
that has left them, and others, bitter, part of which helps the film
work, since this is a major piece of eye candy.  At the prime of the
movie, they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - Slade with
his perpetually-changing, androgonys persona, and Wild with his topless
and unpredictable image, which clash and fuse into an unstable union.
Their story - of how Slade was so influenced by Wild that he adapted it
into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging,
without the personal background.  The story of Stuart, though, is a
tougher sell because he's the everyman, and when you can't totally
identify with the everyman, your story's in slight trouble.</P>
<P>As a cultural rock piece, "Velvet Goldmine" is rather good, but it is
merely good.  It never totally takes off, although it has moments where
it absolutely flies, but then comes back down.  It's really nothing more
than a bunch of really great moments, surrounded by material that could
really be much better.  The beginning is captivating but slow, the
middle is fantastic, and the ending is not only shallow but worse than
that, it drags (the final half hour not only does it not bring the story
to any real conclusion, it could probably stop at any point).  And did
anyone really figure out what the mystery is that Arthur unearths?  It
almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other
than to unearth the past, which is commendable but not totally so.</P>
<P>Still, it does what the Oliver Stone pic "The Doors" didn't do right,
becoming very insightful to what happened, using the visual style to hit
most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great
to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era
that everything else seems half-assed (I suppose the message is: "Live
life, but after you've lived it, what else is the point when you'll be
forced to live with regretful memories?").  The really superb
achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks, it successfully
creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era,
but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
