<PRE>CRASH (1996)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: David Cronenberg
Writer: David Cronenberg (from the novel by J.G. Ballard)
Starring: James Spader, Deborah Kara Ungar, Holly Hunter, Elias Kosteas,
Rosanna Arquette, Peter MacNeill, Yolande Julian, Cheryl Swarts, Alice
Poon</P>
<P>I'm not really sure what to think about "Crash."  On the surface, it's a
cold, boring, unerotic porn with name starts, a name director, and some
cool camerawork.  I mean, it left me completely bored, unsatisfied, and
generally kinda weirded out.  But then again, not every film's supposed
to leave you entertained.</P>
<P>"Crash" is structured to play like a porn flick, but with significantly
more plot and dialogue.  While we see several extremely taboo scenes of
weirdo sex, we also have a skimpy little plot going on (mostly towards
the beginning), and maybe just a hair of characterization.  Not to
mention the acting is generally pretty good, and we don't really see a
lot of the actors completely exposed.</P>
<P>But what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this
is not an erotic experience.  This film does not posess the erotic
hypnotism of "Henry and June" or the just plain horniness of, say, "Deep
Throat" (not that I've seen it).  If one was to be made completely hot
by this film, it would probably mean they were also into the whole "auto
eroticism" thing.  The film leaves you cold erotically (and maybe in
many other ways), but what it does is present a group of people who live
on the edge.</P>
<P>The film opens up on a woman, Catherine (Deborah Kara Ungar, of "The
Game"), pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air
hangar.  Suddenly, a man enters the frame and begins to take her from
behind (the film doesnt' show all this though, even if it is NC-17). 
The next scene has a film director, James (James Spader), having sex
with a camera woman (Alice Poon) in an office on the highly-populated
set of his movie.  The next scene has the two coming together, revealing
to us that they're husband and wife, and them sharing in one another's
escapades.  While the two are arguably freaky people, we at least know
they love to live on the edge.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards, James is driving down the road at night, reclessly of
course (he's reading something), when he drifts into the other lane, and
then hits another car face on.  James is not killed, but the passenger
in the other car flies into his seat (obviously dying), leaving the
driver, Helen Remington (Holly Hunter - in a porn?), also alive.  The
two go through therapy together, and when getting out, they run into
eachother again.  When James gives her a ride home, they almost get into
another accident, and immeadiately afterwards, they go to an unbusy
parking lot, and have a little quickie, as they were aroused by the
accident.</P>
<P>You wouldn't think there would be many people who shared this same kind
of fetish, but they run into a freaky guy named Vaughan (Elias Kosteas)
and his crutch-carrying girlfriend, Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette), who
are also into it.  Vaughan is into living on the edge as they are, but
he takes it to another level: he loves to recreate famous car crashes. 
In one scene, he and a friend, Colin Seagrave (Peter MacNeill) recreate
James Dean's car crash without any padding or safety belts, and suffer
some concussions, but nevertheless get a rush (and the attention of the
police).  Soon, these five are all having sex with one another, be it
straight, gay, or lesbian sex.</P>
<P>While this is admittingly all a bit comical (the film is almost like a
black comedy), the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people
who's main fetish is living on the edge.  I'm sure somewhere there are
people who get aroused by car accidents, but I personally don't see a
connection between car crashes and sex.  The main connection Cronenberg
shows us that both give a definite rush.  His car crash scenes are quick
and exciting mini-masterpieces: we're at first not sure if they'll take
place, but everytime it looks like it may occur, we gasp.  Then when it
happens, we hold our breath.  The same thing happens with sex, although
not in the same fashion.  These people are merely taking it to another
level.</P>
<P>The only problem with the film is that it's a tad redundant.  A normal
porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half.  This goes on for about
100 minutes, and it just seems a little too long.  The sex and car
crashes are far between one another, and the time between them are a tad
on the boring side.  There's no characterization, although it could
definitely be argued, that hey, it's a porn, and we're not here to
sympathize.  But still, they coulda cut it down a bit.</P>
<P>But the film is saved with its presentation, as well as some other
elements.  The atmosphere is very dark and forboding, creating a kind of
cool weird feeling.  And there are several scenes are just amazing.  One
scene has Catherine and James having sex, while she softly asks him
questions about being with a man, which sounds almost erotic the way she
says it.  A sequence involving one character's death is filled with all
the edgy disjointment that the film needs.  And the final shot is shot
perfectly, creating an image of a car crash, and a couple having sex in
front of it, despite the fact that she's wounded.</P>
<P>The acting is also pretty good, especially for what is almost a porn
(ousting Linda Lovelace as best actress in a porn).  While James Spader
is pretty boring (he's usually pretty intense), Deborah Kara Ungar is
amazing.  She speaks all her words in almost zombie-like hushes, and
when she's having sex, she has a blank look on her face, not showing the
viewer whether she's enjoying it or not.  In one scene, she actually
looks dead while someone is having sex with her.  Holly Hunter, who gets
extra credit just for appearing in something like this, is pretty good,
and so is Rosanna Arquette (who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her
role).</P>
<P>But the film is stolen by Elias Kosteas who plays his character so
intensely that he almost upstages everyone.  He often speaks as he is
out of breath, showing a definite affinity for his way of life.  He has
a great deal of energy in several scenes, especially one scene where
he's taking photographs of a picture, and a later scene where he's
getting a freaky tatoo.  He and Spader share sexual chemistry in several
scenes, foreshadowing a later scene.  Kosteas is a little known actor
(his biggest role was Casey Jones in "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"),
but here he shows a DeNiro-like presence, hinting that he's capable of
bigger roles.</P>
<P>While I hardly enjoyed "Crash," it's still a pretty intriguing portrayal
of a group of people who, if the exist, are some of the strangest and
most bizarre people in the world.  These people are able to share a rush
between two completely different entities, and the film, which doesn't
exactly pain them in a negative light, is sucessful in bringing them to
light, even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out. 
Despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent NC-17 rating
(there's also an R-rated version, but I wouldn't even go near that
thing), anyone looking for a quick turn-on should just rent a regular
porno.</P>
