<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   It's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film
   distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules
   in order to give the annual Disney animated feature juggernaut a wide
   berth.  THE LION KING had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross
   to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history,
   continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks ALADDIN and
   BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  Since then, though, Disney's animated features
   have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns, with
   POCAHONTAS, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, and this year's HERCULES
   successively proving less and less potent.  With the once
   seemingly-impregnable Disney stranglehold on the market share
   suddenly looking mighty vulnerable, and faced with their first
   serious competition in the animated film market from Fox's ANASTASIA,
   Disney has brought Xmas home early by dusting off the feature which
   sparked the modern revival of feature animation, THE LITTLE MERMAID.</P>
<P>   While the animation for the film is, as is typically the case for
   Disney films, unquestionably top-notch, the magic in THE LITTLE
   MERMAID is not its animation, but the wonderful innocence of its
   story and its rousingly superb music.  The film's storyline is
   fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man, father
   disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter, teen
   disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man --
   except in this case, the chaperone is a crab, the teen is a young
   mermaid, and the object of her desire is a human prince.  What makes
   THE LITTLE MERMAID so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the
   richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest
   simplicity of their emotions.  From the moment mermaid Ariel lays her
   eyes on Prince Eric, she's resolutely smitten, and she's such a pure
   and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart
   with her.  This simple but touching love story, coupled with a
   healthy dose of smart humour, makes THE LITTLE MERMAID a remarkably
   captivating picture.</P>
<P>   One of the interesting things about THE LITTLE MERMAID is something
   which now curiously dates it: the voices cast for its motley crew of
   characters.  This film was produced just before the distracting
   concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue, which started to a
   certain degree with BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and was irrevocably
   exacerbated by Robin Williams' much-heralded turn in ALADDIN; by the
   release of THE LION KING and henceforth, the majority of characters
   in the animated films were voiced by celebrities.  While it's
   understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or
   drawing power of Disney (say, BALTO's use of Kevin Bacon and Bridget
   Fonda, or even ANASTASIA's showcasing of Meg Ryan and John Cusack)
   would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their
   products, it's unfortunate that even Disney has embraced this policy.
   Do we really need to hear, say, Demi Moore as Esmerelda in THE
   HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME?  Is the film's entertainment value really
   augmented by hearing a recognizable voice, rather than a voice which
   best suits the role?  (I'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for
   Eddie Murphy in the upcoming MULAN.)</P>
<P>   Fortunately, the performers who voice the characters in THE LITTLE
   MERMAID, although perhaps more obscure, are impeccably cast.  Chief
   among them is Jodi Benson, a 1992 Tony nominee for her stage work in
   CRAZY FOR YOU, who voices the film's heroine Ariel to perfection;
   with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor,
   and gorgeous singing voice, Ms. Benson provides a most engaging
   anchor for the film.  (She's the only reason I'd even consider
   catching FLUBBER.)  Similarly, Samuel E. Wright is terrific in the
   showy role of Sebastian, the weary guardian crab.  He easily milks
   his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth, and his
   rendering of two of THE LITTLE MERMAID's big tunes -- "Under The Sea"
   and "Kiss The Girl" -- have become the stuff of legend.  Pat Carrol
   is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch Ursula,
   while Kenneth Mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate
   authority of Ariel's father, King Triton.  In large roles and small
   (Edie McClurg as dotting busybody Carlotta is ideal, and Rene
   Auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant French chef), THE LITTLE
   MERMAID is impeccably cast.</P>
<P>   Of course, THE LITTLE MERMAID will probably be best remembered for
   its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team
   of Alan Menken (music) and Howard Ashman (lyrics), who had created
   LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and would go on to compose BEAUTY AND THE
   BEAST and ALADDIN for Disney before Mr. Ashman's untimely death.  Not
   only are Mr. Menken's tunes unbearably catchy, but Mr. Ashman's
   charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so
   that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue,
   and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film.
   Mr. Menken's score for the film is equally top-notch; the sequence
   where Eric (voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes) and Ariel tour his
   kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with
   Mr. Menken's fine score.</P>
<P>   It appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful
   production number for the calypso-styled "Under The Sea" as joyfully
   crooned by Mr. Wright, which won the Academy Award and Golden Globe
   Awards for Best Song -- indeed, one of the many little joys in
   screening the film during its re-release was listening to children
   scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but
   my favourite is Ms. Benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad "Part
   Of Your World", an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope
   (wonderfully lyricized by Mr. Ashman) which, accompanied by the
   film's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence, packs an
   emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes.  During
   the song's reprise, which builds to a crescendo with Ariel arching on
   a rock as a wave crashes in, the cumulative effect is nothing short
   of breathtaking, and one becomes acutely aware that this single
   instance is one of the finest in animation history.</P>
<P>   As of this writing, November 1997 has come to an end, as has Disney's
   limited 17-day re-release of THE LITTLE MERMAID.  There's no question
   that the primary motivation for, if not the film's reissue itself, at
   least its timing, was to reinforce Disney's dominance in the
   animation market and provide direct competition to Fox's costly new
   upstart animation division and their first major venture, ANASTASIA.
   In every respect, the re-release of THE LITTLE MERMAID appears to be
   a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative
   domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark; THE LITTLE MERMAID
   proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially
   released only eight years ago and in many homes on video, pulling in
   close to $10 million in its opening weekend; and although nobody
   could possibly expect THE LITTLE MERMAID to possibly defeat the
   aggressively-marketed ANASTASIA in head-to-head competition, it
   siphoned enough from the Fox film's opening weekend totals to keep
   ANASTASIA from the coveted weekend leader spot, allowing for Disney's
   odious FLUBBER to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the
   family demographic market share away.</P>
<P>   But although Disney's motives in the reissue of THE LITTLE MERMAID
   were self-serving and protectionist, the real winner is the public.
   Any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one, and
   it's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver
   screen.  THE LITTLE MERMAID is the best film to come out of the
   Disney's modern animation renaissance, and one of the greatest
   animated films ever made.</P>
