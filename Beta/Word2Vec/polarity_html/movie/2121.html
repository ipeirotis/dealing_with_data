<P>     In the run-down projects of Dublin lives Papa Riley (Gabriel
Byrne), a widower, and his two young sons, Ossie (Ciaran Fitzgerald)
and Tito (Ruaidhri Conroy).  Their life is pretty bleak until the
arrival of the boys' grandfather (David Kelly) with a glorious white
stallion by the name of Tir na nOg, a figure out of Irish legends, who
takes an instant liking to Ossie and Tito.  Events conspire, however,
to separate the horse from the children, as he is impounded by corrupt
police officers and sold to a wealthy businessman.  Never fear,
though--Ossie and Tito to the rescue.  They steal back Tir na nOg and,
with father and police in pursuit, head westward.</P>
<P>     INTO THE WEST is probably the first-ever Western to take place in
Ireland.  Actually, it isn't a Western per se, but more of a modern-day
fairy tale.  Certainly, a great deal of what happens is beyond the
realm of reality and requires a willing suspension of disbelief.
Director Mike Newell perhaps put it best when he said, "There are
certain things that happen in the film that cannot happen unless the
world is a very odd, mysterious, and unreal sort of place."</P>
<P>     Gabriel Byrne, in a fine performance as a grief-embittered
widower, plays a member of a gypsy-like group of nomads called the
travelers.  In 1985, with the death of his wife Mary in childbirth, he
rejected the band and headed for the civilized world, where he ended up
eking out an existence and spending far too much time in Dublin's
bars.  While much of INTO THE WEST focuses on the adventures of the
children, Papa Riley's redemption is not ignored.</P>
<P>     In typical fairy tale fashion, there's a clear delineation between
who the audience is supposed to sympathize with and who they aren't.
At the end, the good guys are rewarded and the bad guys get their
comeuppance, so those who don't like happy endings might be galled by
INTO THE WEST's final moments.  Then again,  Newell isn't known for
doing downbeat projects.</P>
<P>     The juxtaposition of reality and fantasy somehow doesn't gel
perfectly.  The blending of the two is not seamless, and this sometimes
makes the story's progression feel forced and unnatural.  Also, for
most of the movie, I was wondering if there was a point to all of
this.  Ultimately, there is--and a very telling one at that--but you
have to wait the entire picture to discover it.</P>
<P>     The two young actors who play Tito and Ossie are excellent with
expressions and actions, but young Ciaran Fitzgerald has trouble
delivering believable dialogue.  Occasionally, his lines seem stilted
and learned, rather than spontaneous.</P>
<P>     There are a couple of highly-memorable scenes in INTO THE WEST,
the best of which involve Tir na nOg in unusual surroundings.  Seeing
the horse prance around the inner corridors and elevator of the
high-rise building where the children live is highly entertaining, but
not nearly as much as watching him in a movie theater while his two
young friends enjoy BACK TO THE FUTURE 3.</P>
<P>     INTO THE WEST has its heart in the right place, even if frequently
defies logic.  The movie is not nearly as endearing as Newell's
previous film, ENCHANTED APRIL, nor is it as poignant as screenwriter
Jim Sheridan's MY LEFT FOOT, but it has its moments, and is definitely
suitable for all but the youngest of children.  Like THE SECRET GARDEN,
it has moments to captivate adults as well, even if it lacks some of
the emotional depth and serene beauty of that film.  This is a nice
family adventure--certainly not a great movie, but a solid one.</P>
