                                MANDELA
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     Having an extremely famous and revered subject who is willing to
grant you extensive interviews can sometimes be a mixed blessing for
filmmakers.  First-time feature length documentarians Angus Gibson and
Jo Menell received such an opportunity to speak with Nelson Mandela.
The resulting film, MANDELA, is all too reverential and slow paced.</P>
<P>     The heart of the film is a long interview with Mandela.  A talking
head can become monotonous, so editor Andy Keir cuts to some old film
footage to illustrate some of the points Mandela makes.  These clips
are almost all teasers.  Just when they start to get interesting, we
return to the talking head.</P>
<P>     The success of good documentarians is based mainly on the probing
nature of their (usually offscreen and unheard) questions and on how
resourceful they are in gathering exciting archival materials.  Gibson
and Menell do not seem particularly adept at either.</P>
<P>     There are few opposing points of view in the picture, and the
questions are all softballs for Mandela.  The film makes his life seem
too easy and preordained.  The ANC fights with other black
organizations, and Nelson's disagreements with Winnie over a host of
issues are barely mentioned.  The film's approach glosses over troubles
with the result that Mandela's rise to power appears all too simple.</P>
<P>     The autobiographical film starts with Mandela talking about the
history of South Africa.  The early settlers, the black Africans, moved
south into what is now South Africa over a thousand years ago.  In a
parallel to the American colonization, the Europeans arrived in the
middle of the seventeenth century and promptly seized the lands from
the current inhabitants.</P>
<P>     Mandela, we are told, is of "royal blood," and he speaks glowingly
of his family and his people's lands.  Dewald Aukema and Peter
Tischhauser's cinematography of rich golds and browns illustrate the
beauty of the land of which Mandela is so justifiably proud.</P>
<P>     In a slow show with little contrast or tension, there is a brief
excerpt of a speech by then South African President P. W. Botha.  "I've
been lenient and patient," he warns the ANC.  "Don't push us too far!
Don't push us too far!"  The ludicrousness of his speech makes a good
counterpoint to Mandela, but it is one of the few pieces of heightened
emotions in the movie.</P>
<P>     MANDELA was one of the 1996 nominees for an Academy Award for best
documentary.  An infinitely better picture was the winner, Leon Gast's
WHEN WE WERE KINGS about Muhammed Ali, which shows how powerful and
riveting a documentary can be.  MANDELA starts with a great man, but
its timid approach makes for a rarely compelling film.  It is a shame
that the Academy, year in and year out, ignores so many brilliant
documentaries (HOOP DREAMS and PARADISE LOST: THE CHILD MURDERS AT
ROBIN HOOD HILLS to name just a couple) while nominating high-minded,
but bland ones like MANDELA.</P>
<P>     MANDELA runs 1:57.  It is rated PG for images of violence, brief
nudity and some profanity.  The show would be fine for kids around nine
and up.  MANDELA drags too much for me to be able to recommend it, but
it does have its moments.  I give it **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
