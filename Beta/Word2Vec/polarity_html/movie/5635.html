<P>     "Stonewall" was an important name in both the American Civil War 
and the American gay civil rights movement.  While, for the former, it 
was a person (General "Stonewall" Jackson), for the latter, it was a 
place (New York's Stonewall Inn).  STONEWALL, the final feature film 
from British director Nigel Finch (who died of AIDS-related 
complications while editing the picture), deals with the place, not the 
person.  Using fictional characters but real events, this movie takes 
its audience back to the summer of 1969 and the events leading up to 
July 27th's "Stonewall Riots", when a group of drag queens fought back 
against police brutality.</P>
<P>     From the beginning, it's clear that STONEWALL is different from its 
more traditional, straight counterparts (films dealing with the black 
civil rights movement, for example).  While the movie explores serious 
issues, it often does so in a playful, even comic, manner.  There's a 
Greek Chorus of drag queens on hand to lip-synch old pop tunes that fit 
the current mood (some of these numbers recall similar moments from THE 
ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT).  The script is peppered 
with biting one-liners and amusing anecdotes.  Depicted from another 
point-of-view, STONEWALL could have been a real downer.  As it stands, 
however, Finch has made this an upbeat, triumphant tale.</P>
<P>     The focal point of STONEWALL is a tender love story between a small 
town hick named Matty Dean (Fred Weller) and a drag queen who goes by 
the name of La Miranda (Guillermo Diaz).  La Miranda is typical of the 
New York transvestite scene -- tough, hardened, and jaded.  By her own 
admission, she believes she's lost the capacity to feel anger or love.  
Matty has fled the homophobic backwaters of Hicksville to find that 
things aren't that much different in the Big City.  Homosexuality is 
still illegal, people can be arrested for dressing "contrary to their 
gender", and engaging in sexual activity with a member of the same sex 
is regarded as either an illness or a condition of sexual deviancy.</P>
<P>     Matty and La Miranda fall in love, but complications arise when one 
of Matty's compatriots in a pro-gay rights protest group, Ethan (Brendan 
Corbalis), wants to start a relationship.  Ethan's apparent passion for 
the movement inspires and entices Matty, and La Miranda's burst of 
jealousy pushes his new lover further away.  Meanwhile, as STONEWALL 
tracks this triangle, it also tells (in a somewhat abbreviated fashion) 
the story of another drag queen, Bostonia (Duane Boutte), and his 
conflicted, tough guy boyfriend, Vinnie (Bruce MacVittie), the owner of 
the Stonewall Inn.</P>
<P>     Certainly, the most fascinating aspect of STONEWALL is its 
depiction of the gay culture thirty years ago.  As homophobic as this 
nation is today, '90s views are nothing compared to those prevalent in 
the late-'60s.  The Stonewall Riots were the watershed.  Before that, 
gay America was afraid.  Their credo was "If we bleed, we do not win." 
In a July 4 demonstration at Philadelphia's Independence Hall, the 
activists dressed conservatively and lobbied for tolerance.  They 
willingly fostered the belief that homosexuality was an illness, 
courting pity in the hope that it would supplant hatred.  However, after 
Stonewall, empowerment replaced submissiveness.  The "freaks" and 
"deviants" took a stand, and soon gay rights' legislation was crawling 
across the country.</P>
<P>     STONEWALL is not intended to be a history lesson; the time frame 
and setting are necessary to the story, but they are subordinate to the 
characters.  Some of the subplots work; some don't.  Bostonia and 
Vinnie's relationship is incomplete, especially in the shadow of the far 
better-developed interaction between Matty and La Miranda.  The 
believability of these two anchors the film, preventing STONEWALL from 
ever becoming too outrageous or seeming too preachy.  We sympathize with 
the cause not because of rhetoric, but because we care about the 
characters.  Undoubtedly, that's one reason why this motion picture 
succeeds.  Another is that, in addition to having a heart, STONEWALL 
isn't afraid to have fun, which is a welcome change from the agenda of 
many grim, gay-themed motion pictures currently floating around the 
international film festival circuit.</P>
