                         The Leopard Son (1996)
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     THE LEOPARD SON is a G rated nature documentary movie produced by
The Discovery Channel and released to the theaters.  Think of it as a
live action BAMBI if you like.  The star of this film, however, is the
son of a leopard.</P>
<P>     The show starts with a few old black and white still photos of the
naturalist and filmmaker Hugo van Lawick, who was Jane Goodall's
husband.  THE LEOPARD SON is van Lawick's tale set in the Serengeti
plain of Africa and narrated by John Gielgud.  Van Lawick's star goes
from a young leopard cub, who spends all of his time frolicking while
his mother kills for him, to his trek across the plain as a full grown
leopard off to fend for himself.</P>
<P>     The show is full of the circle of life where animals eat other for
food, but it is rarely gory.  The food chain is treated in a natural
fashion, and my son Jeffrey (age 7 1/2) came away full of facts about
who can terrorize who in the animal kingdom.  Even his dad learned a
lot about the animal hierarchy that was not obvious.  I figured, for
example, that a leopard would scare off a baboon, but a leopard is no
match for a baboon's strong jaws.</P>
<P>     I was surprised at how dull the narration is.  Gielgud's usual
melodious voice seems tired and uninvolved.  The tone is pleasant
enough, but it lacks the necessary degree of warmth to make it
compelling.  The pedantic script could have learned a lot from THE
LIVING DESERT and the other Disney nature documentaries from the 50s.
They knew how to use a little humor to enliven the story.</P>
<P>     The script mainly tries to be a fact based autobiography, but
thankfully does have its more poetic moments.  The narrator says, "The
hyenas are used to the sounds of death and arise instantly with larceny
in their hearts."  Later he remarks about the animals, "It looks like a
game, but it's so much more.  It's about determination and
persistence."  When the leopard son learns of a tragedy in the family,
the narrator reflects, "some lessons are hard, others harder still."
"It is those left behind who suffer most."</P>
<P>     The scenery, especially of the large animal herds and of the
sunlight and the mist, is spectacular.  It never ceases to amaze me how
they can get so close even with telephoto lens to photograph animals in
the wild.  All of this notwithstanding, I was a bit disappointed by the
cinematography.  I thought the colors seemed washed out and overall, it
did not match in quality the images being captured.</P>
<P>     The editing seems sloppy as well.  Too often the editing consisted
of one long slow scene pasted to another with the effect being too
often tedious.  My son had his head on my shoulder quite a bit which he
only does when a slow begins to lose his interest.</P>
<P>     The film's sounds are quite effective with the low rumble of the
lions and the whinny roar of the young cheetahs being particularly
fascinating.  On the other hand, Stewart Copeland's music, which tries
to mimic African rhythms, left me cold.</P>
<P>     In a reflection partially on our culture and partially on some new
friends of his, my son told me that "the leopard son's dad was divorced
from his mom."  He reasoned this out since the dad was not in the show.
He never considered that the father might have died or that it was a
natural occurrence among animals.</P>
<P>     THE LEOPARD SON runs 1:25 but seems longer.  It is rated G.  Small
kids might be scared by a couple of the killing scenes, but I don't
think so since they are handled so carefully.  Will your kids like it?
I guess it depends if they like Discovery Channel sort of shows and if
they are patient.  This dad was frequently bored during the show.
Nevertheless, my son is a testament to the effect that the film has
appeal.  He loved it, gave it four thumbs up, and was full of little
animal anecdotes and facts after it was over.  I tried, but just can
not bring myself to recommend this picture no matter how well
intentioned.  I do give it a ** rating for some nice parts.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
