<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A minimal story that is too thin for a feature film. It is about urban
deterioration and alienation in Taiwan as seen just seven days before
2000 and leading up to the 'new millennium.' A nameless, boyish
appearing young man, dressed most of the time in his underwear, who runs
a vegetable market, Lee Kang-Sheng, lives in a dingy building that has
bad plumbing and lots of leaks. He lives above Yang Kuei-Mei, the
nameless woman, who is upset that there is a hole in her ceiling. It is
one that a plumber made and never returned to repair. The upstairs
neighbor now looks down at her as she prances around in her black slip
and he leeringly watches as her discomfort grows as conditions worsen.
We even get to watch her pee while she's on the cell phone. The hole
will become their means of getting to know each other, for better or
worse, as he comically tries to communicate with her by placing a black
umbrella in the hole.</P>
<P>A radio report mentions that the city water is contaminated and the
water supply will be cut off by the end of the week in the quarantined
sections. There's also a citywide garbage strike and a constant downpour
outside. To make matters even worst, there is a deadly Taiwan virus
going around caused by the cockroach. It makes one act like a bug,
crawling on all fours and so on, as the victim first shows flu-like
symptoms. These two tenants are living in the quarantined part of the
city because of the virus emergency and their only solace might be in
getting to know each other and offering comfort to one another, an
opportunity afforded by the hole, as their physical barrier that
separates them is removed.</P>
<P>At the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, this Taiwanese-French drama won a
Fipresci Award, given by international critics. What I liked best about
it were the half dozen musical numbers sung by Grace Chang, as the two
tenants lip-synch and dance along to the tunes. The film would be
interrupted by the fantasy scenes, where the dressed-up protagonists
would go into their lively cabaret-like song and dance routine. Some of
the lively songs to counter the non-action scenes were: 'Oh Calypso,'
'Go away don't come back,' 'I want you to-what I want is your love,'
'Gesundheit,' and 'I don't care who you are.'</P>
<P>This film was initiated as part of the French TV series of one-hour
end-of-millennium dramas. Its appeal will probably be most appreciated
by the music lovers of those old Hong Kong films (Grace Chang was a
popular singer in the China of the 1950s), and those admirers of French
directors Rivette and Demy, whose musicals are also followed by strange
stories and a dead-pan humor. It also should appeal to those who want to
see the unusual, and their reward might be that this is a film that
makes them think they have something to think about. For me, nothing
much happened in this intriguing Kafka-like idea for a film to rise
above its leaky promises. It needed more of a story and protagonists
with more personality, in order for it to feel more alive.</P>
