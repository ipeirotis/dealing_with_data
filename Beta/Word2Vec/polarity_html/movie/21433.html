                         YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
                        A movie review by Joe Barlow
                             (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>
<PRE>STARRING:   Jason Patric, Ben Stiller, Aaron Eckhart, Amy Brenneman,
               Catherine Keener, Nastassja Kinski
DIRECTOR:   Neil LaBute
WRITERS:    Neil LaBute
RATED:       R
RELEASED:   1998</PRE>
<PRE>                RATING: *** 1/2 (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
<P>        To call "Your Friends and Neighbors" a dark film is to call
The Beatles a moderately successful band.  This feature, the second
from writer/director Neil LaBute, continues his tradition of placing
despicable characters in unpleasant situations, a motif he introduced
with last year's "In the Company of Men."</P>
<P>        The story revolves around the lives of three couples
(identified in the film's end credits as Jerry, Cheri, Terri, Cary,
Barry and Mary, though their names are never spoken in the film).  All
six of our characters are unhappy with their love life, and several of
them decide to make a change... though none of them realize the others
are also miserable.  They don't know it at the time, but their actions
will actually leave them more unfulfilled than they were before.</P>
<P>        The casting is interesting.  Jason Patric, the villain from
"Speed 2," is the film's most loathesome character: a doctor who
practices "sex talk" when he's alone so he can sound sincere in bed.
He berates his lover for daring to have her period, fondly recalls
raping a high-school classmate, and absently plays "catch" with a
plastic fetus while talking on the phone, eventually drop-kicking it
down the hospital hallway.  (I was reminded of Ike from "South Park":
"Don't kick the baby!")</P>
<P>        Ben Stiller is a college professor whose relationship is on
the rocks because he likes to talk during sex, a quirk that his
girlfriend hates.  Her coldness doesn't bother him, though, since he's
got the hots for Amy Brenneman, a beautiful writer who's working on an
article about the art of lovemaking.  She's obviously attracted to Ben
as well, and all would be well if she didn't happen to be the wife of
his best friend.</P>
<P>        Aaron Eckhart, the most twisted person from "In the Company of
Men," is one of this film's most likeable characters.  He's the only
guy who doesn't really do anything wrong: he loves his wife and would
never dream of being unfaithful, although he is frustrated with her
conservative approach to sex.  He confesses to his friends that
although he adores her, she is unable to provide him with the kind of
pleasure he can achieve with his own hand.</P>
<P>        Stiller's girlfriend, played by Catherine Keener, meets
Nastassja Kinski, an assistant artist employed at a local gallery.
Their friendship quickly grows complicated, progressing from strangers
to buddies to lesbianism over the course of three scenes.  Kinski is
the closest thing to a voice of reason contained in the film: all five
of the other characters wander into the art gallery at some point and
engage in frightfully similar (and hilarious) conversations with her.
Along with Eckhart, Kinski is the only truly likeable character.
Sweet and loyal, she's determined to do everything she can to make her
new lesbian lover happy... to the point of smothering her with
kindness.</P>
<P>        That's our cast and storyline, and in case you missed it, I'll
reiterate: this is a BLEAK film.  It's a train-wreck: the sight is
horrible and appaling, but you can't turn away.  LaBute has crafted a
movie so shocking that it can't really qualify as entertainment;
however, the message is an important one.  If you've ever thought
about cheating on the one you love, I promise, this film will change
your mind.</P>
<P>        LaBute wants the audience to squirm, and he achieves his goal
by grabbing our noses and pulling us into his world.  We have no
distance from any of the characters; the film is shot almost entirely
with close-ups, a little touch that made me fidget uncomfortably in my
seat.  This, coupled with the fact that none of the characters' names
are given in the course of the story, provides an intimate yet
anonymous portrait of six lives on the fast track to disaster.</P>
<P>        I watched the "lesbian" portions of the film with some
amusement.  Since the release of "Chasing Amy," it seems that all
independent movies are required to include a character who suddenly
realizes that he or she is either gay or bisexual midway through the
show.  "Your Friends and Neighbors" does not disappoint in that
regard.  I'd criticize this trend a little more if my own indie
screenplay, "Four Sides of the Triangle," didn't have the exact same
problem.  Oops.</P>
<P>        I've awarded this film three and one-half stars, which is
surely the highest rating I've ever given to a movie that I did not
particularly enjoy.  But this is not a mistake: I don't think LaBute
intends for us to LIKE the film.  He wants to make us miserable,
and thereby warn us of the effects that cheating and dishonesty can
have on a relationship.  He accomplishes his goal: no one who sees
this movie will forget the lesson.  I truly believe that every person
in the world should watch "Your Friends and Neighbors" at least
once.  It would do much to solve society's marital problems.</P>
<P>        (Oh, one interesting thing I noticed.  In "There's Something
About Mary," Ben Stiller plays a really nice guy obsessed with a woman
named Mary.  In "Your Friends and Neighbors," Ben Stiller plays a
really creepy guy obsessed with a woman named Mary.  I've heard of
typecasting an actor, but this is ridiculous.)</P>
