<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is one of the dumbest films I have ever seen. Ed Wood Jr. doesn't
make them this horrid. It's a brutally dark tale of a sadistic drunkard
who mentally tortures his wife and eventually aims to kill her. Cult
film star Beverly Garland is the attractive Ellen Winslow married for
three years to oil executive husband Jerry (Skip Homeier), who lied to
her where he was born and raised. When she takes a job with Cliff Kane
(Ken Tobey) in order to pay the bills, the hubby who earns $20,000 a
year goes into a jealous snit. He slaps her, calls her a tramp, spills a
drink on her and tells her he wants a divorce.</P>
<P>She consults with her best friend Ruth (Hannah Stone), and tells her she
found out that Jerry is really from this redneck Oklahoma town called
Quehada and not from Pennsylvannia. Since Jerry disappeared, she goes to
find him in Quehada on a hunch that he's there; she wants to tell him
that his boss said if he doesn't show up on Monday, he's fired. She
looks up his best friend Harvey and is told by his wife, that her
husband is a good for nothing drunk and womanizer; she further says,
that if she catches him with another woman, she'll kill them both. When
she locates Harvey, she finds him to be a porcine, drunken slob who
tries to sexually force himself on her. He has taken her to the grave
where Jerry's hellion mother is buried and tells her she has the same
name as Jerry's mom; that he hated his mom so much, that when she died
he never came back. But he has guilt-feelings and has fresh flowers
delivered every month to her grave.</P>
<P>Jerry shows up in town steals her purse and convertible, and traps her
in town. She is spotted by Harvey, who in a drunken rage takes her to
the cemetery and brutally rapes her while Jerry watches from behind the
bushes.</P>
<P>When Ruth rescues her the next day, she returns to work for Cliff. Just
when their romance is becoming serious, she finds out that Cliff and
Jerry have a history together; that Jerry once took a job away from
Cliff. She now realizes that Jerry's anger with her was because Cliff
hired her to needle him. Going against the advice of Ruth, she meets
Jerry in a cheap motel to apologize to him. At the motel, she is
surprised when the perverted Jerry has Harvey there in his place. She
escapes another rape when Harvey's wife shows up, as Jerry called her
hoping she would kill her.</P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph.</P>
<P>Garland is one stupid lady in this film. It's hard to know what she
wants, she's so confused and laden with guilt. She invites Jerry over
again for one last chance, but he acts sadistic to her, but she's saved
by Cliff. When he asks her to marry him and go to Mexico City with him
where he is relocating his business, she says no. In the final scene,
she changes her mind and gets on the plane with him just as it is taking
off.</P>
<P>The two things that are positive about the film are: Beverly Garland is
a looker and the film is an oddity. But this film is only for Beverly
Garland fans, which I count myself as an unofficial member.</P>
