<P>     You'll be seeing ads for A PERFECT MURDER trumpeting "from the
director of THE FUGITIVE," which should set off a few alarms.  If you're
inclined to do the math, you'll note that THE FUGITIVE came out five years
ago, and you might reasonably wonder what Mr. Davis has been up to in the
interrim.  The answer is two films Warner Bros. is hoping everyone has
long forgotten:  the bloated, laughless caper comedy STEAL BIG, STEAL
LITTLE and the bloated, lifeless action film CHAIN REACTION.  Those films
too were advertised as "from the director of THE FUGITIVE," only the
director of THE FUGITIVE never showed up.  Could Davis finally display the
film-making skill which once held viewers on the edge of their seats, but
seems to have been in hibernation for half a decade?</P>
<P>     I'm pleased to note that Davis directs A PERFECT MURDER with much
more of the style and savvy which characterized THE FUGITIVE.  Too bad the
script is such a mess.  The film is based on Frederick Knott's play "Dial
M for Murder," previously made in 1954 by a fellow named Hitchcock.  This
version casts Michael Douglas as Steven Taylor, a wealthy New York
commodities broker with a lovely young wife named Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow).
Though she's a highly-educated diplomat with the United Nations, Emily is
treated like a trophy by Steven, leading her to seek fulfillment in an
affair with starving artist David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen).  Unfortunately,
Steven learns of the affair, and has the natural husband's reaction of
wanting to kill somebody.  His approach, however, is somewhat unusual:  he
offers David half a million dollars to kill Emily.</P>
<P>     Thus begin the expected twists, turns and double-deals, with the
three main characters regularly exchanging the upper hand.  All three
roles are well-cast and well-played -- Paltrow as the smart but vulnerable
ingenue, Mortensen as the sexy but dangerous "other man," and Douglas as
the calculating, morally shady businessman in the manner he should have a
patent on by now.  Douglas in particular gives the material a welcome
edge, pitching tart dialogue with a superior sneer and making it supremely
satisfying to watch his plans go awry.  Davis' production team, including
production designer Philip Rosenberg and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski,
creates an appropriately gothic atmosphere to complement tautly-directed
individual sequences.  All these elements are crafted by Davis into a
satisfying package likely to keep you intrigued as long as your watching.</P>
<P>     Watch out for the drive home, though, when the whole thing may fall
apart in your head so fast you'll lose sight of the road.  On the one
hand, A PERFECT MURDER contains as many metaphorically unfired guns as any
film in the history of post-Chekhovian drama.  Why doesn't it matter that
Emily is multi-lingual?  Why is one character left conspicuously
wounded-but-not-necessarily-dead, never to appear again?  Why does a
sharp-witted homicide detective (the talented David Suchet, in a magnetic
but under-used performance) play virtually no role in the investigation?
On the other hand, it underlines some of its key plot points so blatantly
(INSERT LINGERING CLOSE-UP OF MEAT THERMOMETER HERE) that it's more than
vaguely insulting, then drops key clues into the narrative from out of
nowhere.  Add to that a story which dumps intellectual gamesmanship for
struggles over a gun, and it's no wonder the film went back before the
cameras for 11th-hour re-shoots of its final scenes.  Writer Patrick Smith
Kelly makes a lot of changes from DIAL M FOR MURDER, but he doesn't make
much sense.</P>
<P>     I suppose it's a credit to how much Davis does right that A PERFECT
MURDER still pushes plenty of the right buttons until the anti-climactic
climax.  If a director is lucky, he gets a good script he can make even
better with stylistic choices.  On other occasions, the best he can do is
apply makeup to all the blemishes.  Between the film's mood and its solid
performances, A PERFECT MURDER is about as strong a film as you can make
from such feeble material.  It may not be redemption for "the director of
THE FUGITIVE," but it sure is a step in the right direction.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 murders he wrote:  5.</PRE>
