<P>     I wasn't sure I would be able to enjoy THE 6TH MAN as a wacky comedy,
given the uncomfortable familiarity of the plot.  In 1990, All-American
forward Hank Gathers of Loyola Marymount University died of a congenital
heart ailment in the middle of one of his team's final regular season
games, a tragedy which took on even more mythic proportions when his
under-manned team went on an improbable run through the NCAA championship
tournament before losing to eventual champion Nevada-Las Vegas.  Gathers'
death affected me as profoundly as any celebrity tragedy ever has, and I
cringed at the idea of that event being turned into a source of
supernatural hijinks.  Perhaps that's why I was so pleasantly surprised to
discover how much heart THE 6TH MAN turned out to have.  Though slapstick
is definitely part of the mix, there is a genuinely affecting human story
at the core of this film which outweighs its occasional clumsiness.</P>
<P>     THE 6TH MAN is the story of two brothers playing for the University
of Washington Huskies basketball team:  Antoine Tyler (Kadeem Hardison),
the team's senior leader and superstar, and Kenny Tyler (Marlon Wayans), a
junior who has lived his life in Antoine's shadow.  The Huskies are having
one of their best seasons in years, contending for the Pac-10
championship, when tragedy strikes.  In the middle of a key game, Antoine
suffers a heart attack and dies, leaving the team heart-broken and
disoriented.  No one is more heart-broken than Kenny, who asks his departed
brother for help when he struggles with the new leadership role asked of
him.  Much to his astonishment, he gets that help:  Antoine appears as a
ghost visible only to Kenny, offering to help the Kenny and the rest of
the team.  Thus begins a surge for the NCAA tournament when strange breaks
seem to be going the Huskies' way, drawing the attention of sports writer
R. C. St. John (Michael Michele).</P>
<P>     THE 6TH MAN is a fantasy of course, but close followers of Pac-10
basketball will appreciate that it's not just the presence of ghostly
activity which makes the film fantastic.  Not only are Washington and
Stanford in this film's Final Four, but dismissed head coaches Todd
Bozeman of California and Jim Harrick of UCLA are still sitting on their
respective teams' benches in game footage; if that doesn't qualify as
fantasy, I'm not sure what does.  THE 6TH MAN is certainly targeted at
college basketball fans given its release during Final Four weekend, but
the on-court action is often awkwardly photographed with too many
close-ups and choppy editing.  For a film about college basketball, THE
6TH MAN generally doesn't try very hard to re-create the fan excitement or
game situations of the sport.</P>
<P>     Of course, THE 6TH MAN isn't a documentary.  It's a comedy, and
occasionally it's a very funny one.  Marlon Wayans turns in an extremely
entertaining and energetic physical performance as Kenny, who has to do a
lot of solo acting as though he is being hassled by his invisible older
brother -- hugs, head-locks, wrestling matches and other practical jokes.
It's fun, if somewhat predictable stuff, mostly because Wayans is able to
sell it with enthusiasm.  He gets a bit of supporting help from Hardison
and from David Paymer (as the Huskies' coach), but with a cast composed
largely of former college basketball players (including Lorenzo Orr and
Travis Ford), Wayans has to carry the most of the humorous moments on his
shoulders.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, THE 6TH MAN is actually more enjoyable when it's not a
comedy.  Some of the character material is unnecessary -- notably the
attempt at a romantic relationship between Kenny and R. C. (yes, Michael
Michele is a woman) -- but the sibling story-line is extremely effective.
A short flashback opening shows Antoine and Kenny as kids on their
father's youth league team, setting up a relationship where Kenny always
depends on the more talented Antoine to hit the winning shot or make the
spectacular play.  When Kenny calls on Antoine for help, he believes he
doesn't have it in him to be a star, and having his ghostly brother around
gives him an excuse not to try.  It is only when Antoine begins to go a
bit too far on the court that Kenny decides to make an identity for
himself apart from being Antoine's brother.  One of the nicer touches in
THE 6TH MAN is that Antoine isn't made into an angel on the hardwood; he's
the same mildly obnoxious ball-hog in death that he was in life, a big
brother who thinks he always knows best.  The interaction between the two
brothers, squabbles and all, is what makes THE 6TH MAN more than the
formulaic Disney silliness you might expect.  In spite of some erratic
pacing and uneven comedy, THE 6TH MAN has the emotional content to give a
tragedy the weight it deserves, as well as the entertainment it needs.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 ghost offenses:  6.</PRE>
