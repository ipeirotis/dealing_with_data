AN AFFAIR OF LOVE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Titles for films serve a variety of purposes from grabbing the attention 
of potential viewers to giving them an expectation of what the movie 
will be like.  (Sometimes, of course, filmmakers confuse the public by 
devising ironic titles like HAPPINESS.)</P>
<P>The aptly named AN AFFAIR OF LOVE was originally called UNE LIAISON 
PORNOGRAPHIQUE (A PORNOGRAPHIC AFFAIR) when it was released in France.  
Both titles are true to the story, but A PORNOGRAPHIC AFFAIR is very 
misleading.  Those people who go expecting graphic sex will be quite 
disappointed, and those avoiding it because they think it is a porn 
movie will be deprived of seeing an extremely wise and interesting movie 
about adult relationships.  The story has more in common with MY DINNER 
WITH ANDRÉ than BASIC INSTINCT.</P>
<PRE>Let me explain.</PRE>
<P>The movie starts with an off-screen interviewer (Jacques Viala) talking 
independently with "him" (Sergi López) and "her" (Nathalie Baye) about 
the relationship that they once had with each other.  (The two lead 
characters are known only by pronouns.  We know that they are both 
single but know little more about them.)  They have slightly different 
memories of their affair's frequency and duration.  Although from the 
beginning we know the story's arc, writer Philippe Blasband finds 
involving and sometimes surprising ways to get there.  Blasband comes up 
with an especially satisfying way to cause the affair to begin to 
unravel.    </P>
<P>Their affair starts with her putting an ad in a sexual magazine for a 
man to have a purely physical affair, a.k.a., a pornographic affair, 
with her.  He answers the ad, and they go to a hotel room which she has 
booked in advance.  They both call what they have their "fantasy."  What 
exactly this constitutes we'll never know for we are mainly confined to 
hanging around the hallway with the maid after they lock themselves in 
their room.  This leaves us to concentrate on the non-sexual part of 
their union.</P>
<P>Both actors accomplish more with subtle facial movements than through 
their dialog.  Well cast, the two middle-age actors are reasonably 
attractive but neither is beautiful.  The chemistry between them, which 
we witness usually as they have drinks at a bar near the hotel, is more 
genuine that 20 such would-be romances in traditional Hollywood films.  
Their relationship moves from a business associate-like politeness to 
genuine love, but the road is anything but smooth, especially since they 
agree to divulge nothing of their private lives to each other, not even 
their names.  </P>
<P>One of the most satisfying parts of the film occurs when they finally 
let us into their bedroom to watch them engage in sex, albeit not their 
fantasy act.  Most cinematic sex has naked model-quality individuals 
engaging in something that approximates auditions for World Wrestling 
Federation membership.  In contrast, director Frédéric Fonteyne has his 
actors truly making love, not sport.  A minor quibble would be their 
constant use of sheets to cover themselves.  A little more openness 
would have been appropriate.</P>
<P>What exactly was this fantasy of theirs, the interviewer demands to 
know.  He will say nothing.  She will only say that "it was an act of 
love."  And love is precisely what AN AFFAIR OF LOVE is about -- as well 
as the importance of good human communication, friendship, intimacy and 
even marriage.  It's a wonderfully touching film with a big and slightly 
bittersweet heart.  </P>
<P>AN AFFAIR OF LOVE runs an amazingly fast 1:20.  The film is in French 
with English subtitles.  It is rated R for some strong sexual content 
and would be acceptable for older teenagers.  </P>
