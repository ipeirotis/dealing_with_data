<PRE>                                 SWINGERS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     First, let's do a destination check.  If you are looking for a sex
show, then you've got the wrong movie - SWINGERS isn't it.  Regardless
of the title, which actually has a triple meaning in the film, SWINGERS
is about a sweet character who broke up with his long time girlfriend
six months ago, but can't get over it.</P>
<P>     SWINGERS is a touching little film with an endearing performance
by Jon Favreau as unlucky-at-love Mike.  Favreau, with his strong chin
and long sad face that looks like a rock statue, has just the physique
to afford him the opportunity to play such roles for maximum empathy.
Although the other actors in the show are okay, only his acting is
compelling.  Favreau also wrote and co-produced SWINGERS.  Favreau's
script and Doug Liman's direction are what makes this little tale come
alive.</P>
<P>     "You have to put life into perspective.  She doesn't deserve you,"
says Mike's answer machine to him since his ex-girlfriend still hasn't
called him.  He has moved from the East Coast to LA and now hangs out
with new male buddies who are all trying to break into the
entertainment field.  He is a wannabe comic, but most of all he is a
wannabe boyfriend of somebody.</P>
<P>     Most of the film is about his trying unsuccessfully to establish a
relationship with someone of the opposite sex.  His buddies have a
plethora of advice, most about the correct time before calling back a
woman you have just met.  "Two days is like industry standard" advises
his male friend named Sue (Patrick Van Horn).  The proper interval is a
subject of much debate among his den of male companions, who approach
the topic with ferocity and precision.</P>
<P>     His male clique's pseudo-sophistication provides most of the
humor.  There are few guffaws, but lots of nice episodes worthy of many
a chuckle.  Trent (Vince Vaughn), who claims a long string of female
conquests, admits that he hasn't a clue as to what his girlfriends are
talking about and "all I do is stare at their mouths and wrinkle my
nose, and I turn out to be a sweetheart" to them.</P>
<P>     His friends' careers are going nowhere like his own.  When Rob
(Ron Livingston) doesn't get his sitcom part, he tries out for a job as
Goofy, but gets turned down because, "I didn't have any theme park
experience."</P>
<P>     The script is full of little quirky aspects.  My favorite is that
it reveals that all of the coolest bars in Hollywood are entered via
unmarked doors in alleyways.  Another nice touch is the way the guys go
places in solo car convoys that look for all intents and purposes like
a funeral procession.</P>
<P>     Poor Mike, when meets a group of women at a chic party in the
Hollywood Hills, he tries politeness with, "Hi, how are you ladies
doing this evening?"  The leader of the group immediately cuts him down
to size with the definitive question, "What do you drive?"</P>
<P>     Trent is full of advice for Mike on scoring with women.  When Mike
spots a prospect at a bar, Trent tells him, "I don't want you to be
like the guy in the PG-13 movie where everyone hopes its going to
happen.  I want you to be like the guy in the rated R movie."</P>
<P>     The script is full of references to past films.  When Sue uses a
gun to scare away some guys in a dark parking lot, Mike screams at him,
"Haven't you seen BOYZ N THE HOOD?  They are going to come back and
shoot us."</P>
<P>     The show has many well done small touches.  Mike's clothes by
Genevieve Tyrrell are carefully chosen examples of choices likely to
turn off potential female admirers.  Typical is the bad suit with the
Burgundy shirt and ugly tie that he uses to impress people in Vegas.</P>
<P>     Hang out with these guys for a while, and you may begin to feel
sorry for them.  They have lots of theories, but actually not a clue as
to how to relate to women.  Only Mike is a whole person, and we grow to
care about him thanks to Jon Favreau's sympathetic and heartfelt
performance.  The rest of the guys deserve their empty lives.</P>
<P>     SWINGERS runs a fast 1:35.  It is rated R solely for the language
which I thought fairly tame considering the subject matter.  There is
no violence, nudity, or sex although there are a lot of discussions
about sex.  The film would be fine for any teenager interested in the
film.  I had several good laughs and liked the show enough to recommend
it and give it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
