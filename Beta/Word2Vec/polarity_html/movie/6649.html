                       A film review by Mufti Splenetik
                        Copyright 1997 Flying Inkpot</PRE>
<PRE>Written by: Kevin Brodbin
Directed by: John Gray
Produced by: Seagal-Nasso
Cast: Steven Seagal (James Cole), Keenen Ivory Wayans (Jim Campbell).
Runtime: About 92 minutes
Rating : ** out of *****</PRE>
<P>I am a Steven Seagal fan. I only say this now because "Mufti Splenetik"
isn't my real name and because I probably need to explain why I went into
this film expecting great things.</P>
<P>Any proud Seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the Seagal formula
is something you can depend on. Seagal films can always be counted on for
minimal dialogue, heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable
bones (which we'll always hear when Seagal does his limb-twisting thing),
rarely a female co-lead in sight (unless it's a real-life model-wife who
hasn't worked since WEIRD SCIENCE) and, usually the worst possible titles
you can imagine. Not to mention very straightforward plots, generally
all-round bad dialogue and Mr Implacable Leather-Face himself in that same
black outfit he's been in since NICO doing his "my hands are sharp, nimble
knives" thing, Seagal the Stoic, Sir Petrified Ponytail, Duke of Dull.</P>
<P>In THE GLIMMER MAN, Seagal breaks out of this formula: he gets a *sidekick*,
attempts to banter, and puts on a new vest. He's also put on quite a lot of
weight. Small potatoes, you may say, a man should be able to accessorize
and banter if he wants to, but damnit, if it ain't broke, why fix it? (more
on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later).</P>
<P>As Jack Cole, Seagal is a homicide detective with a Questionable Past. While
he and his partner (played by Keenen Ivory Wayans) are investigating a
series of ritual killings, Cole himself becomes a suspect, especially when
a background check run by Campbell reveals practically nothing on Cole.</P>
<P>It turns out that Cole is a former trained government assassin (you just
can't trust these homicide detectives), someone whom victims used to catch
just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them, and hence, well,
you know, that "glimmer man" thing. An increasingly fishy homicide
investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a
larger, more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman
(Bob Gunton), Cole's former CIA boss (Brian Cox) and deals involving
chemical weapons.</P>
<P>THE GLIMMER MAN plot is pretty standard stuff, drawing (as with his other
films) elements from the hotter films of the year (eg, SE7EN). It's the
other changes that disappoint.</P>
<P>For example, although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie,
there's also the disastrous pairing of Seagal with Keenen Ivory Wayans,
probably the best known of the Wayans tribe (how many are there, exactly?)
from television's "In Living Colour." Wayans plays whiney straightman to
Seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped Cole, keeping up his "are you
crazy" part of the dialogue with wasted zest. As Campbell, Wayans confines
himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits, but the chemistry
between the two is minimal, and Seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful
watching.</P>
<P>A cook in UNDER SEIGE 2, Seagal is now a Buddhist who speaks Chinese and
wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black
ensemble. He chants, refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces
Campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies. Again, a benign (if
trite) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits
require Seagal to speak more than usual. Heck, he has to deliver punchlines
and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large
part of the film. Is that a lot to ask of the Seague? Too much.</P>
<P>Seagal's best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this
already complicated world of movies: to crunchily snap off bad guy
appendages, and to do it silently, and alone. Not for Seagal, the snappy
one-liners of Arnold and Stallone, nor the attempts to show that he can
act, much less think. No KINDERGARTEN COP, no OSCAR, just simple,
unadulterated deathblows. That's really how it must have started:
like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch The Seague
do his thing, knowing that never in the Seagal universe would they ever
have to see him do anything else. We trusted him. We got to know him. Now, 
betrayal.</P>
<P>I don't know if I can watch another Seagal movie without that little
niggling doubt that he's going to try to be funny again. I'll try, but it
won't be easy. If you haven't watched THE GLIMMER MAN yet, you might want
to wait for the video to come out. It's easier to just fast forward the
dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences. After all, if we can't
depend on our fantasies, what can we depend on?</P>
<P>The Flying Inkpot Rating System:
 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</FONT>
