<P>Playwright Tom Stoppard and screenwriter Marc Norman took on an
astonishingly difficult task:  they wanted to write a script about
William Shakespeare that parallels Shakespeare's works.  They also
wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision Shakespeare:  I mean,
really, who doesn't think of Shakespeare as a guy seething with so much
passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a
passionate, introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter?  Stoppard
and Norman are men who love Shakespeare, and they wanted to make a movie
for everyone else who loves Shakespeare.</P>
<P>And, despite the difficulty of their task, they have succeeded. 
Shakespeare in Love is one of the smartest, funniest, most touching
films of the year.   It's so rare that a picture with such high
aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors, but here we have a movie
that defines success:  it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly
written.  It could have been a smug, self-important movie that panders
to die-hard Shakespeare fans, but the appeal of this film is almost
universal:  if you've ever read a play by Shakespeare, or know anything
about his life, it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in
Shakespeare in Love.</P>
<P>Joseph Fiennes, brother of Ralph, stars as Shakespeare himself; he's a
delightful, irresistible lad, concerned mostly with women and detached
from life's more serious problems (debt, plague, etc.).  He's
commissioned to write plays for various people:  Queen Elizabeth (Judi
Dench) wants comedies, while local slimeball Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey
Rush) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to Hugh
Fennymann (Tom Wilkinson).  Shakespeare, however, has trouble focusing
on his work.  He begins work on a comedy about a boy named Romeo and a
girl named Ethel.</P>
<P>This all changes, however, when he meets Viola De Lesseps (a radiant
Gwyneth Paltrow), a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented
Lord Wessex (Colin Firth).  Shakespeare instantly falls in love with
her; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the
part of Romeo.  He discovers her identity and confronts her later; she,
of course, falls in love with him, although their love is doomed because
she absolutely must marry the tyrannical Lord Wessex.  But she continues
to act because she loves Shakespeare's writing so much, and soon the
production (which later becomes Romeo and Juliet) is set to be
performed.</P>
<P>Shakespeare in Love is an amazingly good film, not because it works as
great entertainment, but because it pays attention to detail and knows
its subject matter.  I was instantly won over by Joseph Fiennes in the
lead role:  he has such searing optimism and energy; he's clearly a man
who admires Shakespeare, and even in the shortcomings that he gives his
character (inability to turn away from women, attention deficit
disorder), we sense a great deal of affection and care.  He practically
overflows with passion in every scene.  Fiennes is matched by Paltrow
(whose English accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes
from); she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every
performance I've seen her in.  The two performers work perfectly
together, taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making
them melodramatic, and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable
laugh.</P>
<P>Of course, it doesn't hurt that they have a masterful script to work
with.  Stoppard, whose play Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead
inspired an interesting film, is full of dry wit and boundless
understated humor (all of his plays have similarly dry humor).  The
first intelligent step Stoppard and Norman took was harmonizing the
events of the film with Romeo and Juliet.  One of the funniest scenes in
the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play; in
the movie, Shakespeare is bumbling about while Viola is trying to fend
off her nurse maid.  Director John Madden does a fantastic job dabbling
in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the
hands of a lesser director.</P>
<P>I'm going to have to see the movie again; I'm certain there are
numerous references that I missed.  In fact, I doubt it's possible to
gather everything with just one viewing.  Stoppard is a master of
detail:  you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film, not as
lines of a play, but as dialogue, suggesting that Shakespeare simply
spoke like that all the time.  There's also a brilliant running joke in
which Shakespeare is in constant competition with Christopher Marlowe
(and the fact that Marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual Rupert
Everett is a joke in of itself), proposing a slightly twisted
explanation to Marlowe's mysterious death in a pub.  There's also a
scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that I hurt myself
laughing.  "There's no dog in this play?"  "No!  No dog!"</P>
<P>The ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year.  Geoffrey Rush is
nearly unrecognizable as the detestable Henslowe; Wilkinson is also hard
to recognize, but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the
apothecary so seriously.  Ben Affleck, playing one of the actors in the
company, shows great range, both in his accent (his is almost as good as
Paltrow's) and in humor (he has some of the best one-liners in the
movie).  Colin Firth, always stuck playing the sap, does a good job
being hateful.  Judi Dench, however, has the best supporting performance
as Queen Elizabeth:  rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few
words.  </P>
<P>My single, minor complaint about Shakespeare in Love is that I feel
like I could have been more moved by the end.  The story is moving, but
there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes.  But my
quibbling is not important.  What is important is that I acknowledge the
quality of this picture, the sheer skill with which it has been written,
acted, and produced.  Shakespeare in Love tries so many things, and
nails every one of them:  it's a film that both loves Shakespeare and
makes fun of him, a film in which the actors, writers, and director are
all perfectly in sync.  It's also a movie that has the potential to
introduce a lot of people to Shakespeare's work in a positive way,
without seeming condescending or superior.  I admire this film not only
because it passes so pleasantly, but because it has lofty aspirations
and succeeds in them.  Not just any film can poke fun at Shakespeare and
get away with it.</P>
