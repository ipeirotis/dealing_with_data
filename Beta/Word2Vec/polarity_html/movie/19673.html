LE TROU (THE HOLE) (director: Jacques Becker; writer: Jacques Becker;
cinematographer: Ghislain Cloquet; cast: Marc Michel (Claude Gaspard),
Michel Constantin (Geo Cassid), Raymond Meunier (Monsignore), Jean
Keraudy (Roland Darban), Philippe Leroy (Manu Borelli), André Bervil
(Warden), Catherine Spaak (Nicole), Fr./It.-1960)</P>
<P>Set entirely in the Sante prison, in 1947, this based-on-fact,
intriguingly detailed escape film rivals Bresson's A Man Escaped for
intensity and character development. This thriller is so magnificently
staged, building on the tension ordinarily found in such a confining
place and magnifying it tenfold, as each prisoner must dig within
himself for answers to why he is in prison and he must also dig inside
the prison cell down to the sewer in order to escape.</P>
<P>Claude Gaspard (Marc Michel) is a clean-cut, handsome, well-mannered
27-year-old, accused by his slightly older, rich wife, of trying to
murder her during an argument over money, as he  tried to take the
shotgun away from her and it accidently went off hitting her in the
shoulder. He is charged with a pre-meditated manslaughter attempt,
something that can get him 10- years in the slammer if convicted.</P>
<P>When he is transferred into a cellblock made up of hardened inmates
because his cell is undergoing repairs, he is met with suspicion by his
four new cellmates, who are planning on an escape and do not want an
outsider to join them. All the sounds heard in the cell are the ones you
would normally hear in a prison. There was no background music to take
your mind off where you were, and by going through in precise real-time
movements the daily prison grind, the constant personal searches and
searches of the food parcels the men received, with the guard slicing up
the rice puddings looking for files and such, the viewer gets the
feeling what prison life is like for the men.</P>
<P>The men cunningly grill Claude, with Monsignore (Meunier) taking the
I-can-be-your-friend approach, while Manu (Leroy) and Roland (Keraudy)
do not readily open up to him, as they are still unsure if he will get a
long enough sentence to chance the escape or if they can actually trust
him. While Michel Constantin (Geo) questions him about his wife, getting
from him that he was having an affair with his wife's 17-year-old
sister, Nicole (Spaak), which is probably the real reason the argument
took place.</P>
<P>There is something about Claude that makes him stick out as an outsider,
someone you don't feel right about. Maybe its just that he comes off as
too cunningly mannipulative in his contact with others to be thought of
as a true friend.Yet, he fits in so well with his new cellmates by not
calling attention to himself and acting grateful for their quiet
acceptance of him, that it is easy to see how he could be accepted by
the men.</P>
<P>That the warden seems to like him and after a few encounters with him
over minor disciplinary matters, actually takes an interest in his case,
makes the other prisoners take notice of him and become suspicious. But
they decide to go on with their plans, thinking it is too late to turn
back now. They have accepted Claude as one of them, as there was no
reason not to, and feel that he has done his part so far in helping them
dig a tunnel and has even shared with them the food parcels he has
received.</P>
<P>On the night of the planned escape, he is called into the warden's
office and told that his wife has dropped the charges against him. But
he stays with the warden for 2 hours, allowing the men to realize that
something is up, as no prisoner stays that long to chat with the warden;
but it is too late, he has already betrayed them to gain for himself a
reduced sentence.</P>
<P>This was Jacques Becker's last film; he died shortly after the film was
released. What he has created in this thriller is a marvel in simplicity
and understated relationships, showing how uncertain it could be to
trust an outsider with your life.That the prisoners, in someway,
understood Claude's flawed character and could accept his reason for
betrayal, though he would never be safe in their company again, is
readily seen on the hardened expressions they have as Claude is led away
to another cell after his ill deed and one of them says, "poor little
Claude," as the guards icily take him to another cell.</P>
