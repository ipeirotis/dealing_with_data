<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>How do you escape from totalitarian Iran if you are a woman prisoner and
have just escaped from jail or have a temporary pass from jail? The
film's theme is about how women are made to suffer in Iran because of
its harsh Islamic laws against them, which makes all of their lives
placed in the same never ending circle of repression. Which is why the
film has no main protagonist; the cast, except for Fereshteh Sadr Orafai
and Fatemeh Naghavi, are all nonprofessionals. Jafar Panahi (White
Balloon/The Mirror), a disciple of Abbas Kiarostami, has created a
devastatingly restrained powerhouse of a political film. A winner of the
Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, even though it has been banned
in Iran except for a one-time screening to a small student audience. It
got an international release, and has been well-received in all the
countries it has so far played in.</P>
<P>It is a gut-wrenching, neorealism film, filled with an ominous tenseness
that begins with the opening dark scene at a hospital maternity ward
when a grandmother is told that her daughter's child is not a boy but a
girl and she reacts with horror, saying that her daughter's in-laws will
never accept the child and will seek a divorce. She wonders how the
ultrasound could be wrong in saying the expectant child was to be a boy!</P>
<P>A woman's life is shown to be not as worthy as a man's in modern Iran,
as the story of one woman is carried on as the story of another woman's.
So we never follow one protagonist, but a myriad of disenfranchised
women; and, we are never sure what they are up to or where they are
going, but they are all troubled because they are unescorted and have no
man in their life.</P>
<P>Outside the hospital we leave the ruffled granny and follow three edgy
women clad in chadors, who just came out of prison on temporary passes
and plan not to return; they are on the street phone trying to get money
for transportation to some place far from Tehran. When one tries selling
a gold chain to a man who tries to steal it from her, she's taken into
custody by the police while the man is released. The other two flee the
area immediately; they are very nervous types who keep changing their
plans leaving us unsure of where they are going and what they are up to:
Nargess (Mamizadeh), an 18-year-old with an unexplained purplish bruise
under her eye, who is capitivated by an imitation of a van Gogh picture
she sees on the busy street. She thinks it's a picture of her country
neighborhood, but that the artist forgot to put flowers in certain
spots. The older woman, the pock-faced and always gazing hawk-like
Arezou (Almani), might have secured the money by turning a trick. But
when it comes time to get on the bus, she for some reason can't and
sends the reluctant teenager on alone to her hometown. Nargess can't
purchase a bus ticket because she's a woman without an ID card and
without an escort, but she talks the reluctant ticket seller into
believing she's a student who left her ID card home. But for some
unexplained reason she goes to a buy a man's shirt and misses the bus to
her paradise location. This comes after she tries unsuccessfully to
contact a pregnant woman, Pari (Orafai), who escaped from jail but is
kicked out of her parent's house because they are disgraced by her being
unmarried and pregnant. She escaped from prison to get an illegal
abortion, as Iran doesn't allow for abortions without the approval of
the husband. Her pregnancy is explained as occurring when her husband
was executed 4 months ago and she was allowed one last visit.</P>
<P>We follow Pari as she makes contact with her ex-prison friend, who now
works as a ticket seller in a movie theater and who accepts that her
husband took another wife while she was in prison by proudly saying
she's still the Number 1 wife. From her she finds out the address of her
other ex-prison friend, Elham (Saboktakin), who works as a nurse in a
hospital. She hopes through her contacts that she'll secure an abortion
for her. But her friend refuses to help, telling her she married a
Pakistani doctor and he knows nothing of her past. She does not want to
ruin her current marriage by disclosing anything else about herself, but
this news is crushing to Pari who has nowhere else to turn to. On the
street she feels pity for a girl who is being abandoned by her mother
(Naghavi), but when she talks with the mother she sees how torn she is
about what she's doing and only tries to talk her into getting her child
back. Everything about this Iranian regime smacks of an unfeeling
attitude towards women, leaving them with little hope. The only hope is
shown by a wedding party, as the filmmaker comically cuts into different
scenes of them throughout the film; the wedding for the woman, at least,
starts out as a joyous experience.</P>
<P>The most powerful scene in the film is the arrest of a young prostitute,
Mojgan (Faramarzi), who is wearing makeup and got into the car of a
male. Her arrest comes at the same time as the mother who abandoned her
child gets into the car of an unmarked police car and is arrested, but
who escapes when the police get involved with the arrest of the
prostitute. When the prostitute is put into the paddy wagon and carted
off to jail, she tries to smoke a cigarette. But the police guards tell
her there is no smoking, this is a running gag throughout the film, as
women are not allowed to smoke in public but are always trying to sneak
in a smoke. When the male prisoner offers the guards a free cigarette
he's allowed to smoke, which encourages the prostitute to freely puff
away and she feels a release of frustration as the smoke comes rapidly
out of her mouth. It is these small acts of rebellion that give these
women some hope, and what they share with the audience is a camaraderie
against their repressors. The enemy obviously isn't the Iranian people,
but an intolerant government that cannot bend and forces its stupid
rules down a subjected peoples' throats. This film conveys these dark
feelings through a story without much of a plot or dialogue, yet
brilliantly establishes the yearnings for freedom that these women have.
It's much like those Warner Brother films of the 1930s with Jimmy Cagney
thumbing his nose at the high brows. Panafi has taken us into the psyche
of the oppressive regime and without saying what's right or wrong,
allows us instead to see for ourselves the everyday street life of
modern Iran. It's a country far from freedom, yet its filmmakers can
still make a film that is unpredictable and forthright. This is
something that's rarely accomplished in uncensored Hollywood whose
commercial ventures are mostly formulaic crowd pleaser films.</P>
<P>The women featured in this tale remain mysterious to us: we are never
told what crimes they are charged with. All we see are the repressions
they are faced with: no smoking in public, no abortions, they can't
enter certain places without a chador wrapped around them, they can't
get hotel accomodations without IDs, take rides when alone with men, and
they can't even buy a bus ticket when alone. These are amazing
restrictions placed on them and ones that Panafi allows us to see in an
exciting and unforgettable way. It's a moody, realistic tale about Iran
that the news media can't seem to cover with a reasonable verisimilitude
as well as this very daring effort does. It succeeds in showing us as
much as one can in today's Iran about its long laundry list of
injustices. There's little room to see The Circle as anything but a way
all Iranian women are kept as prisoners and how their stories of
repression continue on from one woman to another. When we lose sight of
one woman, the next woman's story could be just as horrendous. This is
one film that cannot easily be forgotten, even as we lose sight of the
different women we have seen. All the performances were natural and
easily fit into the story. The facial expressions of both Orfani and
Mamizade caught my attention: Orfani's had that caring, intense look of
the Italian actress Anna Magnani; while Mamizade's expression changed
from curiosity to vulnerability. She seemed to have a radiance that lit
up the screen and best caught the desperation of their situation.</P>
