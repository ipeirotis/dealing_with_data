<P>     I see Spike Lee working.  I have a pretty good idea what he was up to
with SUMMER OF SAM.  This would his a saga of a more dangerous New York
circa 1977, when the Big Apple was more famous for muggings than for
musicals.  It would be a tale of how paranoia can amplify the xenophobia
that already exists in so many people.  It would be a story of one very
specific demon -- "Son of Sam" serial killer David Berkowitz (Michael
Badalucco) -- which also explored the demons many of us keep hidden just
beneath the surface.  It would be an examination of the uncomfortable link
between the criminal and the tabloid media that exploited him.  It would
be both ambitious and intimate, both a period piece and a piece of who we
still are.  It would be an Important Film.</P>
<P>     I see Spike Lee working, and I saw SUMMER OF SAM working...up to a
point.  His account (co-written with Victor Colicchio and Micheal
Imperioli) of New York's hot, hellish summer of '77 focuses on two Bronx
neighborhood buddies and their relationships.  Vinny (John Leguizamo) is a
hairdresser with trouble remaining faithful in his marriage to Dionna
(Mira Sorvino); Ritchie (Adrien Brody) is a would-be punk rocker who has
moved to the Village and taken up with Ruby (Jennifer Esposito), a
neighborhood girl with a "reputation."  Though they now live in different
worlds -- Vinny's a little bit Studio 54, Ritchie's a little bit CBGB's --
they remain friends.  That friendship becomes dangerous as the summer
heats up, fear of the .44-caliber killer intensifies, and the guys in the
neighborhood begin making their own personal lists of suspects, including
Ritchie.</P>
<P>     For a while, the stories of Lee's two main characters are promising
enough that SUMMER OF SAM keeps you watching.  Vinny begins to
disintegrate after a close encounter with the killer leaves him torn
between a desire to reform and his inability to control his libido.
Ritchie, meanwhile, uses dancing and turning tricks at a gay club to
support his drug habit and budding career, his external outsider image
hiding an even more outsider lifestyle.  Leguizamo is particularly strong
in his role (will someone _please_ put this guy's talent to good use?),
but both characters work in juxtaposition to the Son of Sam -- they're
anti-social people who happen to functionally anti-socials.  Though the
period production design comes and goes, there's still a strong sense of
this particular time and place in New York.  We see 1977 as a more intense
period in the life of the city, when the thin connecting thread of rooting
for the Yankees was always ready to snap into violence.</P>
<P>     There are lots of big issues moving through SUMMER OF SAM, and Lee is
ready to make sure we always know it.  As talented a visual stylist as he
can be, Spike Lee is also a film-maker who often doesn't know when to stop
himself.  He gets infatuated with distorted perspectives, or finds some
way to cram in his favored "character moving on the camera track" shot, or
edits not one but two montages to the accompaniment of songs by The Who.
Lee even opens with an extended crane shot that serves as a big flashing
red light that the director wants TOUCH OF EVIL/BOOGIE NIGHTS respect for
his project.  It's often invigorating, but it's also an attempt to cover
for a story that lets some sub-plots drag on forever (Vinny and Dionna's
ho-hum marital woes) while letting others disappear just when they seem
interesting (Anthony LaPaglia as a detective with mob ties in his
background).  Lee may be talented, but his pure id approach to directing
leads to some baffling decisions.</P>
<P>     No decision in SUMMER OF SAM is more baffling -- or more harmful to
the film -- than Lee's portrayal of Berkowitz himself.  It was a risky
enough maneuver introducing Berkowitz as a character at all rather than
leaving him as a bogeyman haunting the periphery of the film; it was even
riskier to show him freaking out in his apartment.  But Lee goes past the
point of no return when he actually shows a big black dog telling
Berkowitz to kill in John Turturro's voice, lips moving like he was a
refugee from BABE.  That scene turns a killer's demented rampage into
absurdist comedy, making you wonder what the hell Lee was thinking.
Clearly he had ideas spilling out of himself as he prepared for SUMMER OF
SAM, a million different stories he wanted to tell in this one story about
the naked city.  At times it gels into a gripping film.  At other times,
you can see Lee working...and you can see him working far too hard.</P>
