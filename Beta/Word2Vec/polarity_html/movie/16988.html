<PRE>A REVIEW OF "8MM"
by Ryan Ellis</PRE>
<P>give me a buzz on the ol' e-lines, <A HREF="mailto:iluvmick@hotmail.com">iluvmick@hotmail.com</A></P>
<P>What's to like about the world of extremely violent trash
pornography--ie. the garbage known as "snuff" films? Nothing,
right? What's to like about a film chronicling the world of
violent trash pornography? Well...nothing. So, why make it,
Hollywood? There's no reason why the average, sane movie-goer
will be interested in such a topic. No one is going to enrich
their life or have a good time by watching material such as this.
The lack of quality filmmaking in "8MM" (from technical to
acting) stands out even more when you consider the star, writer,
and supporting cast--all reputable. But Joel Schumacher and his
brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again! Like Paul Schrader,
Schumacher has his moments, but they're few and far (FAR!)
between. Basically, this picture is crap and NO ONE should pay to
see it. Why not walk out? Well, this wouldn't be a thorough
review about a thoroughly bad movie. Here's why you should spend
your money on dog food or gum instead of "8MM"...</P>
<P>First thing--if you don't heed my advice, then understand what
you're about to see before you even THINK about paying good money
for this crud. It's not easy to watch. I didn't know the details
of the story beforehand, but at least my ignorance can help
others now. The (HA!) plot revolves around Tom Welles (Nicolas
Cage) as a surveillance expert and Private Investigator. A rich
old woman discovers a "snuff" film in her late husband's safe.
She calls Welles and hires him to try and find out if the young
girl (it had to be a young girl, didn't it, Schumacher!) who
appears to be murdered in the film really is dead. She's
horrified that her husband would have owned such a film (in 8mm,
of course) and just wants Welles to snoop around without police
interference to see what he can find. Family-man Welles agrees
against better judgement or any concrete leads even after
cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque "murder".</P>
<P>Let me backtrack for a moment. See, "snuff" films are pornos with
a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up
dead. However, the deaths are often staged and, in those cases,
special effects and "good" acting make all the difference. Very
sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find
movies. The thought of this "industry" makes me want to throw my
computer out the window and stop this review, but I'll swallow my
bile and move on.</P>
<P>Welles follows clues to Hollywood and the porn industry. You'd
think he's Sherlock Holmes the way clues drop so easily for him!
He comes across smut clerk Max (Joaquin Phoenix) who knows
everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze.
After a lot of digging and bribing, Welles finds the men who are
responsible for making this, and other, "snuff" films. Skip
ahead, skip ahead, skip ahead... Led by Dino Velvet (Peter
Stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance) and
star-torturer "Machine" (Christopher Bauer), they have a big
showdown with Welles where death and mayhem ensue. The movie
doesn't end there, unfortunately, because Welles has to do what
all heroes in Schumacher films do--become a vigilante.</P>
<P>This film doesn't draw you in. It keeps you about 700 miles away
from it and who in their right mind would want to get close? It
IS possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick
behaviour (ie. "Se7en"), but it takes a large measure of
restraint (Schumacher has none) and a larger amount of talent
(Schumacher has little). By those jabs, I'm not only referring to
his stylish destruction of the "Batman" franchise, but "A Time To
Kill" was an immensely overrated disappointment. For a guy who
gets so much studio money, his track record of making rather bad
movies is unparalleled.</P>
<P>A good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically
watch even disgusting subject matter. Writer Andrew Kevin Walker
didn't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored
for '95s twisted thriller, "Se7en". Director Schumacher doesn't
have that innate ability to make you watch things you don't
really want to see like better directors are capable of doing. He
must not have believed Hitchcock who espoused the theory that
what we don't see is more frightening than what we do (especially
when it's a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered).
However, gratuitous is Joel's middle name.</P>
<P>He must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex
is showing plenty of tactful restraint. No, he doesn't go THAT
far, but we see enough unpleasantness. He doesn't leave much to
the imagination. It's manipulating to hurt (or kill) young girls
just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante.
The script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these
characters, yet Schumacher has no subtlety in his (HA HA!) craft.
Case in point, a shot of a Christian Fellowship bus (good,
right?) drives away to reveal one of the villains (bad, right?).
See...no subtlety. Does Joel think we're stupid or that we need
to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery? Who
do we root for in this mess? Is there anybody out there?</P>
<P>It's not all the director's fault, though. Why did the actors
sign up for this? Nicolas Cage is an Oscar-winner, for cryin' out
loud! If he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the
artistic merit rather than the money, what was he smoking when
this script dropped on his veranda? What is Cage supposed to be
in this movie--a whispering Batman without the charisma and
pointed ears? Villainous Peter Stormare is five steps past hammy.
And what is James Gandolfini doing in this trash? He was so solid
as a concerned father in "A Civil Action". I guess ol' Nic, Pete,
and Jim were promised a mountain of money...or they're suckers.
Or they just don't care.</P>
<P>There ARE moments (albeit brief ones) where this rises above the
wasteland. Catherine Keener is good (although too quick to
threaten divorce) as Mrs. Wells. Baby Cindy is obviously cute and
Wells' devout love of his daughter is sweet. The mother (Amy
Norton) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a
woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter.
This film has an appropriate blue-toned, washed-out look like
"Payback" (which was a MUCH better movie). The editing is okay in
scenes of no dialogue, but at other times it's rough. During some
conversations, close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well,
making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren't
good and whose timing was a half-second off. Such a technical
error indeed stands out. Speaking of standing out, don't believe
the misleading trailers. There's not much action here.
Occasionally, yes, but not as often as your TV will have you
believe.</P>
<P>After seeing "8MM", I may not be interested in ever watching ANY
kind of porn again. Is that a positive? Well, if making me almost
ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their
motive, they've done a swell job here. It'll be a long time
before I give a Schumacher film another chance--unless I lose my
mind and become seriously depraved. But today I'm not depraved,
so I ask, why does this film preach that this garbage is out
there and that society should be worried about it? I'm sure that
somewhere right now there's some pretty sick crap going on, but
that doesn't mean I need to know about it. Yes, Mr. Walker, your
script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there.
Yes, Mr. Walker, the proverbial monster doesn't look like we
expect him to. You said all that in 1995. Move on.</P>
<P>This film serves no purpose. It doesn't entertain, it doesn't
teach us anything, it doesn't make a statement beyond the obvious
"this stuff is bad" approach. Only if this film awakens the
authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would
it ever do someting truly worthwhile. That's not likely to
happen, though, so "8MM" is indeed a scummy waste of money. Orson
Welles said years ago in a tribute to film, "To movies...to good
movies". If only Joel Schumacher and the producers had listened
and told Andrew Kevin Walker to bury this crud deep in a hole.
Like "snuff" films, "8MM" should never have been made. Now,
excuse me while I go try to forget I ever saw it.</P>
<P>USELESS TRIVIA--Joel Schumacher loves the vigilante theme. He
used it in "Batman Forever", in "Batman & Robin", in "A Time To
Kill", in "Falling Down", and it's rumoured that Joel himself
will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow...</P>
