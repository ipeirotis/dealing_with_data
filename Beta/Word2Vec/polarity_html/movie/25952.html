<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Filmed in the harsh conditions of 1945 Rome, when Italy was just
liberated from the German occupation, a movie such as "Open City" was
not a priority in the postwar period. All the country's money was needed
to rebuilt, as movies seemed a frivolous activity at the time.
Rossellini used poor film stock leftover from the Fascists and filmed
despite all the technical deficiencies he ran into, and came up with a
gritty, authentic looking film for his grim story of survival and fight
for freedom. This was a breakthrough film for the director, whose
neorealism style, using a Hollywood type of narrative and a documentary
style approach to filming, caught the dire mood of the Resistance
movement and the ordinary people who fought the fascists. It is a
melodramatic story about good and evil, with the poor, suffering,
hardworking people being good, and those who sold their soul for money,
luxury, vice, betrayal, or false ideals, were the evil ones. It also
showed how the Resistance fighters were members of the Communist party
and were atheists, while their sometime partners, the Catholic church,
were their opposite but still sided with them due to the horrible
suffering the people faced.</P>
<P>Awards such as the New York Film Critics Circle and Best Film in Cannes
in 1946, came to this film. It awakened an international audience to the
knowledge that Italian cinema was well and Roberto Rossellini was a
director to be reckoned with, along with De Sica, who just filmed "Shoe
Shine" in the neorealism style, also, to international acclaim.</P>
<P>Idealistic Resistance leader Manfredi (Pagliero) is on the run, his
group got word that there is an informer among them. He goes to the
apartment of a sympathizer Francesco (Grandjacquet), who can help the
cause through his trade as a printer, as he transfers money into a book
for shipment to those Resistance fighters in the field. But since
Manfredi can't go himself to carry out this assignment, he asks for
help. Francesco's pregnant girlfriend lives next door to him, Pina
(Magnani). She lives in poverty with her extended family, and her young
son Marcello (Vito) and a sister Lauretta (Carla) who is aspiring to be
an actress and is ashamed of her impoverished family. The widow Pina is
earthy, the quintessence of Italian femininity, plus she's a nurturing
mother. She believes in God and is ashamed she became pregnant before
getting married, but is happy that she will marry Francesco tomorrow.
She returns with a bag full of bakery items, as her neighbors looted the
bakery. When asked by Manfredi, she sends her son to get the local
priest, Don Pietro (Fabrizi), who is sympathetic to the Resistance
movement to come over, and he agrees to take the dangerous assignment
Manfredi asks him to do.</P>
<P>Manfredi has been fooling around with an attractive but insincere
actress, Marina (Michi), a friend of Lauretta's. But he finds her thirst
for money to be something he can't live with anymore, and tries to get
word to her that he wants to break up.</P>
<P>The Gestapo, under a paricularly malevolent Major Bergmann (Feist),
raids Pina's building and arrests Francesco for routine questioning on
his wedding day. Pina is alarmed by this and runs in the street after
him, but gets shot down by the Nazis chasing the lorry he's in. When
Francesco is released, he joins Manfredi in Marina's luxurious
apartment, as they are desperate for a place to stay. She overhears them
talking about meeting the priest and turns this information over to the
major's cold-hearted assistant Ingrid (Giovanna Galletti), who plies
Marina with clothes, theater work, and money. The information proves
correct and they capture the priest, Manfredi, and a deserting Austrian
soldier (Ákos Tolnay), as the the priest supplied them with false I.D.
cards to escape the country.</P>
<P>In a very brutal conclusion, Manfredi is tortured to get information out
of him, the deserter hangs himself, and the priest is executed by a
firing squad. The film has an immediacy about it, but it also seemed
overly melodramatic at times, relying so much on the premise, that by
being as good as the Germans, the Italians, the slave-race, can prove
that there was no need for the war since there is no such thing as a
master race. That Manfredi dies without talking after being tortured,
makes his heroics larger than anyone else's, and proves that the
Italians are every bit as good as the Germans. Rossellini hoped to
examine the Italian soul and show that there were both good and bad
people among them, while the German's have gone so far off the edge of
sanity, that it is hard to find a good German because of their perverse
beliefs.</P>
<P>Through the portrayal of the Gestapo torturer Feist and his sidekick
Galletti, the Germans are viewed as perverse homosexuals and godless
animals who have lost their sense of what it is to be human. They can
only relate to others in an obscene way.</P>
<P>Anna Magnani gives the film credibility through her humanity, as her
story is filled with her heartfelt yearnings. The other professional
actor among all the nonprofessionals to standout, was the priest role as
warmly played by Aldo Fabrizi, who elicited a call for sensibility and
caring for people. Though, the film does not seem as relevant as it was
when first released and acclaimed as a masterpiece, having lost some of
its purity, nevertheless, it still retains its moral high ground and its
ability to show the collective will of the people, who resisted being
oppressed. It is still a work of considerable merit.</P>
