<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Abbas Kiarostami's brilliantly perceptive film is based on a true story,
but is done in mock-documentary style. It is about Hossain Sabzian
playing himself, as an impostor of the famous Iranian filmmaker Mohsen
Makhmalbaf (The Cyclist), who has been arrested on charges of fraud.</P>
<P>Sabzian meets an upper-class woman on a bus and when she inquires about
the book he is reading by Mohsen Makhmalbaf, he impulsively gives her
the book and tells her he is the director. During the course of their
conversation he gets invited to her home, where he meets her husband
(Abolfazl Ahankhah) and a son (Mehrdad), who is an engineer but can't
get work and is now interested in the arts. Sabzian fills the family
full of ideas about shooting a film in their house, with their son
starring in it.</P>
<P>This slow-moving, temperately structured film, shot in the cinéma-vérité
style so that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between what is
real and what is reconstructed, has a curious fascination about it. The
film opens when a reporter (Farazmand) has been called to the home of
Mr. Ahankhah because he suspects the person in his house is a fraud. The
reporter comes by taxi with two soldiers and has the impostor arrested.
He is gleeful that this could be his godsend story, as it makes the
headlines in his newspaper. He asks the court authorities to speed up
the trial, as the accused has been in prison for three weeks on this
petty charge and he wants to film the trial while the story is still hot
in the news.</P>
<P>The film covers the trial in depth, using the testimony of the son and
the accused to look back at what unfolded in the 40 days since this
deception took place. The accused is charged with fraud and of lending
money under false pretenses and not paying it back. He is an unemployed
printer, who is divorced with one child being raised by his mother while
his wife has taken the other child. He claims to be a lover of films, an
ardent admirer of Mohsen Makhmalbaf, whose films move him the way they
portray suffering. He just reads books on film and has never worked on
one before, but always wanted to be a director.</P>
<P>What comes out at the trial, is that he never attempted to rob the
house, but loved taking on the identity of the famous director, as it
boosted his morale and gave him the respect he never got before. He also
looks somewhat like the director, but not enough to fool anyone who has
ever seen what the director looks like.</P>
<P>The film has a somewhat curious aesthetic feel to it, as the director's
motivations seem to be largely a test for the audience to see if they
really know what they are getting from their experience in viewing a
film. All those who testify, tell the truth from their own viewpoint, as
some of the dialogue is pleasingly witty and some of the observations
made are extremely sharp. Sabzian says when asked to comment on his stay
in jail, "Prisons are good for the good, but bad for the bad."</P>
<P>At the film's conclusion, Kiarostami wants to make sure that we know it
is only a film, as he has the pardoned Sabzian return with flowers to
the home of Mr. Ahankhah. He follows him with his cameras, but the audio
equipment malfunctions and the sound becomes partially muted. The
director forces us to be alerted that what we are seeing is not real
life, and that it is made possible only through technology. But what he
has done up until that point, is use his close-up lens to focus in on
the accused and see what he is all about. Sabzian comes off as a
dreamer, someone who has not found out who he is and is confused as to
who he can be. He is not a criminal in the sense of what we think a
criminal is, and this compelling film lets us think of him in whatever
way we want to, as we watch this film as viewer, judge, and jury. The
marvelous thing, is that Kiarostami can get superb performances from the
non-professional actors as well as the professionals, because as Sabzian
stated during the trial, acting is just being yourself, letting it all
come out from the heart.</P>
<P>This is just a wonderful film, with Kiarostami's humor prevailing. It is
also an interesting look at modern Iran, its bureaucracy, its class
divisions, its high unemployment, and its seemingly fair-minded court
system.</P>
