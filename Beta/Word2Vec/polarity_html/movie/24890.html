<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Small Time Crooks is a small time comedy, nourished by getting a fast
start off the gate with some pretty familiar comedy routines -- it
starts off paying homage to the Italian film "Big Deal on Madonna
Street," but it is not able to sustain that homage or carry on with the
fast-paced comedy hi-jinks after the first half hour, and what's worst,
it falls into a predictable way of telling the story, which ends the
film on a rather pedestrian note. This film had the look of something
made in a film factory, without an edge to the routine comedy sequences.
But to its credit...it had a lot of laughs in it.</P>
<P>It gets by because the characters are likable crooks and funny in a
moronic way, Woody and Tracy had some good chemistry together as a
lowlife husband and wife team, and Woody has that nebbish part down pat
by now which he has been living off for the last 20 years. He seems to
have given up being an artistic filmmaker (I doubt if he ever was
committed to being one, but he did like Ingmar Bergman's "Wild
Strawberries," and at one time attempted to make Bergman-quality films).
He is now best seen as a merchandiser of films, cranking them out once a
year with a banker's regularity. He's certainly no risk taker in this
film, knowing his audience and giving them what they want might as well
be his motto. He is banking on the audience cravings for a few of his
patented one-liners to give them a comedy fix until his next predictable
work. There seems to be no incentive for him to change now, as his
audience wants him to keep cranking out the same stuff he's been doing
for years and he doesn't seem to have any sparkle in him to do something
different.</P>
<P>Woody's an ex-con and dishwasher named Ray Winkler who has come up with
a genius plan to get rich. His wife Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), the former
New Jersey exotic dancer, immediately guesses -- you plan to rob a bank!
He asks her for $6,000 that he needs for his scheme to rent a vacant
pizza storefront and buy equipment to tunnel into the bank vault two
doors down. There are two other partners who come by with their share of
the money to go into Woody's brilliant scheme, Denny (Rapaport), a dumb
truck driver, and Tommy (Darrow), a dumb human being. Another dumb
partner will be added later when Woody finds the store has been leased
to someone who plans to open a flower shop. When Woody comes calling to
sweet talk that person out of the lease, it turns out that person is one
of his prison mates, Ben (Lovitz), who hoped to ply his trade of arson
for insurance, which he says helped him put two kids through college.
But Woody persuades him to give up that lucrative profession to become
partners in his more lucrative scheme.</P>
<P>Ray and Frenchy open up a cookie shop as a cover for the robbery, but
the cookie business takes off beyond their wildest dreams and becomes
the talk of the city, while the tunneling runs into brain drainage
problems from these inept crooks, providing the sharpest and funniest
comedy in the film: as they tunnel in the wrong direction, rupture a
water main with their drilling, wear their miner's hard hat backward to
imitate the stylish way some kids wear their baseball caps, thereby the
light shines behind them so they can't see ahead, and the final
stupidity, is when Frenchy's dumb cousin May (Elaine May), hired to help
wait on the customers in the now busy store, tells a cop about the
tunneling in the basement being a business expansion move. Naturally,
the heist fizzles. But the cookie business miraculously becomes a smash
hit and is franchised so that within a short period Ray and Frenchy
become filthy rich.</P>
<P>Here's where this sweet and silly story plunges off the comedy map, as
it tries to show how Tracy now wants to grow as a person and join the
highbrows and get some culture, but she can't because she still remains
a vulgar person inside despite her new outward trappings. While Woody
takes the opposite track, bored by his new life-style, wanting only to
get away from eating snails and go back to eating cheese burghers. He
also would rather go to Miami and be swimming than attending socialite
parties and going to the ballet and art museums. The running gag here is
how cheap their taste is in their furnishings, decorations, clothes, and
vocabulary, before and after becoming rich.</P>
<P>Into the picture comes David (Grant), an intellectual snob and an
unscrupulous art dealer, which is quite a combination. They meet at one
of their ritzy gatherings in their Park Ave. apartment to raise money
for charity. He is talked into becoming the teacher of the arts to
Tracy, but without her suspecting it, he plans to rip her off for huge
sums of money. In the meantime, he influences her to buy schlock art
that he can't sell to anyone else. The movie looses its caper focus and
shows how the Winklers' try to join the social elites and the problems
they run into, as their money can't seem to buy them happiness or
acceptance.</P>
<P>The couple will divorce, with Tracy going to Europe with Grant to get
some culture, but forced to return when her franchise empire crumbles
because her accountants swindle her. While Woody uses Elaine May's help
to steal a valuable necklace at a party given by some of his new
aristocratic friends.</P>
<P>This results in a fluff film, with a twisted message about money not
being important to the couple, which seems like an out of the place
message, since money is all the couple talks about and seem to care
about as a means for their happiness. But this is a film that will only
succeed if it can make you laugh and the message wrongly or rightly
perceived might as well have not been sent. There are just enough Woody
sight gags and one-liners to make this film keep its head above water...
for example, one gag goes like this:"Hey, did you hear the one about
that Polish car pool that met at their workplace!!!" That's one of the
many yuks you'll get with Woody's 29th film, which will soon lose its
place in the heap of mediocrity he is piling up after his 1970s heyday
period of Love and Death (1975) and Annie Hall (1977).</P>
