<P>     Despite receiving a U.S. release on Good Friday, THE LAST SUPPER 
has nothing to do with religion.  Instead, it's a black comedy/satire 
that ruthlessly skewers political extremism by suggesting that the 
farther to the left or right you travel on the political spectrum, the 
closer you move to the same destination.  Call it "circular politics".  
According to Dan Rosen's script, it's possible for the most die-hard 
liberals to be as reactionary as their conservative counterparts.  </P>
<P>     While there's nothing new about this philosophy, THE LAST SUPPER 
approaches it from a fresh, decidedly unconventional perspective.  For 
the first thirty minutes, this picture takes a solid premise and runs 
with it.  Unfortunately, the momentum eventually flags, and THE LAST 
SUPPER meanders through an unnecessarily-protracted middle segment.  
Things don't snap back into focus until the final scenes.</P>
<P>     First time feature director Stacy Title (who helmed the 1993, 
Oscar-nominated short, "Down on the Waterfront") doesn't play favorites 
in the lampooning game -- liberals, conservatives, and moderates all get 
theirs.  THE LAST SUPPER also consciously attacks political correctness 
by depicting the somewhat-absurd lengths to which this predominant 
social philosophy can be taken.  The underlying message is that we 
should be more concerned with people and individual freedoms than with a 
specific ideology.</P>
<P>     THE LAST SUPPER introduces us to five graduate student housemates -
- Jude (Cameron Diaz), Paulie (Annabeth Gish), Luke (Courtney B. Vance), 
Marc (Jonathan Penner), and Pete (Ron Eldard).  Every-so-often, these 
friends invite a guest to dinner for a discussion about life and 
politics.  However, on one rainy evening when their invitee is a 
potentially-violent neo-Nazi named Zack (Bill Paxton), none of them is 
prepared for what transpires.  Zack doesn't appreciate their ideals.  In 
fact, he displays contempt for everything they stand for, and, to prove 
a point about the inherent weakness of liberals, he holds a blade to 
Marc's throat then breaks Pete's arm.  Concerned that they're all going 
to be killed, Marc plunges a nasty-looking knife into Zack's back.  
Suddenly, the five housemates have a corpse on their hands.  They decide 
to bury Zack in the back yard and pretend that the incident never 
happened.</P>
<P>     But that's not the end of it.  They realize that perhaps they have 
done humanity a favor by ridding it of such a misfit.  After debating 
the benefits of killing someone to make the world a better place, they 
formulate a plan to help rid society of certain "undesirable" elements.  
Then, having laced a bottle of wine with arsenic, they invite a 
different conservative type to dinner each day, and, if a guest displays 
views that are deemed too ignorant or hateful, they're offered a drink 
of the toxic liquid.  Racists, homophobes, misogynists, and anti-
abortionists come in through the front door, then end up in the back 
garden. </P>
<P>     One of the major problems with THE LAST SUPPER is that, following 
an auspicious setup, it stagnates.  After the first few murders, things 
get repetitious, and the script doesn't have anything new to offer until 
the end, when a Rush Limbaugh-like TV personality (Ron Perlman) enters 
the mix.  In the meantime, there's a pointless subplot about a local 
sheriff (Nora Dunn) searching for a missing young girl.  Although this 
eventually dovetails with the main story, the connection is too tenuous 
to be worth all the screen time spent on it.</P>
<P>     Occasionally, THE LAST SUPPER tries to be serious, but drama is by 
far the film's weakest element.  There are also attempt to develop 
character arcs for some of the one-dimensional protagonists, but these 
don't work, either.  Often-bizarre personality changes happen too 
abruptly to be credible.  </P>
<P>     None of the primary actors does an especially good job.  Cameron 
Diaz (the curvaceous beauty from THE MASK), has a few worthwhile scenes, 
as do Annabeth Gish (BEAUTIFUL GIRLS) and Courtney B. Vance (PANTHER).  
Jonathan Penner (DOWN PERISCOPE), on the other hand, gives an amateurish 
performance, and Ron Eldard (TV's ER) frequently blends in with the 
furniture.  The best turn is given by Ron Perlman in limited duty as the 
conservative media-hog.  Bill Paxton, Charles Durning, Mark Harmon, and 
Jason Alexander have cameos.</P>
<P>     Too often in motion pictures, the ideas are much better than the 
execution.  That's the case here.  The concept of a group of liberal 
students eliminating their political opponents by murder ("they're not 
people; they're people who hate") is ripe with promise.  But THE LAST 
SUPPER doesn't push the envelope far enough.  The edge could be better 
honed.  And, in the end, that makes pickings a little slim at this 
particular meal.</P>
