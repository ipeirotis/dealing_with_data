<PRE>"The Musketeer"</PRE>
<P>Alexandre Dumas meets Hong Kong action with newcomer Justin Chambers
reprising the oft-played character of dashing swordsman D'Artagnon in
director Peter Hyam's adventure "The Musketeer."</P>
<P>For some reason that I may figure out later, I don't know why the time,
money and effort were put into the making of "The Musketeer." It may be
that someone had the clever idea of combining the Dumas characters and
story with the current enamor with the action work of Hong Kong imports
like this film's Xin-Xin Xiong ("Once Upon a Time in China") and Yuen
Woo-Ping from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." The result is a mix of
genres that don't mesh well.</P>
<P>Elements of the Ritz Brothers-style comedy (for those few who remember that
comedic troupe from the 1939 "The Three Musketeers"), the Man with No Name
from "A Fistful of Dollars" (D'Artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize
to his horse in a direct ref to the Clint Eastwood spaghetti western) and
Hong Kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by
Gene Quintano. The result is an action flick that bears little resemblance
to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an
effort to grab the "Matrix" crowd. Alexandre Dumas may well be rolling in
his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters.</P>
<P>The real problem with the "The Musketeer" lies in the casting of the two
lead, romantically intertwined characters, D'Artagnan and Francesca (Mena
Suvari). Chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character, a
la Chris O'Donnell, but lacks any onscreen charisma. Suvari has the
doe-eyed, pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen, but
she, too, does not have the chemistry to command the screen. If "The
Musketeer" makes them any money, they should invest in acting lessons.
Stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is, on the surface, impressive. Catherine Denueve plays
the Queen of France and lends her character an air of royalty, dignity and
humor, especially when she plays off of D'Artagnan's mentor, Planchet
(Jean-Pierre Castaldi, who reminds of Andre the Giant in "The Princess
Bride). Stephen Rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper
Cardinal Richelieu, but is given very little to help flesh out his
character. Tim Roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the
Cardinal's chief henchman, Febre. He is so bad he makes Simon Legree look
like a boy scout. The rest of the players, particularly the three
musketeers Aramis (Nick Moran, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"),
Porthos (Steve Spiers) and Athos (Jan Gregor Kremp), are background fodder
whose role is to come to D'Artagnan's aid when needed.</P>
<P>Peter Hyam's does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too
stretched to do both well. A stronger hand at the helm could have helped
the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran
thesps. Photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all
the appropriate action flick motions - D'Artagnan takes on a tavern full of
thugs and bests them single-handed; he fights a gang of Febre's henchmen
aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen (with the obligatory branches
hanging over the road); he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy, Febre,
who murdered D'Artagnan's folks years before. It is all routine stuff.</P>
<P>The renowned wire work developed by the Hong Kong action masters is used to
artificial effect as the players leap, defying gravity, up walls and from
horse to horse. It works in a sci-fi film like "The Matrix" or in a
classical fantasy like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" but just calls
attention to itself in "The Musketeer." At one point I could swear I saw
the stunt wire being used. It did not make me a believer and I am very
disappointed. With a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like
80 and I give it a D.</P>
