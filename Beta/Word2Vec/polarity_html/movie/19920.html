BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, THE (director: Daniel Myrick; screenwriters: Daniel
Myrick/Eduardo Sanchez; cinematographer: Neal Fredericks; cast: Heather
Donahue (Heather the director ), Michael Williams (Mike the sound guy),
Joshua Leonard (Josh the cameraman), 1999)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>There is something to be said about simplicity: it is unencumbering. To
shoot a film about a weekend excursion, shot in 16mm and on a high-8
video hand-held camcorder and have it shown in theaters, as the picture
jumps back and forth during the entire film, making it really annoying
to view, and have the audience be understanding about this, means that
this film, shot as if it were a true documentary, has captured something
genuine on screen that an audience is craving for. It also should move
it into cult film status for these 5 Central Florida University film
school students (3 actors,writer and director), who should be proud of
their achievement, accomplished by having a sound idea and made without
hardly any money for its production; the only other thing needed by them
was the conviction to do their own thing and in their own way.</P>
<P>Heather Donahue (Heather the director ), Michael Williams (Mike the
sound guy), Joshua Leonard (Josh the cameraman), play the three young
people on camera who hike through Maryland's dark woods in search of
finding out more about the legend of the Blair Witch
(Elly Kedward, found guilty of sorcery in 1785 and lashed to a tree
during a harsh winter). The film begins by announcing the disappearance
in the woods of "Burkittsville Maryland" of these three documentary
filmmakers in 1994, and the film presents itself as what the camera
shows was left behind after their disappearance. As we watch the footage
from the evidence recovered, we know as much about the legend as the
youngsters knew when they went out on their trek. The horrors come about
when we see how their expressions change from one of horseplay and
showing off their purchases of junk food and the good feelings they have
to one another, to one of real fear and anger with each other. It is the
horror on their faces and the way their expressions show real
apprehension that give this film a different twist to it than the usual
horror story, which, too often, relies on special effects. It matters
not what is seen along the way or how well they are acting, professional
actors could not have done a better job. What is really scary to see, is
how panic stricken they are when they realize they are really lost in
the woods, that they have little chance of getting out on their own and
are in need of a rescue party to find them. This makes the last minute
of the film the most haunting part of it. It sticks with you well after
viewing it, as you wonder what could have happened to them. It reminded
me somewhat of "Picnic at Hanging Rock", that film also effectively left
the disappearance up to the imagination and did not dwell on the details
of the children's demise. This method of filming mysterious
disappearances, proves to be an interesting way of handling it,
especially when you don't have much in your budget and your story is
razor thin.</P>
<P>The flaws in this project are that it was like going on the trek
yourself, walking over bumpy logs, getting wet, and feeling cold and
uncomfortable, and listening to all those snidish remarks and whining
that came out of the three. I would not like to see other films made
this way, or see a follow-up to this film, a film that lucked out and
became an enormous commercial success, which should make "big time"
movie producers drool with envy. This film, just happened to capture the
spirit of the project and was done in a satisfying way so as to reassure
us that we were seeing something that appeared to be genuinely creepy.
Follow-up films rarely capture the same spirit, and by correcting the
jumpy camera would not, necessarily, enhance the film. This film did
what it had to do and should be savored as the popular cult film it is
or will certainly become. It made a virtue out of shooting a low-budget
and unsophisticated story in the raw.</P>
<P>The other thing the film didn't do, was give us enough information about
the legend. I would have felt more toward the effort, if I had more of a
story and some more pertinent dialogue to go along with the scariness of
the film. It was also hard on the ears to hear their conversations, both
because of the poor sound quality and their endless ramblings,
punctuated only by profanity. But this is overwritten by their excellent
use of the forest itself, its twigs (designed to give the film its
terrifying logo) and rocks and darkness, as in one sense the area was
found to be beautiful, but when things went wrong, an ugliness of mood
and environment set in, giving the film all the props they would need to
make this horror film scary. I would give it an A if it was shown to a
film school class and held up as an example of how to make an innovative
film on practically nothing. But as a professional offering, I would be
more critical, and my overall discomfort in watching the film would have
me lower the grade significantly. Though I do heartily recommend this
film for the more adventurous sorts, and feel it is difficult to
evaluate because of the thinness of the story and such, yet it has an
appeal to it that goes beyond what we ordinarily look for in a film.
That something special is what draws us to this film, but not to a point
where we remain uncritical of it.</P>
<P>The film leaves the elements of mystery about it, as its ending is very
much connected to its beginning interview scenes of the locals, which
should provide many provocative responses from the enthusiasts of this
film, who will add mystery onto the mystery for this most dizzying and
engaging film... Incidentally, I did feel like I was motion-sick when I
left the theater. I wonder how many others felt that way!</P>
