<P>     Just when I thought I'd seen every possible spin on the serial killer
thriller, here comes FREQUENCY to show that there is something new under
the sun. The serial killer story in this case is wrapped up in a fantasy
story about a troubled cop named John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel), whose
entire life has been affected by the death of his firefighter dad Frank
(Dennis Quaid) 30 years earlier. But strange atmospheric phenomena are
afoot, and when John pulls out his dad's old ham radio, he manages to pull
in none other than dad himself, chatting from 30 years in the past. John
sees this as an opportunity not just to get to know Frank, but to save his
life with his foreknowledge as well. Unfortunately, one piece of changed
history has a domino effect on other events, including the death of John's
mother Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell) at the hands of -- that's right -- a
serial killer.</P>
<P>     Time-travel tales are inevitably head-scratching affairs if you
ponder them for too long, and FREQUENCY is no exception. It posits a
strange side effect of the father-son communication -- when John
successfully prevents Frank from dying as he had in _his_ past, he is left
the only one who remembers a world in which Frank died in 1969, though he
also finds himself newly-flooded with memories of 30 years of life with
dad. It's an utterly preposterous conceit, of course, but it actually
works. Caviezel never once smirks at the material, resulting in a
performance full of convincingly pent-up emotion. Director Gregory
Hoblit's staging of John's new montage of memory is surprisingly
affecting; Caviezel's work as a man re-discovering his father is better
than you have any reason to expect in a genre film.</P>
<P>     Now, did I mention that this all turns into a serial killer thriller
at some point? Yes, it is soon discovered that saving Frank's life has set
in motion events that will cost Julia hers. Father and son team up across
time to send Frank on a search for the rogue cop (Shawn Doyle) responsible
for a series of murders. Hoblit and screenwriter Toby Emmerich might have
chosen to explore the ramifications of continuing to mess with history,
but that would be a bit too philosophically deep. They're content to set
up a series of neat sequences that show the instantaneous impact of one
decision 30 years earlier on the world of the present. FREQUENCY is a
genuinely snappy piece of film-making, far and away the liveliest work
from Hoblit (who got bogged down in the grim subject matter of PRIMAL FEAR
and FALLEN), even when you're inspired to a round of "yeah, right."</P>
<P>     There's no question that much of FREQUENCY is smart and entertaining,
but it's also a fragmented piece of work. For the first half of the film,
it's a fantasy with a strong human side, anchored by an unconventional but
convincing father-son relationship. In the second hour, it shifts
dramatically to a creep-show, with the sinister killer popping up at
terribly inconvenient times. That makes for some crowd-pleasing chases and
struggles, but a terribly rote plot progression. Though there are still
some well-crafted scenes -- Andre Braugher gets a particularly good one as
a cop friend of Frank's watching a World Series prediction come true --
character ceases to matter for all practical purposes. </P>
<P>     It suddenly matters again in FREQUENCY's achingly sentimental
denouement, which gets all FIELD OF DREAMS on us by tying father-son
connections to baseball. The strange thing is that it probably wouldn't
have felt nearly as overwrought if FREQUENCY had stuck with the tone of
its first half. The shift from character piece to thriller is jarring
enough; the attempt to shift back to character piece feels like an 
unearned piece of manipulation. It's easy to recommend FREQUENCY for the
things it does right in each of its incarnations, but the recommendation
can't be too enthusiastic when those incarnations are so incongruous. I
think there's a reason we've never seen this sort of serial killer
thriller before: It's awfully hard to make a serial killer thriller a
tear-jerker as well.</P>
