<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Former professor from England, Wes Craven, in his second feature (Last
House On The Left), has come up with a stylishly, ironical, scary
thriller filled with nauseating gore and some humorous situations. It's
become a cult-status film, that has staying power as a rather lyrical
horror classic. The slightly dysfunctional WASP Carter family, of seven
vacationers and two ferocious pet dogs, are driving out west to Los
Angeles, California, from their Cleveland home, where they take a
sidetrip off the main desert road to look at an abandoned silver mine
located on a former nuclear Air Force base and upon seeing a rabbit on
the road swerve to avoid hitting it. They snap their car/camper axle and
are stranded in the desert. The civilized family has to fight for
survival in these harsh surroundings with a parallel family of savages.
This opposing family of six, headed by Jupiter (James Whitworth), is a
cave-dwelling cannibal one, who want to destroy and eat them.</P>
<P>It's loosely based on the true story of the Sawney Bean family who
cannibalized strangers in 17th century Scotland.</P>
<P>The film opens as the head of the civilized clan, the surly retired city
policeman, Bob Carter (Russ Grieve), tells the old geezer gas station
attendant (Steadman) to fill it up. The attendant tells them to stay on
the main road there are strange creatures around these parts. But, of
course, this arrogant family doesn't pay him no mind and takes a back
road.</P>
<P>The mother, Ethel (Virginia Vincent), leads them in prayer after their
car mishap, and then the policeman walks for a few hours to get back to
the gas station for help. The attendant tells him that a long time ago
his wife gave birth to a monster, who when he was ten was a full grown
devil-man and burned down the house killing his wife and other little
child. The old man threw him out to fend for himself in the wilds of the
desert and he managed to not only survive, but grew up strong and found
a whore for a wife (Cordy Clark) to raise a family of monsters
consisting of his sons Mars (Lance Gordon), Pluto (Berryman-he plays the
part of the eldest son), and Mercury (Locke). They attack strangers who
get stranded in the desert. Jupiter's daughter Ruby (Janus Blythe)
smells like a horse and stands little chance of fitting into
civilization, but is tired of eating dog meat and wants Grandpa Fred to
help her escape. She will later on rebel against the family to try and
save a baby the family wants to feast on.</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoiler to follow.</PRE>
<P>While policeman Bob is trying to get help at the gas station, his
family, back in the desert, is being watched by the mutants hiding in
the hills; they communicate with each other by CB. The revolting action
takes place on two fronts as one of the dogs, Beauty, is slain and
gutted by the mutants. When the detective's son Bobby (Houston)
discovers this, he's too stupid to warn the other family members: his
spoiled sister Brenda (Lanier), his brother-in-law Doug (Speer) and his
wife Lynne (Dee Wallace), and his religious mother. The young couple
also have an infant daughter Katy (Marinoff).</P>
<P>While the family is experiencing danger at the site where they are
stranded, Bob and Fred are attacked by Jupiter in the gas station. The
action begins to get serious. In the end the Carters lose three family
members in horrible deaths. But before things are resolved, the
following ugly incidents take place: there's a rape, Brenda screams her
head off when seeing the ugly mutants in the camper, the camper is
looted and blown up, someone is burned alive, the baby is kidnapped and
prepared to be served for dinner, the dog called beast pushes one of
Jupiter's sons to his death off the ledge of a cliff, and a combined
rattlesnake poisoning and vicious stabbing death occurs. This last
incident is the violent note on how the film abruptly ends.</P>
<P>The two families are hoots. The film plays as an allegory, and has a
certain strength in its story telling. By the film's end, there's not
much difference between the two families as the fight for survival
brings everyone down to the level of a beast. I guess that's the point
of the film.</P>
