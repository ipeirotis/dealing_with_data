<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>CHOCOLAT by Lasse Hallstrom is a thoroughly manipulative and
indigestible art-house, comedy-drama, fluff film. It sets up a war
between sensualists and those repressed by their religious beliefs.
Every character is a cliché, everything about the story is predictably
smug. It is so easy to make fun of the one-dimensional villains and feel
morally superior to them. I grew nauseous from how bourgeois this film
was in attitude, where even the rebels are merely lovers of sweet
things. I found not much about the film that I enjoyed (though the
cinematography was beguilling and the cast was adept). It was a labor
just to sit through it and not gag, while waiting for the inevitable
preachy sermon that comes at the end, so even the church is redeemed for
its unchristian attitude toward strangers. Lasse Hallstrom has come down
a few pegs after his more engaging recent films "My Life as a Dog" and
"The Cider House Rules," as he couldn't pull this fairy tale off without
being tainted by the mediocrity of it all. This film got nominated for
an Oscar as best picture, which should show you what kind of films
Hollywood falls in love with.</P>
<P>Set in 1959, in a small traditional medieval French village, where the
centerpiece of the town is the church and the town's nobleman mayor,
Comte De Reynaud (Alfred Molina), who is their guiding force to
righteousness. He is the one who makes sure everyone knows their moral
place. Tranquility and resistance to change are the only mood swings of
this unchanging town. Into this serene but rigid climate, when the north
wind was blowing, come two drifters in red-hooded coats, Vianne
(Binoche) and her school-aged, illegitimate daughter Anouk (Thivisol).
They rent a shabby apartment across from the church from a cranky old
woman, Armande Voizin (Judi Dench).</P>
<P>Hoping to win over the locals, Vianne, who is an atheist, opens up a
specialty chocolate shop, but unfortunately she opens up during Lent,
and from the pulpit, the newly arrived, Père Henri (Hugh O' Conor),
reluctantly but slavishly follows the dictates of the repressed mayor
and warns the parishioners against yielding to temptation. So a war
ensues between the pleasure seekers and the followers of the church,
with the mayor's aim being to get her to close her shop before Easter.</P>
<P>The shop is painted over in bright pastel colors and when Armande sees
what the decor  has become, she cleverly states that it's like a
"Mexican brothel." But Vianne can bake some extraordinary sweets and
soon exerts a sensual influence over some of the townspeople, whom she
lures into the shop with free samples and her friendly gestures.</P>
<P>Her magical chocolates bring sexual pleasure to one couple previously
having an empty sexual life and an elderly man (John Wood) uses her
chocolates as a present to an elderly widow he always admired (Leslie
Caron), but was too timid to let her know that. Miraculously her
chocolates get the despondent Armande to meet her artistic-minded young
grandson (Aurelien Parent Koenig) in the chocolate shop, who must obey
his widowed mother's (Carrie-Anne Moss) wishes not to see her because
she thinks Armande is a bad influence on him, reading dirty books and
being a free thinker, but he can't resist having his grandmother pose
for her portrait. Vianne will make friends and teach a very troubled
woman how to make chocolates, who initially steals from her, Josephine
(Lena Olin), the long-suffering wife of the town's abusive cafe owner
Serge (Peter Stormare).</P>
<P>The film drags on for an hour setting up how these uninteresting figures
battle their natural temptations and all the repression they have been
burdened with all their lives, before the arrival of the 'River Rats,' a
guitar-strumming boat crew of gypsies, led by the Irish accented Roux
(Pitt), invigorates the films with some more clichés of rebels. They are
also strangers the church will turn its anger towards as moral sinners.
The moral war led by the mayor intensifies, and a near fatal tragedy is
narrowly averted by luck, after the mayor's strong words to the piggish
Serge, that something must be done about these strangers, brings about
the burning down of their boats. These events cause Vianne to give up on
the town and want to leave, but something happens that pulls the town
magically back to its senses and they all undergo a change of spirit and
become more tolerant and better people. This contrived turn-around was
just too much for me to digest without getting sick from all the sugar I
was taking in.</P>
