<P>     I feel like I've just taken a time trip back to the '80s.  Remember 
when slasher films were all the rage, and each year brought forth the 
dreaded specter of another FRIDAY THE 13TH, HALLOWEEN, and/or A 
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (not to mention such other, notable titles as 
PROM NIGHT and SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT)?  Well, they're back again, 
and stronger than ever.  SCREAM started this recent wave, and its $100+ 
million box office gross has ensured a host of sequels and inferior 
copycats.  THE WISHMASTER was arguably the first.  I KNOW WHAT YOU DID 
LAST SUMMER, brought to the screen by neophyte director Jim Gillespie, 
is the second, and there are many more to come.</P>
<P>     I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER bears almost all the hallmarks of a 
classic slasher movie.  The large-breasted female protagonist does some 
incredibly dumb things.  Most of her friends get killed before the final 
reel.  Every character is strictly one-dimensional -- there's no desire 
or attempt to form anything resembling a full-fledged personality out of 
any of these cardboard stereotypes.  There's plenty of blood and gore 
(although, to be fair, one could argue that it's restrained here).  The 
only thing that's missing are flashes of female flesh.  Gratuitous 
nudity was always big in the '80s films.  Apparently, that's no longer 
the case.</P>
<P>     Of course, the killer has to be dressed in some kind of costume -- 
that's a slasher movie requisite.  In HALLOWEEN, Michael Myers donned 
the featureless Captain Kirk mask.  In FRIDAY THE 13TH, we had the 
hockey goalie motif.  In SCREAM, it was the Grim Reaper.  So what face 
of terror do we have in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER?  The Gorton's 
Fisherman.  That's right -- rain slicker, hat, and all.  I kept 
expecting to hear the theme song playing in the background.</P>
<P>     The screenwriter of I SAW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is Kevin 
Williamson, who made a name for himself by penning SCREAM.  Those two 
movies give him a unique distinction.  With I SAW WHAT YOU DID LAST 
SUMMER, he has now written a film of the very type that his other script 
parodied.  SCREAM had a lot of fun playing with ideas, conventions, and 
approaches that I SAW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER takes very seriously.  
And the genuine scares of SCREAM have mostly been replaced by silly, 
repetitive shock tactics (one exception:  a creepy cat-and-mouse game in 
a department store).  This points out the main weakness of I SAW WHAT 
YOU DID LAST SUMMER.  The characters aren't interesting enough for us to 
be scared for them.  Who cares if they live or die?  They just add to 
the body count, and everyone knows that the really good slasher movies 
have inordinately high death rates.</P>
<P>     The story sounds more interesting that it is.  Four friends just 
out of high school -- Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen (Sarah 
Michelle Gellar), Barry (Ryan Phillippe), and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.) -
- are out celebrating late one July 4 night when they have a little 
accident.  On a dark, twisting stretch of highway, with Ray at the 
wheel, their car slams into a man and kills him.  Panic-stricken, they 
elect to dump him in the sea rather than report the accident.  They 
apparently get away with it, but one year later, someone begins stalking 
them, and they have to wonder whether an unseen observer saw what they 
did or whether their victim was really dead after all.  Regardless of 
the truth, whoever is after them now is in deadly earnest, and, for 
Julie, it's a race against time to learn the killer's identity before he 
uses his fish hook on her.</P>
<P>     I wasn't dazzled by any of the acting in this film, but it's rare 
that a slasher movie is characterized by Oscar-caliber performances.  
The male actors, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze Jr., were likely 
chosen because they represent two different types of hunks.  The women, 
Jennifer Love Hewitt (of PARTY OF FIVE) and Sarah Michelle Gellar (TV's 
BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER), appear to have been selected because they 
share two crucial assets:  impressive cleavage and an even more 
impressive set of pipes.  Boy, can they scream! (And they're given 
endless opportunities to prove it.)</P>
<P>     There is one minor aspect of the plot that elevates I SAW WHAT YOU 
DID LAST SUMMER above the level of a typical '80s slasher flick -- it 
has an interesting subtext.  I'm referring to the way the lives and 
friendships of these four individuals crumble in the wake of their 
accident.  Guilt, confusion, and doubt build in them until they can no 
longer stand to be with each other or look at themselves in the mirror.  
Sadly, this potentially-fascinating element of the movie is dismissed 
quickly to facilitate a higher body count.  And, as I said before, a few 
extra deaths can only make a slasher movie better, right?  </P>
