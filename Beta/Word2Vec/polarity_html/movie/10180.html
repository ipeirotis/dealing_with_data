<PRE>CARLITO'S WAY (1993)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Brian De Palma
Writer: David Koepp (based on the novels "Carlito's Way" and "After
Hours" by Edwin Torres)
Starring: Al Pacino, Sean Penn, Penelope Ann Miller, John Leguiziamo,
Luis Guzman, John Rebhorn, Viggio Mortensen, Jorge Porcel</P>
<P>What's shocking about "Carlito's Way" is how good it is.  Having gotten
a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like Pacino's
previous film, "Scent of a Woman," and not having as strong a
performance as he did in that one (he had just won an Oscar), "Carlito's
Way" was destined for underrated heaven.  That's what it is: an
underrated gem of a movie.  And what a shame because Pacino and De Palma
both do amazing jobs with it, and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy
character study.</P>
<P>"Carlito's Way" deals with, well, Carlito Brigante (Pacino), a Puerto
Rican ex-drug kingpin, who gets out of a long jailterm when his
coke-addicted, curly-haired lawyer (Sean Penn) points out a legal
technicality.  Of course, Carlito was actually awoken in prison, and has
decided to go straight, even if he's really a crook at heart.  Carlito,
like Barry Lyndon, is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn, and
can't escape into something he is not.</P>
<P>Carlito's attempts at a clean, legal life are thwarted at nearly every
turn.  When he first gets out, a friend of his ends up leading him into
a big shoot-out, where he has to kill a couple people to survive.  He's
constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he's doing
anything illegal, and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of
shit, needing him to try and help him out, which includes him doing some
prison breaking.</P>
<P>Carlito, like Ratso Rizzo, wants to go to Miami (since, according to
film logic, that's where it's at), but needs some funding.  Being a
legend, he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club
(this is the 70s, by the way, and since some of this takes place in
night clubs, we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics, including several
K.C. and the Sunshine Band tunes - my personal favorite).  He gets a
bodyguard (the great Luis Guzman, at his best), and is soon running a
pretty good business, even if he's constantly attracting underworld
young thugs, like Benny Blanco "from the Bronx" (John Leguiziamo), who
is more than once pointed out to be a young version of Carlito.</P>
<P>On the other side, the symbol of promise and hope, is Gail (Penelope Ann
Miller - what happened to her?), his girlfriend from before prison. 
She's a goregeous ballerina, and a stripper, and soon Carlito is trying
to get back with her, and take her with him when he finally leaves for
Miami.  While this relationship is never fully defined or anything, we
get a sense of love between them, and they have some truly interesting
scenes between them (she never gives him addresses or locales - he
always has to track her down).</P>
<P>All of these elements clash together at the end, in a brilliantly
executed, emotional climax, which is inevitable.  When I say inevitable,
I mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack, putting a great
spin on it.  Sure, it's going to eleveate some of the tension, but it
gives the film a lot of depth, as Carlito is seen trapped by fate. 
What's amazing is the big chase sequence (amazingly done by De Palma)
has a lot of tension and thrills.  Like "Apollo 13," we know what's
going to happen, but we're still thrilled by what happens in the
middle.  It's also very emotional, thanks to a great script by David
Koepp, and amazing performances by Pacino and Miller.</P>
<P>De Palma is famous (or infamous) for lots of violence in his films.  His
earlier flim, "Scarface" (which starred Pacino in the lead), has a ton
of it, especially at the end (and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the
beginning which I'm still not over).  But De Palma actually reigns in
more quieter scenes.  To me, the best scene in the film is when Carlito
is on top of a building, looking down into the room where Gail is doing
ballet.  This is the most brilliantly done, and most emotionally
stimulating scene in the entire film, and probably the best in De Palma
film history.  With a gorgeous soprano duet in the background, and rain
pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering Carlito's head, and a
saddened, remorseful look on Pacino's face, it's a tear-jerker (well,
for me, I dunno about you...).</P>
<P>The acting from all is great, especially from the three leads.  Pacino
was panned for his performance, chiefly because his accent wasn't Puerto
Rican enough and, well, it wasn't as "strong" as his Oscar-winning role
in "Scent of a Woman."  Well, his "Scent of a Woman" performance was
great and all, but it was nothing really but, as comic Kevin Pollack
said, a "Foghorn Leghorn impression."  In "Carlito's Way," he's
emotional, and strong, despite the fact that he's remorseful over his
entire lifestyle, which he cannot change.  I felt more for Carlito
Brigante than I did for the tango-dancing, insult-throwing blind guy in
"Scent of a Woman."</P>
<P>As I said, Penelope Ann Miller is great, and she and Pacino actually
have very good chemistry.  And they're scenes are well-written, with
some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland
relationship.  And Sean Penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat
attorney.  Every scene he's in, he has great energy, and even measures
up to the greatness that is Pacino.  In smaller roles, John Leguiziamo
and Luis Guzman are great.</P>
<P>"Carlito's Way" is one of those films which you heard about briefly, but
when you finally watch it, you're absolutely blown away.  It's a
wonderful film, a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved
after it didn't do so hot.  But trust me and check it out.  It's a great
little film, and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are
not always right.</P>
