<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>What does loneliness mean to a 43-year-old plain looking widow, who is
having an affair for the last 5 years with a married man, with two
children? Katalin Berek as Kata Csentes, has this most absorbing and
self-conscious role, of a woman who is in love with such a man, troubled
by the secrecy of the relationship and that she doesn't have a child.
She gets a check-up to see if she is in good health to have a baby, but
is disappointed that her lover, Joska (Szabó), refuses to make her
pregnant, even if she wants to raise the child without him.</P>
<P>She lives comfortably in a pleasant house, not worried over financial
matters due to her secure job in the factory, where she is a skilled
worker, a trade she learned from her father who was a joiner. Nearby is
an orphanage for delinquent girls. One day a group of these girls visit
her unannounced. A relationship is struck up with one of the troubled
girls, a very attractive brunette, Anna Balint (Gyöngyvér), who
befriends the independent-minded Kata, asking her if she could use one
of the spare rooms in the house to make love to her boyfriend Senyi
(Péter Fried). Kata is put off by this, but is interested in the girl
and continues to develop an unlikely friendship with someone she really
can't understand, but feels very close to.</P>
<P>The most perceptive thing Anna tells her, when she refuses Kata's offer
of adoption, is that abandoned children are all wounded and difficult
children to manage. It seems obvious, but it is the most pivotal point
of the film. To show that she meant what she said, after a trust begins
to grow between the two, Anna pretends to be crying and when Kata goes
over to comfort her, she is greeted by Anna's laughter. When Kata slaps
her, Anna indignantly replies that she has been hit enough in her
lifetime and doesn't need another parent now. The film relates to the
bleakness of Hungarian society, its unwillingness to change its ways,
and the emptiness of life- and how it is up to young people to change
the future for themselves, because the older generation is too set in
their ways. The sounds heard from the factory or the music in the
background, signal the extremes of pleasure and pain felt. The romantic
maudlin Gypsy music that opens the film, is followed by the oppressive
factory sounds- a source of confinement and class differences.</P>
<P>Sympathetic with Anna's plight, Kata meddles in her affairs, going to
the Home and speaking with the head about helping Anna get married to
this 22-year-old, gentle boy, who wants so much to marry her. The only
ones opposing the marriage for the underage girl, is her parents, whom
she detests. The head of the Home cannot approve of the marriage without
the parents permission. On her own, Kata arranges a meeting with the
parents, with the boyfriend present, which results in an agreement
worked out between them that stipulates that even if they get divorced,
it would be up to his parents to provide a home for Anna. The
threatening bark of a caged dog greets them on entering and leaving this
hostile house, where Anna was a neglected child and became a whore,
something the parents don't want to blame themselves for.</P>
<P>The most telling and troubling scene, is at Anna's wedding, where the
gay music is not received well by many of the girl guests from the Home,
whose sad expressions mirror Anna's change in mood, as she rebuffs her
husband's hot kisses and stands off alone in the corner to sulk, as the
husband walks away from her in disgust.</P>
<P>Kata is seen leaving the Home with the baby she just adopted and
boarding the bus to take her home. It is not a very optimistic ending
for a film that touches on subjects that are not very comfortable areas
for discussion. The film, in the social realism mode of many Eastern
European films, is lighter than most films of this ilk, but what it
can't overcome is the total bleakness of its subject matter and how too
many of its responses must be considered as clichés to a Western
audience. Nevertheless, this is a powerful and well made film, and the
performance of Katalin Berek, in a role where she defies social
conventions but who must be someone that the audience can empathize
with, is handled with a quiet dignity and aplomb. The entire ensemble
cast is well suited to bring off this drama in a successful way, making
one wonder, that even when the bureaucrats are seen as benevolent and
people are finally sympathetic to a young girl's plight, life is still
difficult. And for the middle-age Kata, life is so unjust, that even her
well intentioned gestures might not be enough to overcome the
problematic nature of a country that seems to be stuck in its own
malaise.</P>
