<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This parody of other gangster films suffers from a bad case of mindless
imitation and hapless comedy that might be funny to someone in Japan,
but does not have a universal appeal. It is a parody of how the yakuza
is portrayed in Kitano films. It also pays homage to many other gangster
films from around the world, including France's "Diva." It tries to take
dramatic situations that occurred in those films and apply them out of
context here, by poking fun at the hit man's mystique.</P>
<P>What the director Sabu is trying to do becomes apparent in one of the
early scenes, where
a postman Sawaki (Tsutsumi ) goes to deliver mail to his old high school
friend Noguchi (Horibe), someone he hasn't seen for years. Noguchi has
become a low-level yakuza with dreams of becoming infamous, expressing
exhilaration for the work he has chosen to do, even if he couldn't
possibly be overjoyed at the present since he just cut off his pinky to
give to his yakuza boss for screwing up a drug deal. Sawaki when asked
about his work, just feels his job is dull. Noguchi asks him, "Does your
heart ever thump with excitement like it did when you were a kid?"</P>
<P>The police have Noguchi under surveillance and since the postman went
into the yakuza's apartment, they assume he is working for the gangster
as a messenger and thereby put a tail on him. The film will turn into an
absurd action comedy of mistaken identity, as Sawaki is taken for a
drug-runner, then when he delivers mail in a hospital and talks with a
cancer victim, Hit Man Joe (Ren), the police think he is involved in an
insurance scam, then they think he a terrorist bomber because he is
always delivering packages, and finally, they bring in a criminal
profiler, and Sawaki is classified as being a serial homicidal
psychopath. By searching his apartment and finding a severed finger
there, which Sawaki took by mistake from his friend's apartment, and
then following him to meet Noguchi, who has to cut off another to please
his boss -- the cops from this task force surveillance team become
convinced that he is a serial killer connected with the Minato Gang. The
cops are shown to be bumbling idiots, while the yakuzas are clichés of
how they appear in films. The fun in the film is mainly for film buffs,
who will spot a wide variety of gangster films being used as a source
for the levity here.</P>
<P>A conventional soap opera romance is thrown into the mix, as the kindly
mailman not only meets Hit Man Joe at the hospital but a beautiful young
lady called Kyoto, who has a terminal case of cancer. The two dream that
they can find bliss together as lovers. While Hit Man Joe dreams that he
can win a hit man Killer of Killers competition, but he is worried they
will disqualify him for health reasons.</P>
<P>The film's conclusion is a mixture of madcap comedy and an attempt to
give meaning to all the lives of the dreamers who befriended Sawaki. The
postman is racing on his bike to meet Kyoto at the hospital, while the
special task force under detective Domon's direction have high-tech
computer graphics to follow the suspect and roadblocks in place to
detain the mailman, and are poised to shoot Sawaki first and ask
questions later. Hit Man Joe and Noguchi are shown to have more feeling
than the police and go by bike to aid their unsuspecting friend from the
danger he is in, trying to tell the police they got the wrong man. Sabu
reveals his pessimistic opinion of society, by having the innocent
postman put through such an ordeal over nothing.</P>
<P>Humor is subjective, you can't convince anyone that something was funny
when they aren't laughing. I didn't laugh at what I was seeing, though I
found the film to be stylish, shot in an outpouring of mellow brown and
blue-gray shades.</P>
