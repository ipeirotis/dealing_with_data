<P>     In Patrice Leconte's (THE HAIRDRESSER'S HUSBAND) RIDICULE, the pen 
-- or rather the word -- is truly mightier than the sword.  In late 18th 
century France, before the advent of the guillotine, wit was used as 
often for pain and humiliation as it was for pleasure.  Those who had 
mastered the art of ridicule could, with one turn of phrase, strip a 
less adept opponent of pride and position, hurling him from the pampered 
confines of Louis XVI's court into the hostile world beyond, where 
indignities and possibly death awaited.</P>
<P>     RIDICULE is not meant to be taken as a rigorous historical account, 
but, as with all French movies, the period detail is impeccable.  The 
general atmosphere, if not the specifics, reflects 1783 Versailles, 
where a witty conversationalist was greatly prized as a source of 
entertainment, and where those with a gift for bon mots could attain a 
position of importance at the king's court (especially if their lineage 
connected them to a respected bloodline).</P>
<P>     Gregoire Ponceludon de Malavoy (Charles Berling), a baron from the 
rural province of Dombes, comes to Versailles to obtain money for an 
ambitious engineering scheme that would drain southwest France's swamps 
to reduce disease and pestilence.  Ponceludon entertains a hope that the 
king, known to be intrigued by science, might take an interest in the 
project and offer to fund it.  However, what he discovers at Versailles 
disheartens him -- a corrupt rulership that prizes wit and pedigree over 
all other qualifications.  Gaining an audience with the king has more to 
do with one's ancestors, bedpartners, and verbal agility than with the 
merits of one's proposal.</P>
<P>     Undeterred, Ponceludon finds a local sponsor, Bellegarde (Jean 
Rochefort), who sees promise in the idealistic newcomer and offers 
lessons of how to survive in Versailles ("Don't laugh with your mouth 
open", "We call puns the death of wit", "The soul of wit is to know 
one's place").  While the young nobleman is learning the rules of 
acceptable court behavior, he falls for Bellegarde's beautiful, young 
daughter, Mathilde (Judith Godreche).  But, when Ponceludon's would-be 
romance with Mathilde flounders because of her impending marriage of 
convenience to a much older man, he seeks the sexual (and political) 
favors of Madame de Blayac (Fanny Ardant), a fixture at court who 
consorts with all the finest wits.  Ponceludon then becomes involved in 
a series of contests with the appropriately-named Vilecourt (Bernard 
Giraudeau) to see whose wit is the most corrosive.</P>
<P>     The humor in RIDICULE, such as it is, is exceptionally savage.  
Leconte and screenwriter Remi Waterhouse have not designed this film to 
offer inconsequential laughs.  As in DANGEROUS LIAISONS, there's 
calculated malice behind each barbed riposte.  But, while nearly every 
comic aspect of RIDICULE is mean-spirited, it's difficult not to 
appreciate the intelligence behind the most vicious strikes. </P>
<P>     RIDICULE is not just the tale of a decaying, degraded empire of 
favoritism, although that is certainly an element of the plot.  In 
addition, this film illustrates the power of language both to build and 
to tear down.  It is also about choices.  Ponceludon's own moral dilemma 
-- to retain his purity and reject court or to embrace the place by the 
king's side that his skill for ridicule can gain him -- is personified 
by the two women who want him:  the sweet, independent Mathilde and the 
seductive, manipulative Madame de Blayac.  </P>
<P>     The cast is superlative, with Charles Berling (NELLY AND M. 
ARNAUD), Fanny Ardant (COLONEL CHABERT), and Jean Rochefort (THE 
HAIRDRESSER'S HUSBAND) turning in impressive performances.  As 
RIDICULE's chief villain, Bernard Giraudeau (PASSION D'AMORE) savors all 
his nastiest lines, delivering them with relish.  And, even though many 
aspects of Mathilde's character are anachronistic (she's a bit too 
modern to fit seamlessly into the time period), Judith Godreche is a 
beguiling asset.</P>
<P>     Clocking in at about one-hundred minutes, Leconte's film is 
tightly-plotted and well-paced, with few wasted or unnecessary scenes.  
The script does have lapses, such as a sequence that uses a conventional 
duel to generate unnecessary tension and uncertainty, but, on the whole, 
the writing is RIDICULE's greatest asset.  The carefully-rendered 
French-to-English subtitles do justice to the sparkling dialogue, making 
the verbal matches between Ponceludon, Madame de Blayac, and Vilecourt 
one of RIDICULE's highlights.  For those who appreciate movies with a 
bite, RIDICULE shows its teeth early and keeps them razor-sharp 
throughout.</P>
