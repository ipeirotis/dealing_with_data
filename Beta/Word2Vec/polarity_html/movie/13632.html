<PRE>THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY
RATING:  7 / 10 --> Good movie</PRE>
<P>The Farrelly Brothers' third film, after DUMB AND DUMBER (7.5/10) and
KINGPIN (8/10), brings together the real-life couple of Cameron Diaz
and Matt Dillon, some nasty humour, a cute dog, and a mix of love, fate
and romance.</P>
<P>PLOT:
High-school nerd Ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks
him to the prom. Unfortunately for Ted, he accidentally gets a part of
his male anatomy (ouch!) caught in his zipper, and misses the big
night. Thirteen years later, Ted still can't get Mary out of his mind,
and hires a private detective (Dillon) to find her. Once found, it
turns out that Mary has more than one suitor, and that's when the real
fun begins.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes, some funny looking
people, and a plot that won't ever put you to sleep. Having said that,
I must admit that I did like the Farrellys' two previous films more
than this one, but that is saying a lot, since I really did love those
earlier pics. This one is also quite funny, but it didn't really blow
me away like the others. Then again, maybe my expectations were too
high. Then again, maybe I should shut up, and write a little more about
the film, and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for
liking/disliking the film.</P>
<P>Continuing where their other pictures left off, the Farrellys' create a
cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities, and a
simple plot by which to tie them all together. This one also includes
plenty of toilet humour, but also some borderline fun-making of the
disabled and mentally-challenged. I must admit that I really wasn't
sure whether to laugh at some points or not. Not a good place to be.
Having said that, the scenes that did tear through the audience, and
yours truly, were extremely hilarious, and went on for several minutes
after the punchline. The laughter practically killed out the next scene
for one of the best ones in the movie (something to do with hair gel).</P>
<P>On the negative end, I did not like the musical interludes of Jonathan
Richman that ran through the entire picture. I found them quite
useless, unfunny and distracting. Also, I found that a lot of the
funnier scenes had already been shown in the film's trailer. And of
course, I never quite buy the fact that these beautiful, intelligent,
single women still can't seem to find the "right guy" (see KISS THE
GIRLS (7/10). I did really like all of the actors in the film,
especially Ben Stiller, who appears to be solidifying his mark as a
great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from
1996, FLIRTING WITH DISASTER (8/10). I also liked Matt Dillon with his
big teeth, and Lee Evans with his superb faux-sympathy British accent.
Funny stuff. Also, make sure that you stay for the credits, because
there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a
lip-synched version of "Build me up buttercup", which is really cool.
Overall, a cute comedy with a decent premise, and a few particularly
hilarious scenes.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts: 
The Farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their
script "Dust to Dust" into the hands of Eddie Murphy via  Murphy's
neighbour. They only found out about Murphy's interest, when they saw
Eddie mention the script on the David Letterman show one night.
Matt Dillon is a high school dropout. In between acting gigs, Dillon
has branched out into the restaurant business. Close to home in his
native New York, he co-owns both a bar called the Whiskey and a swanky
uptown eatery called the Falls.
Cameron Diaz stands 5"9, started working as a model at the early age of
16, and loves cats.
Ben Stiller's father is Jerry Stiller. He played George Costanza's
(Jason Alexander) father on TV's "Seinfeld".
Peter Farrelly has written a novel entitled "Outside Providence" which
is currently being filmed starring Alec Baldwin.
Rob Moran, who plays the cop in this film, also played the millionaire
bowler in KINGPIN, and the bartender in DUMB AND DUMBER. He is old
friends with the Farrelly Brothers from College, and is currently
married to Entertainment Tonight anchor/correspondant Julie Moran.
Harland Williams, who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film, also
played a state trooper in the Farrelly's earlier DUMB AND DUMBER, and
was the star of the unfortunate ROCKET MAN.</P>
