<PRE>                                 THE DRUNKEN MASTER
                       A film review by Christopher E. Meadows
                        Copyright 1997 Christopher E. Meadows</PRE>
<P>Directed by Yuen Woo Ping
Starring Jackie Chan, Hwang Jang Lee, Simon Yuen, Dean Shek</P>
<P>MPAA: Not Rated (though I feel it would likely be PG, for martial-arts
violence.)</P>
<PRE>My Rating: 8/10 (**** out of *****)</PRE>
<P>With three movies already (re)released theatrically in America, and at
least three more on their way, Jackie Chan is one of the newest "hot
properties" in action adventure stardom, and it's just about time.
For over twenty-five years, Jackie's been starring in martial arts and
action movies in Hong Kong, thrilling audiences with both an
incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense
of comedy. </P>
<P>"Drunken Master" has the distinction of being the first Jackie Chan
movie to "make it big"--this is the movie that supposedly set Jackie
up for big stardom in Hong Kong.  I'm not entirely sure why, exactly.
In many ways, "Drunken Master" is similar to most of Jackie's other
early films, such as "Fearless Hyena" I and II, "Master With Cracked
Fingers", "Half a Loaf of Kung Fu", "Spiritual Kung Fu", and others.
In fact, looking at all these early films together, one gets the
impression that they were stamped out, cookie-cutter style, at a rate
of four to six per year, all using the same casts and telling very
similar stories. </P>
<P>To be honest, I think that early Jackie Chan movies are something of
an acquired taste.  They're quite different from action movies as we
know them in America.  These films tend to be set in the Chinese
countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past,
with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes
seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight
scenes together.  "Drunken Master", though its plot is tighter than
some, is no exception. </P>
<P>(As an aside, "Drunken Master" was the first Jackie Chan movie I ever
saw, and I saw it the way it was meant to be seen...in a movie theater
in Seattle, as part of an Asian film festival.  At the time, I didn't
really think it was anything special...but after having seen more
films like it, it's kind of grown on me.)</P>
<P>"Drunken Master"'s storyline is very similar to that of other early
Jackie Chan movies, such as "Fearless Hyena" I and II and "Master With
Cracked Fingers"--slacker martial arts student is taught the martial
arts by a harsh-seeming master, and has a big fight with an evil bad
guy in the end (a formula that has been "adapted," to put it kindly,
by American films such as Karate Kid).  More specifically, Jackie Chan
plays the part of Wong Fei-Hong, aka "Naughty Panther," a fun-loving,
practical-joking Kung Fu student who is too good at Kung Fu for his
own good, but not _quite_ good enough. </P>
<P>After embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly,
then beating up a bully in a marketplace, Wong Fei-Hong tries to hit
on a pretty girl, but discovers that she, and her mother, can hit
back, better than he can...and is further chagrinned to discover that
the two women are his cousin and aunt, respectively.  His father, Wong
Kei-Ying, is unhappy about this, and is further annoyed when the
father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages.  Kei-Ying
soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment, which Fei-Hong does not
like at all. </P>
<P>While escaping from this punishment, Fei-Hong meets up with a drunken
old man, who proceeds to thrash him soundly, then take him on as a
student and thrash him some more.  This turns out to be Su Hua-Chi, a
legendary master of drunken-style Kung Fu.  He assigns Fei-Hong a
series of bizarre tasks, such as filling jugs with water while hanging
upside down from a frame, cracking walnuts with his hands, and other
such exercises, that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually
strengthening him up.  Then, when he's ready, he teaches him the seven
styles of drunken Kung Fu.  Unfortunately, the lazy Fei-Hong only
practices six of them... </P>
<P>"Drunken Master" features some wonderful martial arts sequences, with
Jackie winning some fights and losing others.  It's been said before,
but I'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_, they're as
carefully choreographed as any ballet performance, and it shows.  In
his fights, Jackie often makes use of objects found in his
environment-- benches, jugs, cups, bowls, fruits and vegetables--often
in new and surprising ways.  The fight scenes, particularly those
toward the end of the film, are unparallelled in most American films.
Whether Jackie wins or loses, it's really something to see...and it's
often as funny as anything, too. </P>
<P>And funny is the other thing Jackie Chan is very, very good at.
There's very little that's new in this movie--Jackie winning fights,
Jackie getting beaten badly by a master, Jackie going through
punishment or training...these schticks have all been seen before, in
any one of several dozen similar Jackie movies from the seventies and
early eighties.  But they're still hilarious as ever.  Likewise,
Jackie has a _great_ supporting cast, many of whom were also in other
early Jackie films, and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity
on their own. </P>
<P>The really big thing about "Drunken Master", though, that inspired
several copycats (including a couple starring Jackie himself) and a
sequel fifteen years later, was the drunken-style Kung Fu.  I'm not
certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of Kung Fu,
but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a
drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security...and it
apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it. </P>
<P>Genuine or not, I have to admit, there's just something incredibly fun
about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group
of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they
even realize what's going on.  Come to think of it, perhaps this
element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other
Jackie films...it's not just martial arts, it's the kind of martial
arts that makes you stop and go, "Whoa..."</P>
<P>On the negative side, the cinematography in this film is nothing
special, the film stock is rather primitive, the plot is often rather
slow, and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against
the background.  "Gone With the Wind", this isn't.  Still, if you like
martial arts films, or like what you've seen so far of Jackie Chan and
want to see more, give it a shot.  It's much more "real" than Chuck
Norris or Jean-Claude Van Damme.  You might very well like it. </P>
<P>Another interesting thing about "Drunken Master" has to do with its
video availability in the US.  "Drunken Master" is the only early
Jackie Chan movie that I know of that you can find in its original,
letterboxed, Hong Kong subtitled form, commercially available on VHS
(from Magnum Video, in a gold box, for about $10).  There are plenty
of other early Jackie films around, but these are typically either in
dubbed, pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental
instead of purchase.  Thankfully, "Drunken Master", at least, is
available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen, at a
very affordable price. </P>
<P>If you like "Drunken Master", take a look at the numerous other early
Jackie Chan films that are out there (even the dubbed ones aren't
really _too_ bad...if nothing else, you can enjoy the martial arts
choreography while making fun of the dialogue).  I particularly
recommend "Spiritual Kung Fu", "Half a Loaf of Kung Fu", the "Fearless
Hyena" movies, and "Snake & Crane Arts of Shaolin".  Also, the
mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel, "Drunken Master II", will hit
theaters in American release sometime later this year (though what its
American-release title will be is still uncertain) and comes _highly_
recommended by this reviewer. </P>
<P>Also, for a rather different interpretation of the character Wong
Fei-Hong (who is in fact a popular figure from Chinese folklore), I've
been told to suggest the "Once Upon a Time In China" series starring
Jet Li (though I haven't personally seen any of them yet). </P>
<P>If you choose to watch "Drunken Master", I really hope you enjoy it,
and I hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of Asian
cinema that's out there.  All in all, I give this film an 8 out of 10.</P>
