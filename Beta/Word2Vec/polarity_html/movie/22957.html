<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Bart Tare (John Dall) has always been obsessed with the love of guns. He
was raised by his older sister Ruby (Anabel), who bought him his first
BB gun as a child. On a rainy night in the small-town in the southwest
he lives in, the 14-year-old Bart (Russ Tamblyn) sees a beautiful gun in
a hardware store window and smashes the window with a rock to get it,
but he is caught by the sheriff (Trevor) when he stumbles in a puddle.
The judge (Carnovsky) sends him to reform school, despite Ruby's plea
for mercy, bringing up the point that he was raised without a father
figure. He stays for four years there and then he joins the army. Other
than that incident, Bart has shown no tendency for violence or breaking
the law, he just feels good when he's shooting a gun, something he is an
expert in. He feels compelled to always have a gun, as it makes him feel
important. But in this expressionist-like opening scene, it is shown
that Bart will have little chance of overcoming his obsession. There is
even one point in the robbery where he stretches his arms out
Christ-like, in a symbolic gesture of what is to come of the naive child
as he reaches adulthood.</P>
<P>Returning home for the first-time since he was sent away to reform
school, he meets again his childhood buddies, David Allister (Young),
who is now a newspaper reporter, and Clyde Boston (Paul), who is now a
sheriff, like his father, the one who arrested him. They both thought
the army would have been a natural place for him to make a career in,
but he tells them he got bored with showing soldiers how to fire a gun
and plans to look for work with Remington.</P>
<P>The boys decide to go to a travelling carnival that is in town that
night and when an Annie Oakley-type shooter from England, Annie Laurie
Starr (Cummins), challenges anyone in the audience to a pistol-shooting
contest, Bart accepts the challenge and wins. She talks her boss, a
sleazy carnival operator, Packy (Berry) into hiring him, as the two fall
in love on first sight. The intimacy that grows between the two
infuriates Packy, who has his eyes on Laurie, holding over-her-head the
knowledge that she killed someone in a St. Louis robbery, telling her he
will go to the police if she doesn't continue to give him sex. When he
grapples with her, Bart fires his gun at him and the two are fired. He
decides to marry her that night, even though he was warned by a clown
(Prager) at the carnival that he doesn't know anything about women-that
she's a bad one.</P>
<P>It now becomes a road movie of a crime spree, or a love-on-the run film.
Laurie demands the need for action and money, threatening to leave him
if he can't live up to her expectations. He has fallen so much in love
with her, that even though it isn't in his gentle nature to be a
criminal, he goes along with her robbery schemes. They rob their hotel,
a liquor store, and a gas station, but she wants more money. For another
of their robberies, they carefully come up with a more developed scheme,
as she hitches a ride from an older gentleman visiting California from
Illinois (Beddoe) who is suggestively coming on to her, while the
conversation takes place, she, in a casual manner pulls her pistol out
of her purse and steals his Cadillac, using it for their next robbery so
the cops can't get their real license plates, as they bound him in their
car on the roadside. The robbery takes place in Hampton, where they rob
the local bank dressed in their showbiz cowboy outfits and escape when
she conks the policeman (Osterloh) who is standing in front of the bank,
karate-style on the neck, knocking him out. The getaway scene is
dramatically filmed from the backseat of their car. The crimes become
very sexually stimulating to them, as she becomes more and more
passionate with Bart, even as their escape is taking place.</P>
<P>After another harrowing robbery, their pictures appear in the newspaper,
as Packett names them as the wanted criminals sought, even mentioning
the killing she did in St. Louis, and their names go over the wire
service, so that his hometown of Cashville is now aware of his crime
spree. After spending some time on-the-run, they plan one more big
robbery and have hopes of getting enough money from that one to retire
from crime (at least he feels that way). The both get jobs in an Armour
meat-packing plant in New Mexico and rob the payroll office, but this
time the office manager, Miss Sifert (O'Neal), rings the burglar alarm
in the middle of the robbery and Laurie plugs her. In their getaway, it
also becomes necessary for her to shoot a company guard who is in their
way. She tells Bart, that when she gets scared she uses her gun to kill.
Bart comments: "Two people dead, just so we can live without working!"</P>
<P>The two make plans to split-up for a few months and then get together
again, but they can't go their separate ways, having fallen too
passionately in love with each other. In town, they are staying in a
California hotel near the ocean and have made arrangements by bribing
some officials to get across the border into Mexico. Bart hopes to use
the money to buy a ranch in Mexico and maybe raise a family there.
Celebrating their changing luck by going on some amusement rides and
then dancing in the fairgrounds, they notice some federal agents have
spotted the marked money from the robbery they were using and assume
they are waiting for them back in the hotel, where they kept the stolen
loot. They are now broke and on-the-run again, as they flee town by
carjacking a cab and then riding the rails out of town.</P>
<P>With no place else to run to, they return to his small-town and force
their way into Ruby's place. She has a few children and is not pleased
to see them. The neighbors notice she has her blinds down and they
inform Clyde about it, who brings Dave along with him to Ruby's place,
suspecting he is there and that they can talk him into peacefully
surrendering. The two desperadoes have no intention of surrendering, and
after locking Ruby in the garage, they try to escape by going up a
mountain road. When trapped overnight in a swamp, chased by dogs and a
police posse, Dave and Clyde find them in the old hiding spot they used
as youths. When Laurie tries to kill them, Bart shoots her, the only
killing he does, and is shot in return by the sheriff, who mistakingly
thinks he was shooting at them. The swamp was used because this
low-budget film couldn't afford the money to pay extras and the swamp
scene would require only a limited cast.</P>
<P>As film noir, this hard-boiled story is much superior to the more
popular and more critically acclaimed "Bonnie and Clyde," which covered
the same territory story-wise: amour fou- the running away together by
lovers. Both films were based on the real lives of the infamous criminal
couple. This fast-action film, with its typically notorious femme fatale
depicted, is subversive to the nth degree. It celebrates the couple's
disregard for the law and their insatiable appetite for their own
desires, which causes them to disregard middle-class values, as they act
with a sense of bold impropriety. This is in line with what The Nation's
former iconoclastic film critic, Manny Farber, called many films such as
this one, that were now accepted by the surrealists and the new brand of
intellectual youths, revolting against the middlebrow critics who called
this merely a B- "pulp" film. He complimented films of this kind by
endearingly calling them, "perceptive trash." Whatever weakness the
story had as it waivered between art and entertainment, and even if it
was acted by not the most accomplished of actors, yet there was a raw
innocence about it creating a special kind of  appeal to those who could
feel its lively pulse beating to their resentment of the establishment.
It should be remembered that this film came out at a time before there
was rock & roll, a civil rights demonstration, and a Vietnam War protest
movement, that even if the film appears dated in certain spots when
presently viewed, it still retains its revolutionary spirit of youth
being forced to find their own identity in the world, as they profoundly
and uninhibitedly search for love.</P>
