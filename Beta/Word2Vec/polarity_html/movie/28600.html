<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A Spaghetti Western that can't be ruined by poor dubbing, an
outlandishly gross tale, dialogue that is meaningless, acting that's the
pits, a body count for enemies that would satisfy the Pentagon during
the entire Vietnam War, an acrobat who annoyingly can't stop doing
flips, an obnoxious strolling banjo player with a rifle hidden in its
neck, a drunk knife-thrower, one-dimensional villains, and an assortment
of nonsensical gun duels. This film is so bad, so lacking in humor and
romance, or any possible relation to reality, yet it is still mindlessly
entertaining. Lee Van Cleef is offered a satchel full of money to go to
Italy and do his steely eyed gun thing. Here he plays the titled
character, an expressionless bounty hunter with a few James Bond tricks
up his sleeve, and a penchant for killing.</P>
<P>As Sabata, clad in all black, enters the dusty Texas town named
Daugherty he befriends the local beggar, the disheveled, straggly
bearded Carrincha (Sanchez). The beggar will hook him up with another
amigo to watch his back, an acrobat named Alley Cat (Jordan). While
Sabata is in the saloon...he prevents a gambler from playing with the
houses' loaded dice...but, meanwhile outside, a gang of bank robbers
kill off the cavalry guards and rob the Army safe of $100,000. It's soon
learned by him that the pillars of the community are behind the robbery:
the saloon keeper Ferguson (Gradoli), Judge O'Hara (Rizzo), and the
gang's leader, the greedy land baron, Stengel (Ressel). The group wants
the money to invest in more land, because they got the word that the
railroad is coming through.</P>
<P>Sabata ambushes the seven bank robbers and kills them all from long
range, and brings the safe back to the colonel in charge of the Army
regiment in town. He stays in town to receive his $5,000 reward and then
starts blackmailing the pillars of the community to pay him hush money
to stop him from blabbing about their part in the robbery. Also, in town
is an untrustworthy banjo player (Berger). He's with one of the saloon
girls, Jane (Veras), who dreams of getting together enough money for
them to get out of this dumpy town.</P>
<P>The film had a few odd quirks about it; for instance, Stengel is seen
reading the book "Inequality is the Basis of Society;" Sabata kills the
false padre by pulling on a string he attached to the hidden gun in his
money satchel he offers the padre; Sabata carries a derringer with a
triple-bullet chamber, and he possesses a rifle with a firing range of
3,000 feet; in another scene he must have killed a hundred or so of the
thugs Stengel has guarding his house. There are a series of gun duels
with the mercenaries Stengel hires, and there is his secret partner to
deal with, the banjo player, a gunslinger who's loyalty is questionable.</P>
<P>There's a lot of spaghetti tossed about in this conventional Hollywood
looking plot but, nevertheless, typical Italian action Western. It's not
for all tastes, even those who like Westerns might not care for the
amoral personification of the Lee Van Cleef character. But you can't
beat this film for continuous gunfights and mounting body counts. This
is the first of a trilogy about Sabata.</P>
