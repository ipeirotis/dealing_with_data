<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A risky commercial venture that sometimes works in a serious way but is
somewhat beaten down by the lack of vision it exhibits while in its
romantic mode, as opposed to how alluring it was as a moralistic
survival film. The film is carried solely by Tom Hanks' splendid
performance, with him reflecting without the need of dramatics or
dialogue the changes he is going through, as he acts through use of
facial expressions and body language. He even starts off as a bit
overweight, but by the time he leaves his island, he's skinny (He must
have gone on some crash diet to have lost the reported 50 pounds!).</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoilers to follow.</PRE>
<P>The adventure story is reminiscent of a modern-day Robinson Crusoe tale,
and is divided into three distinct parts, with Tom Hanks being the
film's mainstay. In the first part, he's shown as a compulsive
workaholic, a stickler for efficiency and being on time, who is employed
as a FedEx management system engineer from Memphis. He is in the new
free market Russia of the mid-nineties, there to help his company get
more efficient in its deliveries. On his return from Russia, he
exchanges Christmas gifts at the Memphis airport runway with his
grad-student girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) and tells her he'll be
right back from this latest assignment to Asia. He is about to pop the
marriage question to her, but must catch his plane, so he instead gives
her a wrapped box with a ring in it and tells her they'll open it
together when he returns on New Year's Eve. But his FedEx plane runs
into foul weather and strays off course and then explodes in mid-air
from undisclosed chemicals it has in storage, and he becomes the sole
survivor, using the plane's raft to reach a barren island.</P>
<P>The second part of the film is almost bare of dialogue and runs for
close to two hours, showing how he survives while living alone on this
South Pacific island for 4 years. The striking visuals and penetrating
silence, give this film a surprising depth to its storytelling.</P>
<P>The last part of the film, shows him returning from being perceived as
dead and having to adjust to Kelly marrying and raising a family.</P>
<P>The heart of the film is about Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) ironically going
from his job where he is obsessed by time to living on a barren island
where time doesn't matter and there is no rush to do anything. He slowly
learns how to survive, light a fire without matches, cut open the
coconuts, catch crabs, build a shelter, and as an additional irony, he
is surrounded by FedEx packages washed ashore, as he learns to make use
of the various objects he finds in them. In one of the packages, he
comes across a volleyball and smears a blood-stained face on it and
names it Wilson. He converses with it as if it were a human companion.
Hanks' is now faced with panic and he reacts by acting childlike,
thinking that is the only way he can survive without going nuts.</P>
<P>There were times that this island fare seemed mildly poetic, but at
other times it began to wear heavy as time dragged with only Tom Hanks
on the screen to keep the fire going. Yet the film had a certain appeal
to it...a boldness not often seen in commercial films, as it bravely did
without dialogue for great parts of the island story. This lent a
certain sense of unpredictability to it and made the simple story lend
itself to being more introspective and interestingly perceived.</P>
<P>The major fault of the film lies in the capricious ending, where it ran
out of story and didn't know how to make Hanks' return to Memphis and
civilization shed some light on what he's been through without
trivializing that experience. Hanks, while on a deserted crossroad after
delivering a FedEx package that survived the crash, doesn't seem certain
of what's in store for him in the future but puts on an artificial
pretty face as he wanly smiles (knowingly, he will always live alone
with that island experience).</P>
<P>But what didn't resonate was the ambiguity of the film's ending. I think
the film had nowhere to go after he was rescued by ship while on a raft,
as he chose to take a perilous chance to sail the ocean in order to get
back to civilization rather than remain as a caveman-like survivor on
that desolate island. That is the simple point the film is trying to
make and where the film should have ended, but when it tries to
reinforce its sappy love story with characters who had too little screen
time to have an effect on the story and it forces corny words on those
characters in order to resolve Hanks' love situation, the film thereby
loses something by its Hollywoodish formulaic message it tries
desperately to land safely on. Otherwise, a pleasing film from the
director of Forrest Gump, Robert Zemeckis. One of his better ones...with
the adventure part of the film having some appeal though not delving
deep enough into the survivor's psyche for it to have an even greater
appeal. But it was far superior to that recently popular Survivor TV
show, which had more to do about making a million bucks than surviving.</P>
