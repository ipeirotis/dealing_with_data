<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Decadence rules the day for Abel Ferrara's offbeat soft-porn look at how
the modern world has come up with a new criminal type-the international
corporate raider. The problem with the film, as an original and
diverting story as it is, is that it is also too confusing to follow and
suffers from a sense that it is too "hip" for its own good. But even as
the film failed to add up to being as good as it could have been, it was
still entertaining and visually engaging.</P>
<P>Willem Dafoe as X and a gimpy legged Christopher Walken as Fox, play two
corporate raiders who hatch this fantastic plot to steal a Japanese
geneticist, who is involved with mutating a virus that could cure the
common cold, Hiroshi (Yoshitaka Amano-a designer of video games). He is
married to a German woman (Mol) and has everything in the world that he
could possibly want. But Fox views him as a fish out of water, someone
who doesn't fit in with those corporate scientist-types, someone who is
always on the edge, which means that he has the guts to do the
unexpected, to break down clichés from the past.</P>
<P>The plan, which Fox calls elegant for its simplicity, is to get the
scientist over on their side through one of the two things he has the
hots for: sex. Though he is getting his share of nooky, the corporate
raiders sense that he doesn't show passion about it, he is missing
something in his life which they will provide him. That something is an
Italian prostitute named Sandi (Asia Argento-the daughter of the Italian
cult horror director). She will be given a million dollars for her part
by the two raiders and all she has to do is fall in love with him and
make him fall in love with her so that he leaves his wife and science
position to go with her and start life anew. Needless to say, Sandi has
the body parts to fit the part she is playing.</P>
<P>The film is meant for one to get lost in its kinky sexual encounters, in
its opium dream sequence, in its half-baked aphorisms constantly pouring
out of Fox's secretive mind, and for one to be enamored by a web of
corporate espionage ventures that takes the viewer into sleek offices
and down dark noir passages, across unknown cities, as it makes the most
casual conversation between the parties seem couched in double-meaning-
while in reality, everyone seems to be on video surveillance.</P>
<P>Fox and X, plan to sell Hiroshi to a rival corporation for $100 million
dollars, though Fox, as the leader, continually says he is not in it for
the money- but, "That knowledge is virtue. The unexamined life is not
worth living."</P>
<P>I began to enjoy the film more for its style, which is the only way to
view it. It was shot in such exacting detail, its colorful sets becoming
a feast for the eyes that were ready to experience visions not seen in
other sci-fi films, it also allowed for a certain pleasure to be induced
from overhearing the odd conversations that were inane but fun to listen
to. Fox's haiku is a good example of the meaningful nonsense the film
conveyed, as he recites to X the poem he just wrote:</P>
<PRE>                        "A dog walks into a bar
                      dressed in a suit and a tie
                and orders a Scotch and a toilet water."</PRE>
<P>Intrigue becomes part of the picture, as things work out too well for
the two raiders, as Hiroshi leaves his wife and goes with Sandi to
Marakesh, in a science lab specially built for him. But something
mysterious soon happens and the last 20 minutes of the film repeats what
happened so far, but adding new details and a different way of looking
at it. The murky ending will not be pleasing to most viewers, as they
try to make sense of what is happening.</P>
