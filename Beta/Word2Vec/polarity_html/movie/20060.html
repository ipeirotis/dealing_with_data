<P>Freddy Krueger is a horror icon on the same level as Dracula, Frankenstein's
monster, King Kong, among others. The character is Wes Craven's invention and
it still is an imaginatively created character. Freddy has a burnt face, glove
with four sharp razors, a red and green sweater, a fedora hat, and an attitude.
The original "Nightmare on Elm Street" is among the best and most original
horror films ever made - a scarefest that examines the psychological dreams and
the subconscious of unruly teenagers living on Elm Street who are being pursued
in their dreams by a child killer named Freddy. If he kills you in your dreams,
you'll wake up dead. The inevitable sequels were not quite on the same league
as the original but they were creative, visual tour de forces with excellent
special-effects and a jocose Freddy. Wes Craven was not involved in any of the
follow-ups but he came up with a new idea in 1994 - a film-within-the-film
treatise on the danger of the "Nightmare" movies and how they affect the cast
members. It is a noble idea but it doesn't quite deliver any new themes or
ideas. </P>
<P>"Wes Craven's New Nightmare" stars Heather Langenkamp as herself, an actress
whose life dramatically changed since she completed the "Nightmare" movies. She
has a nice house in L.A., a faithful husband (David Newsom) who works on
special-effects, and a seemingly disturbed young son named Dylan (Miko Hughes)
who watches scenes from the original "Nightmare" movie and even speaks like
Freddy (he also loves to read "Hansel and Gretel"). Not all is well as we
discover something ominous is happening in the Langenkamp residence. There are
the numerous phone calls from an obsessed fan (maybe Freddy); several
earthquake tremors; Dylan screaming at the top of his lungs; her husband killed
in a car accident (could be Freddy's fault); and so on. Heather meets with
several of her movie co-stars (John Saxon and Robert Englund as themselves) to
determine what is happening. My feeling is that she dotes on and is overly
protective of her son, Dylan, but that's just a thought. Perhaps Dylan
shouldn't be watching any of those movies. What do you think, Heather?</P>
<P>It turns out that Heather is being offered a new role in a new "Nightmare"
movie, hence the movie we are watching. Wes's new script had been devised to
get rid of the demon who has been unleashed into the world after killing off
the fictional character in Freddy's Dead. As Wes explains in one of the best
scenes in the movie, this demon is more powerful and more evil than Freddy and
Heather must try to stop him from getting her and her son. It is art imitating
life in the broadest sense, and this is possibly the best and most twisted idea
in the whole series by far. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, Wes screws it up because he doesn't allow the screenplay to play
for some clever thrills and psychological meanings. Instead, he opts for clever
inside jokes and unwarranted hysteria. Being a confessed Freddy fan myself, I
enjoyed seeing all the puns and jokes, and I liked seeing some of the actors as
themselves (look quickly for Tuesday Knight from "Nightmare 4"), the agents,
New Line president Robert Shaye, etc. The movie plays like a docudrama and
that's when it works best. It's the dramatic, personal stuff, that doesn't
work.</P>
<P>The biggest flaw is the crucial casting of the Dylan role: he's played by Miko
Hughes who overacts to the hilt and delivers fake screams. This kid is so
intolerable and so unlikable that it is difficult to build any kind of sympathy
for him or his plight. Heather Langenkamp does a relatively fine job of playing
herself (not Nancy) and she is at her best in the opening scenes where the
phone continually rings and her son continually screams - her dazed, agitated
behavior is superbly realized. For the rest of the movie, though, she seems to
be playing the character Nancy and not herself. Of course, she may be dreaming
the whole film that we are watching but that's a moot point. I like the scenes
where Heather is more relaxed such as when she meets with John Saxon at a park,
or when she converses with Wes at his house.         Some of the obligatory dream
sequences are excellent, including the magnificent (and overlong) inferno
ending where Freddy nearly swallows Dylan! I also liked the terrifying sequence
where Dylan walks across a highway where dozens of cars and trucks nearly hit
him. But most of the movie tries, and fails, to build suspense through
countless earthquakes, and numerous telephone rings as in Craven's "Scream."
Nothing in the film is particularly thrilling or compelling - it just becomes
repetitious and numbing after a while. </P>
<P>I saw this film three times because the critics thought so highly of it, and I
thought maybe I missed something. The first time I saw it, I hated it - it
seemed nothing like the previous films. The second time I saw it, I thought it
was just plain awful. The third time, I saw it on a TNT "Monstervision" special
(hosted by Joe Bob Briggs) and I appreciated some of the minute subtleties, and
the performances  were a lot better than I had anticipated. Director Wes Craven
just missed the mark by not investing the psychological, real-life horror of
horror movies taking over the lead actors' lives and their families. </P>
<P>"Wes Craven's New Nightmare" is not a terrible movie but it is unfocused and
mediocre - just being self-reverential is not enough. Still, if you're a Freddy
Krueger fan, you should check it out for the clever puns and the infrequent
brilliant nightmare scenes, but not for any other reason. Stick with the
original "Nightmare." </P>
