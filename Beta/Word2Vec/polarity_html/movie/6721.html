<P>     A cop with a troubled personal life.  A ruthless villain.  A friend
of the cop.  A _dead_ friend of the cop.  A quest for vengeance.  A new
partner.  A romantic interest.  A chase scene.  A chase scene _in San
Francisco_.  A woman in peril.  A confrontation.  An explosion.  The end.
Yawn.  Yawn.  Yawn.  The preceding has been the plot of approximately
twelve thousand and six action films; this one just happens to be called
METRO.  I have learned to expect little from films like METRO, and
consequently I am bored by them more often than I am genuinely
disappointed.  With Eddie Murphy on board, however, you hope for something
extra, some kind of spark.  When a film makes watching Eddie Murphy a
tedious experience, you know it is doing something terribly wrong.</P>
<P>     Murphy stars as Scott Roper, a hostage negotiator for the San
Francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job.  With his
personal life, he is considerably less successful, facing an unhappy
ex-girlfriend named Veronica (Carmen Ejogo), a gambling problem and a
mountain of debt.  Then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a
friend and colleague (Art Evans) is murdered while investigating suspected
jewel thief Michael Korda (Michael Wincott).  Finding Korda becomes very
personal to Scott, and he joins with new partner Kevin McCall (Michael
Rappaport) to foil Korda during an attempted heist.  But all is not well
even with Korda in jail, as Scott, Veronica and Kevin all continue to face
life-threatening danger.</P>
<P>     METRO (the title, in case you are wondering, means absolutely
nothing) is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may
notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads.  In the first place,
Korda's rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is
rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway
(and, incidentally, to screw it up).  A reference to payoffs in the police
department, followed by a conspicuous decision to keep Scott off the Korda
case and a couple of pointed glances, is dropped abruptly with no 
resolution after about forty-five minutes; even the relationship between
Scott and new partner Kevin is so perfunctory, with Kevin disappearing
entirely after taking a bullet for Scott, that you may yearn for bickering
buddies.  Worst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain
(the always menacing Michael Wincott) behind bars for far too long,
leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of Scott and
Veronica.</P>
<P>     You can't blame Murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for
the scenes with his bland leading lady, but he should have known better
than to take this role at all.  Scott Roper exists in an uncomfortable
middle ground between the kind of street-wise fast-talker Murphy has built
a career on and an actual three-dimensional character, and Murphy is never
able to reconcile the two.  The script seems to have been doctored for
him, with a gambling problem turned into a bit of character color and his
supposed inability to form relationships turned into a cause for gags
rather than actual conflict, yet there is still too little comedy for
Murphy to work with.  For much of the film, he walks around with an
intense frown, and it is over 90 minutes into METRO before you hear that
trademark laugh for the first time.  Murphy is stranded with too few solid
punch lines, and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of Ejogo and
fall to the ground limply.</P>
<P>     I suppose I should give director Thomas Carter credit for taking the
obligatory San Francisco car chase (how much do you want to bet on the
likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill?) and doing a few interesting
things with it.  As vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling
by a runaway cable car, it is possible at least for a moment to take some
pleasure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation.  Carter does an even
better job by taking that old suspense stand-by -- the medicine cabinet
mirror which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone -- and
using it to defuse tension not once, but _twice_.  The fact that Carter
was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches, and a
willingness to subvert them, makes his involvement in the rest of the
disaster that is METRO all the more puzzling.  An action film like this
plods so relentlessly and obviously from point A to point B to point C
that you might find yourself shouting out "point C!" while they're still
getting to point B, or getting up with the rest of the audience after the
big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going
to happen.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Murphy's losses:  3.</PRE>
