<PRE>                                    HIDEAWAY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jeff Goldblum, Christine Lahti, Jeremy Sisto, Alicia
Silverstone, Alfred Molina.
Screenplay:  Andrew Kevin Walker and Neal Jimenez
Director:  Brett Leonard.</P>
<P>     Thriller-cum-horror films tend to come in two basic flavors.
On one end you've got your high-school audience slasher film, one of
those infinitely sequeled flicks based on a charismatic killer named
Freddy or Chuckie or Pinhead; on the other end is your moody,
upscale thriller, something that genuinely tries to be creepy and
doesn't depend entirely on bursts of music or a cat leaping out at
someone.  There are about ten times as many of the former as the
latter, and as a result I limit the films in the genre that I choose
to see to those I have some moderate hope for.  HIDEAWAY could have
been one of the rare quality efforts, but instead of being
ambitious, it's mostly just pretentious and gimmicky, and pretty
dull besides.</P>
<P>     HIDEAWAY stars Jeff Goldblum as Hatch Harrison, a man returning
from a vacation with his wife Lindsey (Christine Lahti) and daughter
Regina (Alicia Silverstone) when the family car is hit by a truck
and sent over an embankment.  Lindsey and Regina survive, but Hatch
seems lost, until a doctor (Alfred Molina) uses an experimental
technique to bring him back from clinical death.  Naturally, there
are a few side effects:  headaches, trouble sleeping and an
unsettling tendency to see visions of murders.  Soon Hatch begins to
believe that he has become psychically connected to a young killer
who calls himself Vassago (Jeremy Sisto), and who appears to want to
make Regina his next victim.</P>
<P>     Based on the novel by Dean Koontz, HIDEAWAY has some fairly
promising psychological material at its core.  We learn that the
Harrisons recently lost another daughter in a hit-and-run accident,
an accident for which Hatch feels he is partly to blame, leading
Lindsey to conclude that Hatch's "visions" of Regina in danger are a
manifestation of is need to redeem himself by saving his other
daughter.  There are also some potentially intriguing sexual
dynamics involved in Hatch's psychic voyeurism of his daughter being
seduced by Vassago.  These issues could have been utilized to make
HIDEAWAY something more than standard issue supernatural horror
fare, but director Brett Leonard refuses to let character matter.
While not nearly as techno-happy as he was in his previous film THE
LAWNMOWER MAN, Leonard still makes HIDEAWAY too much about filtered
shots (used to simulate Hatch's visions) and some absurd computer-
generated visions of the afterlife.</P>
<P>     At least the computer tricks are moderately interesting to look
at.  HIDEAWAY is mostly a big fat bore, full of performances which
could politely be called somnabulistic.  Jeff Goldblum takes his
halting, shifty-eyed, big-hand-gesture delivery and transforms
himself into...Jeff Goldblum.  It often appears as though in between
takes he was watching his own performance in THE FLY and wondering,
"How did I do that?"  Christine Lahti is solid as his wife, limited
mostly to looks of fear and worry, but she is convincing at both;
Alicia Silverstone, on the other hand, is just another nymphet in a
mini-skirt.  It is Jeremy Sisto who really deserves our pity,
though.  His teen psycho could have been fascinating and even
sympathetic, but he is turned into a tiresome heavy-metal-listenin',
sunglasses-at-night-wearin', virgin-sacrificin',
black-candle-lightin', devil-worshippin' plot device.  Satanists
everywhere should protest that this guy is ruining their image.</P>
<P>     HIDEAWAY completely implodes with a preposterous climax which
reduces the eternal battle between good and evil to a cool
psychedelic light show, with a life-affirming vision from beyond
thrown in for good measure.  It is, however, merely the logical
culmination of an incompetent directing job which can't even seem to
do cliches right.  HIDEAWAY is a good idea for a thriller; if only
it had been scary.  Or different.  Or *something*.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 near-death experiences:  3.</PRE>
