<P>     Yes, it's true -- STIR OF ECHOES features a child who sees dead
people.  It includes in its metaphysics the notion that disgruntled
spirits cause chilly temperatures in the human world.  It is at least
partially a tale of a wrongful death made right.  Depending on where you
fall in the old glass half-full/half-empty argument, STIR OF ECHOES is the
beneficiary of either extraordinarily good timing or extraordinarily bad
timing.  Maybe comparisons with mega-success THE SIXTH SENSE will doom it
to obscurity.  Or maybe a spillover effect, with movie-goers still hungry
for supernatural subject matter, will present it with an audience it might
not otherwise have had.</P>
<P>     For my money, viewers can't go far wrong either way.  If they go,
they'll be moderately satisfied; if they don't go, they won't be missing
all that much.  It begins as a tale of a working class Chicago guy named
Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) who dabbles in a garage band and generally feels
his life hasn't amounted to all that much.  That perception changes
radically when his sister-in-law (Illeana Douglas) hypnotizes him at a
party, turning him into a receiver for weird psychic visions featuring
a missing neighborhood teenager (Jenny Morrison). Tom also discovers that
his 5-year-old son Jake (Zachary David Cope) is even more tuned into the
netherworld, and that his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) is understandably
freaked out by his odd behavior.</P>
<P>     It's awfully easy to dwell on the similarities between STIR OF ECHOES
and THE SIXTH SENSE, weighing in simply with whether the former is better
or worse than the latter.  It would be easier to ignore those similarities
if the whole film didn't feel overly familiar.  When a kindly black cop
(Eddie Bo Smith Jr.) informs Maggie of Jake's visionary gifts, he suddenly
turns into Scatman Crothers in THE SHINING; when Tom's obsessive behavior
leads him to tear up the house and alienate his family, he's Richard
Dreyfuss in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.  The Richard Matheson
novel on which STIR OF ECHOES is based is forty years old, so no one can
rightly accuse the film of thievery.  That doesn't change the way STIR OF
ECHOES is likely to be viewed today: a mish-mash of familiar elements.</P>
<P>     That's not to say that STIR OF ECHOES isn't also a reasonably
effective thriller in its own conventional way.  David Koepp, who helmed
the unsettling and little-seen TRIGGER EFFECT, has a knack for crafting a
scene that gets under your skin without resorting to too many shock cuts.
He also draws nice work from a solid cast, particularly Erbe adding a few
shadings to the thankless wife role.  Koepp's direction may get a little
showy -- jittery time-lapse shots of ghosts, funky business in the
"theater" of Tom's hypnotic trance -- but it does its job manufacturing
the creeps.  It ain't deep, but it's scary enough.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately for STIR OF ECHOES, it's less effective than it could
be because Koepp seems to think it _is_ deep.  The subtext of Joe Six-Pack
Tom seeing his new gift as a shot at finally doing something extraordinary
comes and goes, and it's hard to see anything voluntary in his character
arc.  Bacon's performance suffers from this erratic motivation -- he's
reasonably convincing both in his terror and in his determination, but the
two never come together.  By the time Koepp trots out an extended
flashback of a crime in progress, his melodrama has bogged down the
chills.  Ironically, that's yet another way STIR OF ECHOES is like THE
SIXTH SENSE: it's a moderately clever genre diversion that wants us to
believe it's something more.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 stir crazies:  6.</PRE>
