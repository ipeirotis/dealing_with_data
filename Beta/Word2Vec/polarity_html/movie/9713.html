<P>     MAD CITY is one of innumerable motion pictures that gets derailed 
on the long track from premise to realization.  The semi-serious film, 
which stars high-profile actors Dustin Hoffman and John Travolta, and is 
directed by Costa-Gavras (BETRAYED), becomes the latest in the recent 
flurry of movies to make a statement about the growing lack of ethics in 
broadcast journalism.  It's all ratings and entertainment value, not 
integrity!  Unlike some of the more worthy contenders, MAD CITY fails to 
bring anything new to the table.  Every aspect of this movie has been 
presented before in a better film with a more involving setup.  If 
you've seen NETWORK, TO DIE FOR, WELCOME TO SARAJEVO, and especially 
Billy Wilder's 1951 biting satire, THE BIG CARNIVAL (aka ACE IN THE 
HOLE), MAD CITY will seem like a tired retread.  </P>
<P>     The absence of originality and inspiration isn't MAD CITY's only 
problem -- it also suffers from a shocking lack of subtlety.  The film's 
goal of skewering the media is pursued with such single-mindedness that 
nearly every supporting character is reduced to a familiar type:  the 
empty-headed local news personality, the arrogant network anchor, the 
innocent camera person seduced by fame and fortune, and the old-
fashioned news director who looks on sadly as the story is manipulated.  
Even John Travolta's Sam Baily isn't all that interesting -- he's 
basically a dumb lug who lets circumstances get away from him.  Only Max 
Brackett (Hoffman), an ambitious TV reporter covering the story from the 
inside, is worth a second look.</P>
<P>     "The story" is a hostage situation at the local Museum of Natural 
History.  Sam, an out of work security guard, returns to the site of his 
dismissal to plead with his former boss (Blythe Danner) to get his job 
back.  When she refuses to hear his case, he pulls out a gun and starts 
shooting.  In the process, he accidentally hits his best friend, Cliff 
(Bill Nunn), the museum's only remaining security guard.  Sam, suddenly 
in over his head and unsure what to do, locks up the building and takes 
everyone inside hostage -- including a class of young children there on 
a school trip.  Unbeknownst to Sam, Max is on hand, hiding out in the 
mens' room.  It isn't long before Max is on the air with an exclusive, 
and, after Sam discovers him, his role changes from covering the 
situation to manipulating it by offering Sam advice how to solidify his 
position and do damage control.</P>
<P>     The centerpiece of MAD CITY is obviously the interaction between 
Sam and Max, as the former tries to figure a way out of the mess he has 
gotten himself into and the latter tries to exploit the situation.  Max 
has no compunction about crossing over the blurred line that divides 
reporting a story from becoming part of it, while Sam doesn't understand 
the dynamics of the situation -- until, that is, he looks out a window 
and sees the throng of reporters and law enforcement officials that has 
gathered around the museum.  Sadly, however, while the relationship 
between Sam and Max starts out interesting, it rapidly turns routine as 
Max gets an attack of conscience.  MAD CITY says everything it wants to 
say in its first forty-five minutes.  After that, it spins its wheels 
for over an hour, waiting for the inevitable conclusion.  </P>
<P>     Despite Costa-Gavras' best manipulative efforts, Sam never captures 
our sympathy.  The intent is for us to identify with him as a victim at 
the end of his tether (sort of like Michael Douglas in FALLING DOWN), 
but he comes across as someone who's so stupid that he deserves what he 
gets.  Worse still, he's a static personality with no dramatic arc.  
He's the same at the end as at the beginning, and it's difficult for an 
audience to connect with an individual who exhibits no growth.  Travolta 
does an adequate job in this role, but he doesn't have a character of 
substance to work with.  </P>
<P>     Hoffman, who previously played the less jaded but equally energetic 
Bernstein in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, is excellent as Max, MAD CITY's 
dubious moral compass.  But, although Hoffman gives Max flair, there's 
little that he can do to correct the overlong and derivative script.  
None of the supporting actors really stands out with the possible 
exception of Alan Alda, who does a credible imitation of a snake in the 
grass.  His character, Kevin Hollander, "the man America trusts for 
news" is so self-serving that he makes Max look like an ethical pillar.</P>
<P>     In his examination of the media feeding frenzy, Costa-Gavras throws 
in everything but the kitchen sink.  There are tabloid reporters who 
manufacture questionable witnesses and harass a man lying in a hospital.  
There are "straight" reporters who edit interviews to reflect the angle 
they're looking for.  There are fringe elements of the press who play up 
the racial card (the man Sam shot is black).  There are network 
executives who are only concerned about ratings.  There are police who 
won't move until public opinion is on their side.  MAD CITY's overall 
picture of the media is decidedly unflattering. </P>
<P>     The movie is also awash in subplots, none of which amount to much.  
In fact, they seem like filler to pad the movie out to its nearly two 
hour length.  For a film that covers so much material, MAD CITY seems 
surprisingly drawn out, but the reason is that it fails to do much of 
anything well.  The satire isn't sharp and the drama isn't effective.  
Watching MAD CITY, I felt much the same way that I did 5 years ago while 
sitting through Hoffman's HERO -- great idea, poor execution.  MAD CITY 
doesn't work because it's an exercise in themes and ideas that never 
gels into a compelling story.  </P>
