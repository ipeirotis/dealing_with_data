<P>Plot: Michael Myers returns to Haddonfield on Halloween night where he 
stalks Laurie Strode's cousin Kara and her family who have moved into 
the old Myers house. Kara's nerdish neighbour Tommy Doyle discovers 
abandoned the baby that is the last surviving inheritor of the Myers 
name that Michael is determined to kill. As he tries to protect the baby 
he discovers that Michael Myers is the incarnation of an ancient druidic 
personification of evil and is being sought by a group of modern druidic 
cultists in the town.</P>
<P>A strong case could be made that John Carpenter's cult 1978 hit 
`Halloween' was a film that shaped the face of the modern horror film. 
With `Halloween' Carpenter set out with no real intent other than to 
craft a pure rollercoaster ride of jolts and shocks. `Halloween's appeal 
rested as much in the ability to streamline the horror film into a pure 
shock machine, as it was to take it out of the shadows of Hammer Gothic 
and the melodramatic thriller contrivations of `Psycho' and its ilk and 
make it a wholly modern new form. The film's influence can be felt 
through an enormous number of other films from `Friday the 13th' and `A 
Nightmare on Elm Street' and their various sequels and imitators through 
to the obvious homages in the current `Scream' films.</P>
<P>After the success of `Halloween', Carpenter oversaw the obligatory 
`Halloween II' in 1981 but then with 1982's `Halloween III: Season of 
the Witch' tried to use the `Halloween' name to kick off an original, 
unlinked anthology series. That was an idea that promptly went nowhere. 
Carpenter then sold out interest in the franchise and 1988's `Halloween 
IV: The Return of Michael Myers' made a predictably sequelistic return 
to The Shape/Michael Myers saga. By the time of this, the fifth sequel 
to `Halloween', a thorough sense of pointlessness hangs over the series. 
What stood `Halloween' above the mostly worthless run of slasher film 
imitators - the `Friday the 13th' films being a perfect example - was 
the seat-edge directorial grip with which it was crafted. Sadly what 
made `Halloween' work is a lesson that almost no slasher film succeeded 
in learning, with almost all  substituting potpourris of gory despatches 
and a lineup of faceless teen victims over the creation of suspense and 
characters that one could give a damn about. And even more sadly this is 
a lesson that all of the `Halloween' sequels have even failed to learn 
from the source they owe their own name to.</P>
<P>There are occassional moments were director Joe Chappelle seems on the 
verge of rediscovering some of the style that Carpenter infused the 
original with - the there again/gone again pop-up tricks and the spooky 
peripheral shots with The Shape appearing on the edge of the camera 
frame or behind people's shoulders. But these occasional moments are 
ruined by pointlessly gory payoffs which show the film has no real focus 
above the conveyor belt line of splattery novelty deaths served up in 
the average `Friday the 13th' sequel. The exercise is disappointingly 
hollow and by comparison manages to make both `Halloween's II' and `IV'  
suddenly seem a whole lot better by comparison.</P>
<P>The film is further shot in by a plot which throws in an absurd spin 
that turns Michael Myers into some druidic avatar of evil incarnate. The 
explanation for this is murky and sounds just as silly when offered up 
on screen as it does in description here.  Even more ill explained are a 
series of subplots that reveal several of the cast members as belonging 
to some type of baby-snatching druidic cult that wants Michael Myers and 
the last surviving Myers baby. (Why, is never made clear). You could 
almost argue that the film might be trying to establish some type of 
grand  thematic link to unite itself up with the druidic witchcraft plot 
of the unconnected `Halloween III'. But in truth the film is shabbily, 
indifferently plotted and a disgracefully poor blackening of the eminent 
name of its original that it bears.</P>
