<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A bleak look at how the Boston underworld operates, a film which was
based on the best-seller by George V., Higgins. It is seen through the
weary eyes of a 51-year-old, small-time hood, Eddie "Fingers" Coyle
(Mitchum). He got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element
shut the draw on his hand as a punishment. His current dilemma is that
he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year
stretch in New Hampshire, something he feels will be a life sentence for
him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age. He is
also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare.
He could have cut a deal and gotten off, if he turned his boss over to
the D.A., but he figured he would never live if he did that.</P>
<P>He is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers
led by Scalise (Rocco). The masked bank robbers operate by always first
going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and
then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for
them or else his family gets it. On one of the heists, they kill a bank
officer who pushes the alarm.</P>
<P>Coyle's best friend is Dillon (Boyle), a hit man for the mob, working as
a bartender. He is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents, as an
aggressive young agent named Foley (Jordan), who likes to be called
uncle, gives Dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level
crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record,
as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening
with the gangs.</P>
<P>With the sentencing date closing in on him, the already convicted Coyle
is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time. He
contacts agent Foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then
decides to do something that goes against his grain. Thinking he made an
iron-clad deal with Foley to get his sentenced squashed in New
Hampshire, he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going
down, knowing full-well the young hustler (Keats) selling the guns is a
lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life
sentence.</P>
<P>But Foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer, that New Hampshire
wants more before they take away his jail sentence, they want him to be
a full-time informer.</P>
<P>Warning: spoiler follows in next paragraph.</P>
<P>The bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is
convinced Coyle did it and gives Dillon the contract to take care of his
friend. The contemptuous Dillon befriends Coyle and treats him to a
steak dinner and takes him to a Bruin hockey game while getting him
boozed up. Coyle takes a look at the young Bruin star Bobby Orr from his
upper deck seat and says, "To be young like that and have his future,
he's the greatest hockey player in the world." Dillon then takes the
drunken Coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style, having a kid
who works for him dump the body in some bad section of Boston.</P>
<P>This is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets,
of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in, and how they
are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing
will happen next. The city streets are ugly, the gangsters are shown to
be capable of any action to defend their own interests, whether it is
betrayal or murder. There is a fatalistic feel about their lives,
something Robert Mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat. Mitchum
gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs, as it overcomes
a thin plot. It makes you see the characters for what they are without
any false sympathy for them. Mitchum is a loser; and, that he lived so
long, is a tribute to his skills as a survivor. But in the end, he even
loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy,
as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle.</P>
