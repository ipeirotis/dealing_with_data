<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Mr. Cahn, in this AIP cheapie, provides some amusing hokum exploiting
the occult-horror B-film genre in a very Hollywood type of way. The
film's location is an unnamed beachfront community in Southern
California, where both a skeptical police Lt. Ed James (Randell) and a
square professor of psychic research Dr. Ted Erickson (Lance Fuller),
are faced with unsolvable murders and the one they suspect is doing the
killings is a mad occult-hypnotist Dr. Carlo Lombardi (Chester Morris).
They aim to get the evidence to convict him of a series of bizarre
murders by proving that he is a charlatan. Lombardi claims that the
killer is a supernatural she-creature who comes to life from the
beginning of time and comes out of the sea to commit murder. He gets
visions of the creature who communicates with him and thereby can
predict when the creature will appear. He has a beautiful assistant, a
former carnival worker, Andrea (Marla), who hates him but is so
possessed that she can't break free from the slave-hold he has on her.
In his act, he puts her under hypnosis and she becomes a 17th century
English woman.</P>
<P>The film opens with Lombardi staring furtively out to sea, conjuring up
the creature. A set of larger than human footprints with seaweed appear
on the sand; Lombardi follows them to a beach house. Inside the house, a
couple has just been brutally killed. Lombardi is seen coming out of the
house by Erickson and then walking casually along the shoreline.
Dorothy's dog King is barking near the beach house and leads her and her
boyfriend Erickson there. On the same beach, her parents, the wealthy
Chappels are hosting a party, where Mrs Chappel (Freda Inescort) is
being teased by her husband Timothy (Tom Conway), for believing in
Lombardi's predictions and ability to communicate with the dead.
Erickson is at the party as a guest of Dorothy.</P>
<P>Erickson is uncomfortable with her rich society connections and more
comfortable with his academic scientist friends, who share the same smug
beliefs as he does. He seems uncommitted to her outpouring of love.
Instead, he falls in love with the very warm-hearted Andrea.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Chappel, a businessman who will do anything to make a buck,
offers Lombardi a fifty-fifty partnership in the occultist's act, with
all expenses paid by him. Lombardi not only accepts, but moves into
Chappel's luxurious home.</P>
<P>Chappel also tells Erickson that he can make plenty of money from
Lombardi's fraud act by promoting his predictions and that he will give
Erickson the money earned from the venture to help him get off to a good
start when he marries his daughter. Erickson refuses to accept money
that he considers to be dirty. He will become a vocal critic of
Lombardi, trying to figure out his trick, and will work with the police
to see how he manages to get the sea-creature to commit these murders,
and try to find out if there is such a thing as this creature. It was
rather comical to hear, that one of Erickson's harshest criticisms of
Lombardi is, "He is putting hypnotism back twenty years."</P>
<P>When a local carnival barker (Paul Dubov) who once employed Andrea and
is still concerned for her safety, is found murdered in his apartment in
a supernatural way, after expressing concern to Lombardi about how deep
he puts her under hypnosis, the police arrest Lombardi, but Chappel
sends his lawyer to bail him out.</P>
<P>The act has so far earned them $250,000 a piece. The profits pour in:
from a best-selling book written by Lombardi about Andrea, who while in
hypnosis discovers that she is a reincarnation of a 17th century English
woman; from his syndicated columns in newspapers around the country;
and, from performing the popular act on stage, where he predicts when
the monster will strike again.</P>
<P>Paul Blaisdell is the monster in a chintzy rubber suit-which covers a
busty composite of scales, claws and tusks.</P>
<P>The viewer gets to see Lombardi put Andrea under at gatherings in the
Chappel house, where there is smoke coming from her or into her whenever
there is an exchange of souls. The Cahn way of filming these seances is
more funny than scary.</P>
<P>The final scene, where Lombardi realizes that the only thing that can
break Andrea's hold he has on her, comes from her strong love for
Erickson, as he decides to use his powers for the evil purpose of
killing his enemy Erickson. He possesses the dog's soul and King starts
to attack the professor but is ordered not to by Andrea. Lombardi then
puts Andrea under in Chappel's house gathering and the prehistoric
sea-creature comes out of the sea again, as the police try to burn him
and finally stop it with high-powered rifles.</P>
<P>This is strictly lightweight nonsense, which should be good for a few
laughs. It is perfect viewing as a Saturday matinee. I can't see anyone
taking this one seriously. The film ends in a mock serious tone, with
Erickson gazing out at the sea and telling Andrea (her spell was finally
broken) in a humble low voice, perhaps it was not meant for us to know
the dark secrets from the past.</P>
