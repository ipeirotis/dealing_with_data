<PRE>PAY IT FORWARD (2000)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: D</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Mimi Leder</PRE>
<PRE>Screenplay: Leslie Dixon</PRE>
<P>Starring: Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt, Haley Joel Osmet, Angie Dickinson, James 
Caviezel, Jay Mohr, Jon Bon Jovi, David Ramsey, Gary Werntz</P>
<P>When critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like PATCH ADAMS or more 
recently PAY IT FORWARD as I am about to do, their opinions are often greeted 
with a backlash of angry e-mails, sometimes even mock death threats from 
those who (I suppose) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their 
entertainment. Even politicians (!) tend to dismiss film critics as heartless 
cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising "filth" 
like PULP FICTION. These [fill in the derogatory term that you are 
comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic's job is to review the 
movie, not the message, however sweet and endearing that message may be. 
Thusly PATCH ADAMS isn't a bad film because it's about a doctor who cares for 
his patients; it's a bad film because it's a calculated piece of brazen 
audience exploitation. Similarly while PAY IT FORWARD may have its heart in 
the right place (though I even doubt that, stay tuned, an explanation is 
forthcoming), it's still an unpleasantly maudlin mess.</P>
<P>The picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher (a 
somewhat similarly guarded Kevin Spacey), with a burn scared face and equally 
singed attitude, who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of 
doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world. 
12 year old Trevor (Haley Joel Osmet), a Disneyfied do gooder who takes care 
of his alcoholic mother (Helen Hunt), comes up with the notion to PAY IT 
FORWARD; this entails a person doing one good deed (call it an uber favor) 
for three others, then telling them to do the same for three others and 
before long we're all living in a Frank Capra movie. Meanwhile in a parallel 
story, a weasely reporter (Jay Mohr) tracks the "movement" which has 
apparently begun to grow.</P>
<P>PAY IT FORWARD has odd ideas about tone; at certain points it hurls a 
smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate 
antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core. It's as if director Mimi 
Leder didn't have the confidence to make PAY IT FORWARD the way she intended, 
and compromised out of fear that her film wasn't "gutsy" enough to earn the 
acclaim it has clearly been made for. So the picture adds grit (a child 
molester propositions Trevor, a homeless man returns to heroin after being 
"saved", a character is knifed while doing a good deed, etc) though it seems 
shallow, incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn't 
quite sure if it's ready to buy into its own utopian blather.</P>
<P>PAY IT FORWARD offers "crowd pleasing" elements for general audiences; Jay 
Mohr's umpteenth variation on the WASPy sleazeball, Angie Dickinson's earthy 
alcoholic bag woman, and the jive-talking "black hoodlum with a heart of 
gold" (coming on the heals of the black, god-like inmate embodied by Gabriel 
Casseus in BEDAZZLED, this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty 
white liberal cliché. Hurray for Hollywood) who actually calls the Mohr 
character a "nigga" and says things like "can you feel me?" Leave it to PAY 
IT FORWARD to happily include a little minstrel act for our further 
enjoyment. (Maybe Spike's flick wasn't so misguided after all). These scenes 
feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather 
than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you'll find yourself trapped in 
should you not heed my warnings.</P>
<P>While the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope 
this is a film that could make the world a better place, to me the final 
product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting 
cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience. It's a picture that looks to be 
tailor made for Academy consideration, with the main players (all previous 
Oscar winners or nominees) given big emotional scenes that are practically 
variations on their most lauded turns. One scene in which a slightly 
de-glamed Helen Hunt (de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion 
victim [her look is somewhere between Goth queen and trailer park mama], 
Hunt's hair is also natty and badly bleached) verbally castigates Spacey, 
feels right out of her AS GOOD AS IT 
GETS Oscar clip. Spacey, of course, responds in his cultured monotone, that 
could be straight from his low key AMERICAN BEAUTY performance. Maybe the 
actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously 
irritating; though how can he not, even when he's emoting Spacey seems 
somehow shielded by a wry indifference.</P>
<P>The usually talented Helen Hunt is the worst offender. In one atrocious 
TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL moment Hunt slaps Osmet, immediately covering her mouth 
with the guilty hand in that very same stroke, and with said hand still on 
said mouth, she actually begins convulsing (dry heaving really), then (and 
I'm not making this up) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart 
in a frenzied search for alcohol. The scene is so hokey it could very nearly 
be construed as a parody of hackneyed TV movie blow-ups; it's all very 
theatrical, especially Hunt's performance, which feels like a pathetic plea 
to the Academy for another Oscar. PAY IT FORWARD has the dubious distinction 
of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn't 
get Academy Awards. The picture unknowingly affirms that Oscars transform 
nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists.</P>
<P>Even Haley Joel Osemt, the wunderkind who was nominated for an Academy award 
for his unforced performance in SIXTH SENSE, seems more divisive about his 
expressions and inflections. His acting has become broader, less intimate; 
it's as if we can make out the little munchkin's thoughts: "boy this outta 
floor em". Naturally Osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies 
children, a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother, lectures her on the 
ills of drinking, and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual 
teacher. Never mind that the two couldn't be more dissimilar; his mother is 
trailer trash dopey, and the teacher is one of those Dennis Miller-ey 
intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary. 
Nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair 
together in a scene that recalls PARENT TRAP-ish cornball antics. But oh how 
we love bright, articulate, self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by 
their bootstraps and guide them through life. They're so adorable.
Of course the blame can't all be hoisted onto the actors (though with the 
exception of the little kid, they probably should have known better), instead 
the brunt of it should be passed on to Mimi Leder, who directed one of the 
most thrilling episodes of ER, then went on to make two awful genre films in 
a row. The first being THE PEACEMAKER, a witless post-Cold War George Clooney 
vehicle, and DEEP IMPACT, one of the two films of 1998 to squander the 
premise of Earth's possible demise by a crazed meteorite.</P>
<P>The first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clichés, and a complete 
absence of any kind of emotional involvement, not aided by an ending which 
actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with 
digital read out (apparently present for an invisible audience). DEEP IMPACT 
has more in common with PAY IT FORWARD; it's a movie that treats Earth's 
impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms, completely ignoring the 
havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet 
would be a goner within days. The film was full of inspirational speeches 
where people really said nothing, though the sappy score swelled up to make 
it appear as if they were being profoundly touching. In PAY IT FORWARD Leder 
continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming 
almost like a rebuttal: "See my movie isn't as naïve as you 
might think" she seems to be saying. No, it's just horribly confused.</P>
