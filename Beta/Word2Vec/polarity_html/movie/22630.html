<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Erich von Stroheim meant this silent film completed in 1924 to run for
nine-and-one-half hours, but MGM forced him to cut it down, which he did
to four hours, but still not satisfied with that, the studio hired a
hack editor to cut the film on his own, which he did by cutting it down
to two hours. The completed film as originally done is not recoverable,
as the studio burned its copy, and if one is to believe von Stroheim,
they burned it to get money for the silver nitrate in the film. But
through the efforts of Rick Schmidlin, the producer of this
reconstructed video, who was able to recover two hours worth of the film
by using rephotographed stills, which were photographed by Warren Lynch,
and by dutifully following the director's instruction whether to zoom in
for a shot or fade out, preserved as much of the original film as he
could have. This successful project of reconstructing the epic
masterpiece into the one von Stroheim with his director friend Rex
Ingram had diligently cut from the original one no one ever saw, into
this acceptable four- hour production, makes the characterization of the
film much more plausible.</P>
<P>The film is based on Frank Norris' intensely naturalistic 1899 novel
"McTeague;" this version of it was recently shown on TCM and since it is
on the video format, it should probably be released soon in that video
form, and is worth looking for if you didn't catch it on TV.</P>
<P>Von Stroheim was determined to accurately recreate and recapture every
detail of every page of the source material, which is the reason the
film grew to unacceptable proportions for MGM's studio executive, Irving
Thalberg. The head of the studio, Louis B. Mayer, hated the idea of the
film and was not pleased that it was made, so there would be no help
forthcoming from him to save the project. Stroheim also insisted on
authentic location shots around the San Francisco and Oakland areas, and
of filming the final sequence at Death Valley under the harshest
conditions, causing camera equipment to be damaged and the loss of 26
pounds by Jean Hersholt, who played the role of Marcus Schouler. All
this did not endear the director to the cast or the film crew, as well
as to the studio bosses, but the brilliant result he got from his method
of filming makes all those expenses incurred and inconveniences seem
irrelevant. It should be duly noted that the film, in its butchered
form, was a box office flop when it finally opened, though the AFI film
critics still listed it as one of its 100 best films.</P>
<P>"Greed" is about the oppressive forces that decay and corrupt three
people - a beastly, uneducated man in turn- of- the- 20th century San
Francisco, John McTeague (Gibson Gowland) and his miserly, vulgar wife,
Trina (ZaSu Pitts) and their friend Marcus Schouler, who works in a dog
hospital - all who are caught up by their debased passion and greed for
gold. There is a subplot of another couple suffering from the same kind
of material greed; a junk collector, Zerkow (Gravina) and his mentally
unbalanced Mexican-American wife, who is a cleaning lady, junk
collector, and lottery salesperson, Maria Miranda Macapa (Dale Fuller).</P>
<P>In the film's prologue, it clearly states how the director intends to
follow closely from the book, as the book's opening is written onscreen:</P>
<P>I never truckled; I never took off the hat to Fashion and held it out
for pennies. By God, I told them the truth. They liked it or they didn't
like it.
What had that to do with me? I told them the truth; I knew it for the
truth
 then, and I know it for the truth now.</P>
<PRE>        FRANK NORRIS.</PRE>
<P>The film begins in the Big Dipper Gold Mine, in Placer County,
California, 1908, where McTeague's cruel, womanizing, and drunken father
(Curtis) works. When he dies, his mother (Piggott) opting for her son to
have a better life, talks a charlatan traveling dentist, Dr. "Painless"
Potter (von Ritzau) to take her son on as an apprentice. When his mother
passes away, she leaves him $250 and he decides to start a dental
practice on his own, in the working class area of Polk Street in San
Francisco.</P>
<P>He seems satisfied with his lot in life, not expecting much and not
getting much in return. He has one close friend, Marcus, who is going
out with his cousin Trina. When Trina falls at a picnic, chipping her
tooth, Marcus takes her to his friend Mac. This is the first-time the
inexperienced Mac feels anything for a woman and he instantly falls in
love with her, kissing her when she is under ether, and blaming his
unethical breach of conduct on inheriting his father's bad genes. When
Marcus senses something is wrong with his relationship with Mac, as they
are seated at a boardwalk pub, he is surprised when Mac tells him that
he fell in love with his cousin. After thinking hard about it, Marcus
decides to do Mac a favor and makes a big-deal of his self-sacrifice of
giving her up, by graciously letting him court Trina, saying now we will
be friends forever.</P>
<P>The courtship involves Mac meeting Trina's German mother (Ashton) and
father (Conklin) and their twin boys (Oscar & Otto Gottell), all of whom
like to go on picnics adorned with American flags. He becomes very
involved with Trina, but she puts off his advances to her and his
marriage proposals, and when asked by her mother how she feels about
him, tells her she doesn't know how she feels about him.</P>
<P>Trina and Mac become engaged. The event is celebrated with a theater
party attended by her mother also, as we see them coming out of the
theater with the crowd and they are excited about the show, as they each
talk about what they liked best: Trina: "I liked the lady best...who
sang those sad songs." Mommer: "Der yodlers!" Mac: "The fellow who
played 'Nearer My God to Thee'...on the beer bottles."</P>
<P>When they arrive home, the cleaning lady, Maria, who sold Trina her
lottery ticket, informs her that she won $5,000. Marcus takes the news
badly, saying to himself, I got soldiered out of the money that should
have been mine, if I wasn't suckered into giving her up, that money
would have been mine.</P>
<P>Trina and Mac get married a month later in the photographer's rooms that
Mac
rented for their future home. This is one sad and miserable marriage
ceremony, with a funeral procession visibly going by in the street
below. These unromantic signs being a harbinger of things to come. When
they open their wedding presents, the hateful Marcus, who refused to be
best man and had his fists clenched during the entire ceremony, gives a
gift of a pocket watch to the bride only. Mac then shows his gift to
her, as he removes the towel covering a gilded cage with two love-birds.
Trying to conceal her disappointment, she forces out a sweet smile
toward Mac. The family is moving for good to Los Angeles in a few hours,
as Trina feels despondent that she will not see them ever again.</P>
<P>They all sit down and eat like pigs for the next two hours and then
Trina tearfully clutches onto to her mommer, not wanting her to leave,
as the mother tells the doctor to take good care of her girl and she
tells her daughter to not be afraid, go to your husband. The two are
alone at last, with Trina, frightened to be alone with him, as they
awkwardly embrace and spend their first night together, and the first
part of the film concludes.</P>
<P>Trina's life soon becomes dominated by an obsession for money and she
hoards every cent she gets in a trunk and refuses to spend her money on
anything, and seems to enjoy only looking at her money and polishing it.
The only thing she buys for Mac is a huge golden tooth for him to hang
on the street to attract passers-by. She places the lottery winnings
into her Uncle Oelbermann's (Max Tryon) store, and draws interest from
that account. Slowly, as the three-year marriage becomes a failure, we
see how Trina becomes miserly and Mac is losing his love for her, as she
diminishes him as a person, curtailing his saloon drinking, and his
anger begins to grow. She refuses to part with any of her money, even to
purchase an affordable house, which would give them some needed
privacy... This turns out to be one cold marriage.</P>
<P>Too add to the couple's woes, there is the hatred Marcus displays toward
Mac, cursing him for stealing his girl and getting her money. He gets
into a fight with Mac in their favorite saloon, breaking his pipe and
flinging a knife at his head.</P>
<P>When returning home, Trina tells him about a letter she received from
her mommer asking for $50, which she says she can't afford to give, as
Mac replies in amazement, telling her that she should help her mother
out, telling her you are turning out to be real stingy. She tells him,
if mommer really needs the money, she will write again.</P>
<P>The relationship between Mac and Trina is barely tolerable at this
point, though there is still some bursts of affection now and then. When
Marcus comes to visit them at their home, this is after another
wrestling fight they had at the picnic, they are both relieved that he
tells them he is going good-bye for good, leaving the area to do some
cattle ranching downstate. Trina gasps, "Goodbye! That's the best thing
I ever heard Marcus say."</P>
<P>Bad news comes when he receives a letter from the Board of Dental
Examiners of California, informing him because he never went to a
recognized Dental College to get a diploma and does not have a license,
that he is therefore prohibited from continuing to practice Dentistry.
They both realize that Marcus squealed to the Board and is responsible
for putting Mac out of business.</P>
<P>Mac now can't earn an income and rapidly goes downhill and Trina refuses
to help him out, as Mac's anger grows, which makes her react
passionately to him for that moment, as submission suits her fancy. But
she will not give him money or any kind of moral support. He will come
home drunk from Frenna's saloon, and all she could think of is where did
he get the money to buy the drinks. A sign of things to come, is when
Maria is murdered by Zerkow, who then goes to the bay and commits
suicide. He killed her because she mentioned she had solid gold plates,
which she denied telling him she had, but which he believed that she had
and wouldn't tell him where it was. Trina uses her death to rent her
junk shack because the rent there is cheaper, to the dismay of Mac, as
the couple sink to new lows.</P>
<P>Mac's dislike for her grows as every day she becomes more stingy. He
becomes disheveled and becomes a loafer, and increasingly acts more
hostile toward her. There is no love left in him for her anymore. He
will abandon her, stealing the few hundred dollars she saved in her
trunk. When he wastes that money on whiskey, he goes looking for Trina
again, and finds that she has taken a job at a Kindergarten school as a
scrubwoman, as he finds their wedding picture ripped in half in the
garbage can in front of the school, where she is also living. When he
tells her that he is starving, that he needs some money to buy food, she
tells him she will give him nothing, that she can't forgive him for
stealing her money. Mac angrily enters the Christmas-decorated school
and demands that she give him the five thousand dollars from the
lottery. He repeatedly strikes her as she fights back, still refusing to
give the money, preferring to die instead, which is what happens as he
brutally murders her and flees back to his origins, back to the Big
Dipper Gold Mine, where his mother wanted him to escape from, to get a
better life.</P>
<P>Sensing that the police will be looking for him there he makes his way
to Death Valley, where he hooks up with a prospector (Fulton) and they
find quartz in the desert, making them millionaires. But that joy is
short-lived, as a posse is on his trail, and Marcus, seeing his picture
on a reward poster, vengefully goes after him, ignoring the advice of
the posse that it is impossible to cross the desert and come out alive.
The posse decide not go into Death Valley, but will wait for him by Gold
Mountain to reappear if he makes it out of there. But Marcus will trail
him some 100-miles inside Death Valley, and in some of the most
memorable movie shots ever, as von Stroheim insisted on shooting in the
summer, in the the middle of the day when the sun was the strongest, as
the two arch enemies are marked for death, having run out of water, and
will meet when Marcus gets the drop on him, but the stronger Mac, even
though he is hand-cuffed, will take the gun away from him and beat him
savagely to death with it. In one last gesture of humanity, Mac frees
his caged canary, but the bird doesn't have enough strength to fly away
and falls dead on his sack of gold coins he robbed from Trina. The two
die chained-together, as Mac's last look is at the gold coins sparkling
in the sun, which has been tinted bright gold for the movie.</P>
<P>Hollywood made a huge mistake in not following the way of the artist in
making a film, such as a von Stroheim wanted to make them, instead
opting for the box-office to determine a filmmaking project. They have
gotten what they have sowed, over-the-years, as a Hollywood film is
generally termed as an anti-art one.</P>
<P>This version of Greed is a don't miss one- a Hollywood art film that was
half-destroyed by them, yet still managed to somehow survive. Never has
the greed for lucre been depicted in such a real way, in such a vicious
and unrelenting manner, as it hones in on the destruction of lives that
are destroyed for no other reason than their mental breakdown is due to
their greed. The great acting by Pitts and Gowland make them seem at all
times believable and complex in their characterizations, each searching
desperately for what burns inside them.</P>
