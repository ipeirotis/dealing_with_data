<P>     Even today, 20 years after I first saw the original FANTASIA and 60
years after its premiere, I'm still not sure whether the entire concept is
audaciously praiseworthy or pretentiously misguided. Walt Disney's grand
plan to bring classical music to the masses-accompanied by animated visual
interpretation-ranks as one of the strangest cultural literacy experiments
in mass media history. On the one hand, it could be seen as a sincere
effort to bring kids to the castor oil of the classics, with a little eye
candy as sweetener. More cynically, it could be seen as an attempt to
persuade parents to take kids to a cartoon because it's really "good for
them"-sort of like extolling pizza as nutritionally sound because it
includes all four food groups. </P>
<P>     Yet another possibility is that it's an intriguing case study in
individual interpretation of an artistic work -- with all the peaks and
valleys that concept entails. FANTASIA/2000 introduces seven new visual
renderings of great compositions, wrapped around the return of Mickey
Mouse in Dukas' "The Sorcerer's Apprentice." Beethoven's "Symphony No. 5" 
becomes a tale of good and evil involving abstract shapes. Respighi's
"Pines of Rome" accompanies the adventures of a pod of humpback whales. 
Scenes of Depression-era New York life, sketched in the style of
caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, are set to Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." 
Hans Christian Andersen's "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" becomes the libretto
for Shostakovich's "Piano Concerto No. 2." Flamingos with yo-yos cavort to
Saint-Saens' "Carnival of the Animals." Donald Duck helps Noah with some
animal roundup to the march of Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance." And
Stravinsky's "Firebird Suite" turns into a mythological tale of birth,
destruction and rebirth.</P>
<P>     It's quite an eclectic program Roy Disney and supervising animator
Hendel Butoy have put together, and the results are predictably hit and
miss. There's the sense that FANTASIA/2000's creative team felt obliged to
maintain a balance between the experimental and the whimsical, when the
experimental pieces are the ones that leave the strongest impression. Most
dazzling of all is Butoy's computer-animated "Pines of Rome," in which the
image of whales soaring into the sky almost returns the literal meaning to
the word "breathtaking;" that moment alone made me wish I'd had the chance
to experience the film in its IMAX incarnation from earlier this year. 
It's a wondrous piece of work that creates its own world, a feat the
"Firebird Suite" segment comes close to matching (though there's more than
a little PRINCESS MONONOKE to the imagery). There is also an undeniable
energy to the "Rhapsody in Blue" segment, directed by Eric Goldberg
(ALADDIN) with a clockwork story sense and an obvious affection for the
artists who inspired both the look and the sound. When FANTASIA/2000
really lets its creative talent loose to explore the unfamiliar, the
results are impressive.</P>
<P>     Familiarity, however, doesn't help several of the segments. After his
appealing "Rhapsody in Blue," Goldberg gets anthropomorphized-critter
mundane with the cavorting flamingos of "Carnival of the Animals;" the
Noah story of "Pomp and Circumstance" also suffers from a case of the 
cutes. With "Pomp," there's the greater problem of the music's undeniable
connection to a specific context: graduation ceremonies. In fact, there's
something just a bit off about all of the segments connected to instantly
recognizable music-the grandiose abstractions of Beethoven's Fifth, the
Duck Tales-goes-Genesis "Pomp," even the generally satisfying "Rhapsody in
Blue." It may have been part of the FANTASIA plan to say, "Look, here's
another way to look at a piece of music you may have pigeonholed
previously," but it doesn't always work. A magical Mickey defined "The
Sorcerer's Apprentice" in the first FANTASIA; an antediluvian Donald just
makes you wonder why all these animals are graduating from the ark.</P>
<P>     A new twist to FANTASIA/2000 finds actors and musicians in brief
"host segments" introducing each work. Admittedly, a couple of them are
good for laughs (Steve Martin and Penn & Teller, to be specific). The rest
are an overly reverential bore. It's a curious decision, because if
there's one thing the rest of FANTASIA/200 is not, it's reverential. Even
when it flounders, it usually flounders because an experiment fails, not
because someone was unwilling to experiment. And that's the faint
damnation with which I ultimately praise the film: It doesn't always work,
but even when it doesn't work, it's in ways that make it obvious someone
was still trying. This FANTASIA inclines me to the perspective that it
should be seen as a showcase for pure inspiration, a way to see how fine
art can in turn inspire more fine art. This version is an uneven
realization of that vision. I'll still be looking forward to
FANTASIA/2060.</P>
