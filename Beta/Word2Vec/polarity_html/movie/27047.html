<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Patrice Leconte ("Monsieur Hire" (1989)/ "The Hairdresser's Husband"
(1990)/"Ridicule" (1996)) has created an original and strangely
beautiful B&W film, one that has its roots buried somewhere in French
New Wave cinema and in Fellini's road film La Strada. It is artfully
directed by Leconte, with his choppy camera work matching the
Mediterranean's bubbly sea movements and the trembling nature of the
feature players, plus his smoothly dark photography makes it seem as if
he's filming a 1940s noir work, and his eclectic musical background
soundtracks (ranging from Benny Goodman to Marianne Faithfull and from
Italian to Turkish music) adds an excitement to a story that changes
moods from comical to tragical at the drop of a knife. It should be
noted, in the director's biggest joke he has with the audience, how the
background music plays a large part in the enjoyment of the film. This
is shown when the knife-thrower hits his human target, as Brenda Lee
croons her song "I'm Sorry" and the Italian woman target is carried off
on a stretcher to the hospital.</P>
<P>The gist of the story revolves around an eccentric romance between two
desperate souls, one childish and trusting, the other jaded and
mystical. When the film is playful and lighthearted, it is sublime and
masterfully done. Unfortunately, when the last reel comes, the film
shifts gears and starts to take its philosophical musings about chance
and luck seriously, and the film becomes contrived and loses much of its
punch.</P>
<P>The power in the film's punch comes mostly from the imaginative
performances of international pop star Vanessa Paradis, the girlfriend
of Johnny Depp, and from one of France's most popular and best actors,
Daniel Auteuil. She was nominated for a Cesar as Best Actress and he won
a Cesar as Best Actor. These two have an electricity together that is,
indeed, magical, with both featuring very expressive facial gestures and
large eyes that open wider when welcoming the viewer into their story in
a most hospitable way.</P>
<P>Girl on the Bridge ran as a mainstream, commercial film in France, while
in America it has only played in art-houses. Perhaps any film with
subtitles (especially subtitles that are hard to read) and one that is
shot in black-and-white, can only be relegated to a select audience. Or,
maybe, a knife-thrower act in a circus venue is art in America, while in
Paris it might be viewed as the old -- seen that, done that thing.</P>
<P>The film opens to the beat of exotic Algerian music in the background
and a gap-toothed cutie of almost 22-years-old, named Adele (Vanessa),
being interviewed by an official sounding woman, who could be a social
worker, court official, or shrink, as the questioner is never seen or
identified, and no reason is given for why Adele is sitting in a bare
room by a table and answering personal questions. Adele tells her
hard-luck story in a matter-of-fact way, from the start of her
nymphomania and life of wandering from one man to another, to her
current feelings of depression. She is so persuasive, that we know
everything about her that we have to from this brief opening look at
her, so much so that when she shifts her eyes, we even know what she is
thinking.</P>
<P>The next time we see her, she's shivering and contemplating suicide by
jumping off a bridge overlooking the Seine River. Suddenly Gabor
(Auteuil), a middle-aged, has-been, philosophical knife-thrower, reveals
himself and tries to talk her out of jumping, even offering her a job as
his assistant, which in this case means being a human target for his
act. Gabor is on a recruitment mission, figuring that he is offering
this dangerous job to someone who is prepared to die anyway and
therefore should not be frightened off by the risks involved.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, she jumps into the water, and he jumps in to save her. Now
that's the start of a lifetime friendship, if you ask me. The girl not
only seems grateful that he cared enough about her to come to her
rescue, but he makes it possible for her to win his expensive diving
watch by playing a gambling game with her (never mind that we soon see
that he has many other watches in storage, it is the thought that
counts). They are now ready to begin their partnership and they start by
traveling to the south of France, where he books them into a circus at
Monaco. In order to get the job there, he volunteers to do a risky blind
knife-throw. She is so naive, that she has no idea of what she is
getting into. The knife-throwing is played as a metaphor for sex, as she
erotically gasps as the knife is thrown at her while wrapped around a
sheet. There was something bizarre about the act that was movie
magic...fake magic, I grant you, but magical enough to keep me glued to
my seat in anticipation of what will happen to her, as Leconte also had
the circus sideshow entourage gasping with concern. I think he might
even have expected the theater viewer to be masturbating over this.</P>
<P>The catch to their relationship, is that it is a chaste one, one that
allows him to have a telepathic relationship with her, as they read each
other's thoughts; but, it is one that does not prevent her from having
sex with any man who catches her fancy and to add to her sexual prowess,
she is keen on doing it in odd places and positions. My favorite tryst,
was her and the contorsionnist making it on top of the piano (the sex
act itself is only imagined and is tastefully not seen -- but can you
imagine how they did it?). The director also makes a concerted effort to
show that Gabor is normal sexually in the biblical sense, by showing a
brief encounter he has with a former girlfriend (Lascault) in the
circus.</P>
<P>Gabor discovers he can change his bad luck with her as his partner,
firmly believing that she's his lucky charm he has been missing, and he
sends her off to the gambling casinos in France and then the Italian
Rivera to play roulette and baccarat and she amasses a small fortune.
They are sitting on top of the world and he also begins to show his true
feelings which indicate he's falling in love with her, but staying in
character, he can't spit it out and tell her. Besides, sex would ruin
the mystical relation they have in the act and the luck they have in her
gambling.</P>
<P>Their downfall, which parallels the film's, is when they are on an
Adriatic cruise ship as performers and she meets a newly-wed Greek named
Takis and decides he is her Mr. Right, and she literally jumps ship with
him and flees the cruise ship on a small boat.  She falls for his fake
kindness and believes him when he says "My wife is Italian. We don't
communicate with each other." The film then moves off the map of
credible filmmaking and becomes silly and contrived, probably imitative
of those cartoonish-like action films, where there is a daring
helicopter rescue of the couple adrift at sea. For a film that was so
sublime and had such an enchanting mystical romance going for it, it
foolishly throws that all away to make its cheap points about chance and
to show how if two souls that fit together like two halves of a money
bill, will only have value if it does not get torn apart, which is too
heavy-handed a message for this bubbly film to handle.</P>
<P>The film should have been a more far-reaching one and it could have been
much funnier if it didn't go on the wrong cruise toward the end. But
what we have is still a visually spellbinding film and one where Vanessa
and Danny prove to be very human creatures, who are worth caring about.
Though the part where he ends up in Istanbul selling his knives, after
his luck (Adele) ran out, didn't convince me that he so suddenly lost
his edge on life and therefore it made me rethink what I was asked to
believe about the two lost souls. What I still came up with, is that
they are both good at flirting with disaster, but what they both have in
spades, is a whimsical sense of humor and a strange sense of survival,
and just like Serge Frydman's script, which was both witty and
superfluous, the film nevertheless succeeded in sucking me into its
story, a story which probably implied more about it than it actually
delivered. But, despite this and that about it that seemed to me as if
it was drifting off into the territory of play acting, I still thought
it was a smart film.</P>
