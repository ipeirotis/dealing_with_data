<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Edward L. Cahn's Four Skulls is a rather humorless and flat horror
story, but it's blessed with a wonderful title. This one is played
straight and involves a white family of former South American traders
trying to combat a 200 year curse placed literally on their heads by an
Amazon witch doctor.</P>
<P>The story opens as a passage from a book is highlighted- "The evil men
do lives after them." We then see Jonathan Drake (Franz), the eldest
male descendant of the cursed Drake family, having a strange vision of
skulls flying towards him, and he interprets that to mean that his
brother Ken (Cavanagh) is in grave danger. But he learns that he is too
late to save him. When he visits him, he finds that his brother is dead
and the cause is listed as a heart attack. But when the coffin is
opened, it is revealed that his head is missing.</P>
<P>Lt. Jeff Rowan (Grant) plays the cop who just wants the facts and
doesn't believe in all that supernatural stuff. He is in charge of the
case, which is now listed as murder because of the decapitation.</P>
<P>Alison Drake (Valerie) is the sophisticated daughter of Jonathan, who is
not too aware of the occult, even though her 60-year-old father is a
professor of the occult and has studied it his entire life. He has
studied it so that he can learn enough about it and thereby put an end
to the dreaded curse placed on his family.</P>
<P>There are now three skulls from the Drake family- Captain Wilfred Drake,
Jonathan's 60-year-old grandfather, the Amazon trader, who 200 years-ago
killed off a whole tribe of Amazon Indians except for one person, a
witch doctor, who originated the curse on the family. And, there is the
second skull of Jonathan's 60-year-old father.</P>
<P>It only seems amazing that Alison was kept in the dark about the curse
and only learns of it now. You would think her old man would tell her
about something as important as that.</P>
<P>In Alison's conversation with her father, a most interesting concept is
presented, as Jonathan suggests, "Suppose the power of good dies after
the mind dies-then only the evil lives."This challenging idea was never
really followed through, as the film instead became a conventional
melodrama. But in the hands of someone more intellectually capable than
Cahn, there was the thread of a good story available, instead of
shooting for the mundane, the reliance on the creepiness of the killer
and the spectacle of seeing a head shrunk to tell the story.</P>
<P>Since Jonathan is slated to be the next victim of the curse, he tells
his daughter about the curse's history, and takes her into the family
vault for the first time, showing her where the two previous skulls have
been kept. He also presents her with the only key to the vault, telling
her she's now in charge of the family treasures.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the skeptical Lt. Rowan is starting to believe that he is not
on an ordinary case, after going to the vault with Alison and finding a
third skull there, even though she is the only one with the key to it,
he starts to wonder what's going on here.</P>
<P>Jonathan is attacked and pierced in the neck with a stiletto, by a
zombie-like Indian, with long black hair, whose mouth is sewn tight,
with the stitches visibly showing, who climbed into his bedroom window,
wearing fashionable sandals made from human skin. He is saved only
because the servant Rogers (Lumsden) just entered the bedroom and
immediately called Dr. Bradford (Wendell).</P>
<P>When Lt. Rowan arrives, he spots the stab wound on the neck of Jonathan
and rushes off a sample of the blood to the police science lab. The
report comes back that there is a poison in the blood that is found only
in the Amazon. Dr. Bradford is, thusly, able to come up with an antidote
and save the professor's life.</P>
<P>Dr. Bradford suspects that a Dr. Zurich (Daniell) knows something about
this poison, being that he is a Swiss (notice that his name is Zurich)
archeologist, specializing in the occult. In Zurich's home Bradford
spots all the apparatus for the head-hunter's shrinking process, and
Zurich, who is only a ghost, but in reality, he is the witch doctor who
stayed immortal by having an Amazon priest attach his white head to a
brown body, tells Bradford the correct way to remove the head from the
skull so that the soul doesn't escape. The soul of the victim is
essential to save, because that is the spark of life that kept the enemy
alive. It is what gives one immortality. He goes on to describe the
shrinking process, of putting the head into a mixture of hot sand,
heated pebbles, and smoke-and then the slow-heating process takes place.
Dr. Bradford will have his head shrunk and be placed on Zurich's lab
mantelpiece, as he is so richly rewarded for being the first in the
movie to discover the culprit responsible for carrying out the curse.</P>
<P>Rowan is now convinced that he is dealing with an occult crime, so he
visits the renown Dr. Zurich, and he discovers on the rug a blood stain.
Zurich realizes that the police are on his trail, so he tells Zutai
(Wexler), the spooky Indian servant of Zurich's, the one with the sewn
mouth, that they must get to Jonathan pronto (incidentally, this was
done to Zutai so that he can be immortal).</P>
<P>Zurich dresses up in his witch doctor outfit and the mute Zutai beats
the tom-toms, and by ritualistic magic, whatever comes into Zurich's
mind will now be seen by Jonathan. When he starts seeing those animated
four skulls suspended in space, poor Jonathan (he's actually quite
wealthy-get a load of that mansion he lives in), goes into shock and is
rushed to the hospital.</P>
<P>The wind down to the film is rather unimaginative, as what is expected
comes about, with a few more explanations thrown in to further explain
how the curse must be carried out in order for Zurich to remain
immortal. If Jonathan should take his own life, then Zurich cannot
fulfill the curse. It is also explained that the only way to kill
Zurich, is to sever his white head from his brown body. Don't ask me
what this means symbolically!</P>
<P>It's too bad this film didn't have some more life to it. The best thing
that can be said about  it, is that it was competently made and was
somehow watchable. The actors are to be commiserated with and not
criticized, no actor could have done anything with the dry lines they
were handed. There is also a problem I had with all the victims having
to be sixty- Were Kent and his brother Jonathan the same age? It was
never mentioned if they were twins or not.</P>
