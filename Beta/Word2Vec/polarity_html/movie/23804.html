<P>     At first glance, there's every reason to believe John Cusack is the
ideal cast for Rob Gordon, the protagonist of HIGH FIDELITY. A single,
likeable, somewhat directionless guy in his early 30s, Rob spends his days
hawking the archaic music format of vinyl in his shop Championship Vinyl,
then spends his nights obsessing over his failed relationships. Throughout
HIGH FIDELITY, Rob narrates his story directly to the audience, describing
his troubles with his soon-to-be-latest-ex Laura (Iben Hjejle) and Laura's
place in his catalog of break-up stories. Few actors could pull off the
amount of narration required of Rob without becoming instantly annoying; 
even fewer could make self-absorption somewhat sympathetic. </P>
<P>     So why does Cusack seem ever-so-slightly wrong in a role that should
be so right? It's not the sharp comic setting crafted by director Stephen
Frears and a team of four writers (adapting Nick Hornby's novel). That
setting finds Rob and his co-workers Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd
Louiso) holding court in Championship Vinyl, mocking customers for their
lack of musical acumen and exchanging Top Five lists of best songs in
detailed categories (e.g., Top Five Side-One, Song-One Tracks). Cusack is
fine as the saner center, but his co-stars are superb. Black's Barry is an
aggressive, abrasive pedant who delights in the power of dispensing arcana
or withholding a rare record; Louiso's Dick is a portrait in awed fan-geek
deference. When the Championship crew is rattling off obscure band
influences or rattling customers with their disdain, HIGH FIDELITY finds
its highest energy.</P>
<P>     It's not the focus on Rob's relationship history, either. Rob
recounts his woman woes in search of a pattern to his failed love affairs,
allowing for some great moments of comic humiliation (and a couple of
priceless fantasy sequences). It also allows for a parade of familiar
faces in extended cameos: Tim Robbins as Laura's other man; Lili Taylor as
one needy ex; Catherine Zeta-Jones as another, more intimidating ex; even
Bruce Springsteen pops up to offer advice. The gimmicky casting is
occasionally distracting, but not so much so that it overwhelms the
strengths of the individual episodes. There's even some charming wisdom in
HIGH FIDELITY's acknowledgement that middle school make-out sessions can
stay with you for life, or that a skillfully made mix tape can speak from
the heart.</P>
<P>     No, the one key problem with an otherwise thoroughly entertaining
film is that Cusack's screen persona is just too ... nice. Rob is a
somewhat unreliable narrator, since it is gradually revealed that he's
caused just as much emotional damage as has been done to him. One breakup
inspired by his own sexual frustration has morphed in his mind into the
woman's fault; he acknowledges having cheated on Laura while they were
together; he sleeps with a singer (Lisa Bonet) even as he's fuming over
Laura's involvement with another man while they're separated. Combine his
romantic irresponsibility with his musical snobbery, and you've got a
character that should be played with more jerkish, immature edge. With
Cusack, the nice guy is too dominant. Rob's confessions -- which should
have played as calculated attempts to win us to his side -- feel more like
guileless soul-baring coming from Cusack's mouth. And they never quite
feel right.</P>
<P>     In the end, Rob learns some valuable lessons and starts to grow up a
little. It's only then that you can feel enthusiastic about wishing for
Rob's happiness. HIGH FIDELITY's sharp wit could have made up for a
multitude of sins, when in fact it only has to make up for one; there's
more than enough quality film-making to weigh in the film's favor. There's
also that nagging realiation that Rob's not the good-natured hero we all
want him to be when John Cusack is playing the part. Cusack has proven
himself to be a talented, versatile actor, but there's a guy we've come to
know and love in off-beat romantic comedies like THE SURE THING, SAY
ANYTHING and GROSSE POINTE BLANK, and it's hard not to listen to  Cusack
reveal personal traumas without expecting that guy. Even when HIGH 
FIDELITY is at its most inspired, you can tell that Rob Gordon isn't that
guy.</P>
