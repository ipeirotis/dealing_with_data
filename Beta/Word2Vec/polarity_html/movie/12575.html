<PRE>COUSIN BETTE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     So what has happened to Jessica Lange.  Her acting in her last
project, the atrocious HUSH, was ridiculously off-the-wall, and her
work in the one before that, A THOUSAND ACRES, wasn't much better.  Her
new picture, a screen adaptation of the great Balzac novel, "Cousin
Bette," finds her badly miscast.  In contemporary films like BLUE SKY
and THE MUSIC BOX, her talents have shone, but in a costume drama about
nineteenth century manners, she and her costar Elisabeth Shue are
awkward and out of place.</P>
<P>     Anyone who has ever seen the BBC miniseries will be bitterly
disappointed by the movie COUSIN BETTE.  Whereas the television version
had interesting characters with some considerable depth, the movie
version, as scripted by Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr, is as flat and
blandly modern as the nightly news and as shallow as a comedy sketch.</P>
<P>     Director Des McAnuff stages the scenes confusingly so that people
who have not read the novel may have trouble keeping up with the
meandering storyline.  The superficial film seems to try for a light
parody, but mainly the story just drifts.  Some scenes are so bad they
are good.  The "best" of these has Shue and one of her lovers covered
in lumpy, gooey chocolate as a sexual turn-on.  (This is certainly not
your father's COUSIN BETTE.  Balzac is probably turning over in his
grave.)</P>
<P>     Dressed in drab olive greens and dingy blues, Jessica Lange is
Bette, the show's manipulative protagonist.  A voluptuous Elisabeth
Shue plays burlesque actress Jenny Cadine.</P>
<P>     As the story opens, Geraldine Chaplin shows up so that she can
quickly die and leave her relatives to squabble over her luxurious
estate and to squander her fortune.  Bette goes off to make her life as
a seamstress since she does not receive a cut of the money or the
estate.  She spends the rest of the movie getting even with her
relatives for not sharing.</P>
<P>     Typical of the overly cute staging is the scene in which Jenny and
Bette first meet.  As Jenny's seamstress, Bette cuts off the entire
buttocks area of Jenny's costume.  This makes the already popular
actress even more so.  Nothing like bare buns to excite the nineteenth
century masses.  (There goes Balzac turning over again.)</P>
<P>     Simon Boswell's loud and pervasive music has all the subtlety of
the "Pomp and Circumstance March."  Although it overwhelms the
production, at least it is of consistently good quality - listening to
it is just like sitting in the drawing rooms of the nineteenth century
rich and famous and enjoying a live concert.</P>
<P>     "Life is so boring, don't you think?" Bette remarks to Jenny right
before the director cuts to a scene of the Parisian rebellion in the
streets.  This movie version of the rich and wonderful Balzac novel has
so little to recommend it that it is, indeed, quite boring.</P>
<P>     COUSIN BETTE runs 1:50.  It is rated R for brief scenes of sex,
nudity, and violence and would be fine for most teenagers.</P>
