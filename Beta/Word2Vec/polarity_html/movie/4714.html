<P>     It's probably just a coincidence, but the two Bond films that Maud 
Adams appeared in -- THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and OCTOPUSSY -- are 
easily the silliest entries in the long-running series (not counting the 
intentional spoof CASINO ROYALE).  In a duel of dumb storylines, 
OCTOPUSSY loses, but only by a length.  There's a fine line between wit 
and absurdity, and this particular movie too often falls on the wrong 
side.</P>
<P>     1983 was the year of competing Bonds -- Connery against Moore; 
NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN against OCTOPUSSY (the thirteenth "official" 
entry).  Even though Connery's return was a remake of THUNDERBALL and 
didn't have the John Barry/Monty Norman theme music, it was still better 
than OCTOPUSSY.  After twelve years off, Connery was up for playing 007 
again.  Moore, on the other hand, had been at it for a decade, and was 
just going through the motions.  Fatuousness replaced flair.   Bond, 
never the most rounded character at the best of times, had become a 
caricature of himself.</P>
<P>     The plot for OCTOPUSSY is so circuitous and convoluted that it 
doesn't make much sense.  Bond movies are at their best when they have a 
straightforward storyline -- viewers don't want to piece together 
different aspects of the film.  However, even deep thought won't resolve 
all of OCTOPUSSY's tangled plot knots.  This movie mixes jewel 
smuggling, counterfeiting, a circus traveling through East Germany, and 
a maverick Soviet general bent on setting off an atomic bomb.  Who else 
can the British government call upon than 007 to get to the bottom of 
matters?</P>
<P>     There are two "top" villains in OCTOPUSSY:  Kamal (Louis Jourdan), 
the smooth head of the smuggling/counterfeiting operation, and General 
Orlov (Steven Berkoff), the cold warrior who believes the time is ripe 
for a Soviet invasion of the West.  While Jourdan is deliciously cool, 
Berkoff gives the worst performance, bar none, of any Bond bad guy.  
While a certain element of over-the-top acting is expected from everyone 
in a 007 adventure, Berkoff does an offensively bad job that renders 
every scene he's in almost unwatchable.</P>
<P>     Despite having the title role, Maud Adams doesn't have much more to 
do than in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.  The film's second Bond girl, 
Magda (Kristina Wayborn) is equally in the background.  This isn't a 
film where 007 is especially concerned with the women, except to slip 
into and out of their beds.  The on-screen camaraderie shared by Moore 
and his leading ladies since THE SPY WHO LOVED ME died with OCTOPUSSY.  </P>
<P>     The film moves from India to Cuba to Germany.  The most foolish 
elements of the film include a bizarre chase through the streets of New 
Delhi, Bond doing a Tarzan imitation, and an attack by circus performers 
on the villain's hideout.  007 has a variety of disguises here, 
including a mechanical crocodile, a gorilla suit, and a clown costume.  
OCTOPUSSY has its funny moments, but there are a few too many times when 
we're laughing at the movie rather than with it.  </P>
<P>     Ultimately, it's the extravagant stunts and chases that save 
OCTOPUSSY from the scrap heap.  The pre-credits episode features a 
stunning race between a 12-foot long jet and a heat-seeking missile.  
Later in the film, there's a pulse-pounding chase-and-battle sequence 
that takes place on the roof of a moving train.  The climactic struggle 
manages to top that, transpiring on a plane in flight.</P>
<P>     After OCTOPUSSY, Roger Moore announced his intention to retire from 
the role.  Considering his lackluster performance here, which is at 
least partially responsible for this film's absence of flair and energy, 
the decision seemed appropriate.  Ultimately, however, Moore returned 
for one more outing, and, while that film (A VIEW TO A KILL) wasn't a 
positive triumph, it at least gave the actor a better story with which 
to depart.</P>
