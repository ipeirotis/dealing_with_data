<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>To make artistic films in a repressed country is very difficult, but to
make documentaries   for an amateur filmmaker can work simply because he
is an amateur and is not expected to be after something politically
dangerous, therefore he is thought of as less of a risk to those
governments.</P>
<P>This film is about how a factory worker, Philip Mosz (Stuhr), who bought
himself a cheap hand-held 8 mm Russian camera (costing him two months
salary) for the birth of his daughter to record her birth and infant
years. His boss (Stefan Czyzewski) spotted the camera and asked him to
make a movie about the factory. From that humble beginning, as soon as
Philip felt the things he could do with the camera, he knew that this
would be his vocation. He thought he could make a difference in society
by pointing out how things really are, exposing any corruption, and
giving people a record of how they are living.</P>
<P>Kieslowski went from making documentaries to making this fictional film,
and in some ways this film is semi-autobiographical, as it is about what
power there is in the camera, especially for one who is an artist.</P>
<P>Philip is the central focus of the film, as he undergoes a
transformation of personality. We first see him as a picture of
contentment: he is satisfied with his job as a procurer, travelling
around Poland buying products for his factory, and we see him satisfied
with his marriage--he even mentions, "If someone wants only one thing in
life, he'll get it." And he shares with his wife what they both wanted,
a simple and quiet existence.</P>
<P>When he shows the completed film to his boss about factory life, it is
met with approval except for four minor changes the boss insists upon.
The naive new filmmaker has no qualms about getting rid of the pigeons,
but he doesn't understand why he can't leave in the film the men coming
out of the lavatory, or the men taking money behind a curtain, or
showing the little man with glasses in many of the scenes.</P>
<P>After winning third prize for the film in a contest sponsored by the
film club, the movie bug has really bitten him. He has joined the film
club where he gets romantically interested in one of the club leaders,
Ana (Ewa), who makes it her personal business to see that he gets help
in his new film career. His wife becomes displeased with him for
spending so much time away from the family and threatens to walk out on
him, which she will shortly do. But Philip can't stop filming anything
that moves, as his techniques and artistic plans grow. To get help, the
club introduces him to Krzysztof Zanussi for advice and to have the
famous director talk to his film club, and they also get him a meeting
with Andrzej Jurga, who tells him to make a film about a worker and
he'll see that it gets on TV. This turns out to be a bitter-sweet trap
for Philip, because he gets his work on TV and it is met with success by
his friends and neighbors who watched it, but his boss is displeased
that it is about a cripple in the factory, and does not blame Philip for
doing it because he is young, but blames his superior, the elderly and
kind-hearted Osuch (Nowak), whom he forces to resign his post as head of
culture and coerces him into early retirement. It seems that even though
he didn't intend to, he hurts those who are not responsible for what he
does.</P>
<P>This is a political spoof on the artist's role and limits in Communist
Poland and a comedy, as it comically exaggerates the film buff's growing
pathology and voyeuristic tendencies. The power in the story was in the
subtle reminders, showing that behind the obvious censorship, there is a
real censorship problem for everyone, it is not only in the conflicts
between the artist and the authorities-- but, for both the artist and
the viewer who must demand that the truth and integrity of the work be
preserved. Poland is a good example of such a battlefield, with the then
state-owned film industry in charge of funding projects, documentary
films are sometimes the best records of such history, unless you have
the artistic deftness, like Kieslowski has shown, to make a film as
wickedly ironical as this one is and get it past the censors.</P>
<P>Since the film's theme has been done many times before, and the comic
efforts of the film were rather flat, what made this film provocative,
was the absorbing performance by Jerzy Stuhr, who would become a regular
in many of the director's later films, which spanned a career of over 20
years. Stuhr was able to make this political tale into a human interest
story, something that deceptively caught the artist's struggle,
highlighting the conflict over his compulsion to film and his personal
sacrifice of losing his family.</P>
<P>For the filmmaker, as Kieslowski sees it, home-life is secondary. And
for showing that struggle through Stuhr's eyes, the film is memorable,
though it is not one of the director's top-flight artistic works, yet it
is still worth seeing.</P>
