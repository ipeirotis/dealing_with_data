<P>     The first half of Mike Figgis' ONE NIGHT STAND contains some of the
most effective film-making moments to hit American screens this year, yet
even at the outset it's obvious that Figgis isn't working at his sharpest.
The film opens with protagonist Max Carlyle (Wesley Snipes) directly
addressing the audience as he walks down a Manhattan street.  He relates
to us that he's a successful L.A.-based television commercial director,
happily married with children and hoplessly straight, though some of his
best friends are gay.  In fact, the reason he's in New York is to mend
fences with Charlie Reevis (Robert Downey Jr.), an estranged gay buddy Max
just learned has AIDS.  It's a lazy narrative device which allows Figgis
five minutes of screen time to re-hash the press notes before allowing Max
to finish with a portentous "We'll see what happens."</P>
<P>     What happens, at least for nearly an hour, is a marvelously detailed
portrait of an isolated infidelity and what it means to a man's life.  In
his New York hotel, Max meets a beautiful woman named Karen (Nastassja
Kinski), then ends up spending the evening in her company after missing
his flight back to California.  One string quartet concert and a thwarted
mugging later, Max and Karen are sharing a bed, and a sexual encounter
staged with tremendous eloquence.  The sequence lingers and builds,
showing the participants taking tentative steps while fooling themselves
that each subsequent step is as far as they will go.</P>
<P>    The scenes between Max and Karen are tantalizing, but they're also
risky, since Figgis is showing us an act of adultery without first
providing much context to build sympathy for the characters.  That doesn't
happen until Max returns to Los Angeles, and we get a chance to see him
with his wife Mimi (Ming-Na Wen).  In one outrageous and hilarious scene,
Figgis shows Mimi ordering Max through a fast and furious bout of
lovemaking.  The two sex scenes in ONE NIGHT STAND are probably the most
disparate I've seen in a single film, and the most uniquely effective.
Max's shallow, romanceless life unfolds gradually, allowing the
significance of his one night stand to build in our minds even as it
builds in his.</P>
<P>     All is well in ONE NIGHT STAND until the words "One Year Later"
appear on the screen, at which point the film begins to disintegrate like
a bad marriage.  In part, the casting of Snipes in the lead role is
responsible.  Snipes is a reliable performer, but he never seems entirely
in touch with this character.  To be fair, Figgis has written the part as
the most guilt-wracked, angst-filled and introspective soul this side of
Hamlet.  Max spends much of the second half of ONE NIGHT STAND wandering
about in a heavy-lidded daze, ever on the verge of bursting into a
profound soliloquy.  There are a couple of solid moments between Snipes
and Downey (affecting and acerbic as the terminally ill Charlie), but at a
certain point, 45 minutes in anticipation of a life-changing revelation
feels like about 30 minutes too many.</P>
<P>     The blame for that belongs entirely with Figgis, who can't hold the
level of interest built by the film's first half.  At turns he opts either
to tell too much (in Snipes' opening monologue) or too little (in most of
the second hour).  It's a story which hints and teases, then offers a
resolution which asks for a tremendous leap of faith as to the
compatibility of certain characters.  What begins as honest and probing
turns sluggish, predictable and coy.  ONE NIGHT STAND is at its most
provocative when it finds a man beginning to question everything
fundamental in his life.  Sooner or later, for our sake if not for his
own, he needs to stop questioning and actually do something.  Snipes as
the melancholy Dane isn't the stuff of which great drama is made.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 high infidelities:  5.</PRE>
