<PRE>                                HARD EIGHT
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Clementine (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a waitress and hooker who has a
brain the size of a small reptile.  She has recently married small time
gambler John (John C. Reilly), whose IQ is a perfect match for hers.
The night after their wedding finds them not having much luck.  Her
trick has refused to pay her $300 fee, so Clementine and John get rough
with him.  After handcuffing him and pistol-whipping him, they call his
wife to demand Clementine's hard earned cash.</P>
<P>     When this scheme goes awry, John calls his mentor Sydney (Philip
Baker Hall) to bail them out.  Ever laconic John tries to get them out
of their predicament.  This claustrophobic scene, which makes up the
second act of the movie HARD EIGHT, feels as if it will never end, but
at least something is happening, albeit painfully slowly.</P>
<P>     The first act of the movie is much worse.  The acting is superb,
the problem throughout the picture is the script and the directing by
first-time writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson.  Anderson writes
and directs in the style of David Mammet (HOUSE OF GAMES), but he lacks
Mammet's talent and insight.  Mammet's characters speak in staccato
cadence with lines full of power.  Anderson's characters have little to
say, and he makes sure they enunciate the words slowly so that we can
ponder their non-meanings.  Anderson's languid film noir may start a
new genre of dark and inane pictures.</P>
<P>     The film alternates between leaden prose and pregnant pauses.
"I have the money now, this moment," Sid tells Jimmy (Samuel L.
Jackson).  "I will give you all that I have."  I found myself wondering
what grade the script would get in a film school.  Would the teacher be
charitable and just suggest a rewrite or would it be deemed hopeless?</P>
<P>     Cinematographer Robert Elswit is fond of still lifes.  His camera
lingers on close-ups of ashtrays full of burnt-out cigarettes and ashes
to symbolize the character's lifestyles.  Most of the scenes happen in
Nevada's inexpensive casinos and hotels.  His gritty and garish images
of them make them menacing and lonely.</P>
<P>     HARD EIGHT is a comedy without humor, a tragedy without emotion,
and a story without meaning.  Notwithstanding these flaws, the acting
is uniformly good with my favorite being the stoic performance by
Philip Baker Hall.</P>
<P>     HARD EIGHT becomes an endurance test for the audience.  Will a
hundred people stick around for almost two hours hoping that sooner or
later something will happen.  In HARD EIGHT something eventually does,
but was it worth the pain?  I think not.  I talked to another critic
after the screening, and he said he thought about walking out on the
film.  I must admit, I was similarly tempted.</P>
<P>     HARD EIGHT runs 1:41.  It is rated R for violence and non-stop
profanity.  The show would be acceptable for most teenagers.  I do not
recommend the picture, and I give it * 1/2 only for the acting.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
