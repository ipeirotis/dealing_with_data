<PRE>Review: The Beach (2000)
By: Matt Petras</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: *1/2 out of ****
Length: 118 minutes</PRE>
<P>Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume
Canet, Robert Carlyle
Director: Danny Boyle
Producer(s): Andrew Macdonald, Callum McDougall</P>
<P>        Disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life, Richard
(Leonardo DiCaprio) sets off for Thailand. There he a meets crazed man
by the name of Daffy (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a Beach,
a secret utopia, then commits suicide. Richard sets off for this beach
with his neighbors from this hotel, Étienne (Guillaume Canet) and
Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen). Once they get there the three discover a
secret society existing on this beach, there Richard falls for
Françoise. This covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside
from the romantic element, which is solely a creation of Hollywood,
seems to hold to the original novel.</P>
<P>        The cinematography and general beauty of this part of the
movie is breathtaking. I don't think anyone can argue that this movie
is visually stunning. But that is were many things go wrong, Darius
Khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography.
Though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite
lacking. The plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about
half of the movie or there abouts. This is where the movie has some
great potential, then the three travelers get the island and there is
a turn for the better, yes folks I said better. Now up to about two
thirds of this movie its actually pretty good, nothing spectacular
aside from the cinematography but it still has promise. This is where
things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost
un-watchable. There is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders
on the disgusting, it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks
dumb in my opinion (and I am hoping many other peoples). I am hoping
that in my little rant I've made it abundantly clear that the movie is
lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing, so if you go see it
and you don't like it because of this don't blame me. </P>
<P>The character development was not up to par either; I found the
character of Richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child. Although
there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails
and Richard (Leo's character) comes off as a wannabe philosopher. The
character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just
do things for no apparent reason, granted some people are like this
(myself included) but I nor anyone I know that is fairly random would
ever do things of the sort this character does. The next point is that
some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed
enough. Richard is obviously obsessed by Françoise at the early stages
of the story, yet there is actually very little development along this
story line. This I am sure contributes to the movie's lack of core
plot and being unfocused.        
Now, I shall move onto something a little better about the movie (for
all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about
it). The cast and acting was passable at the very least, and I think
that Leonardo DiCaprio actually did pretty well in the role of
Richard. Mind you I think the rest of the cast that had some which had
reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better. Which begs the
question why is Leonardo paid so much? (I think this is a topic all on
its own so I won't get into it). But I like the fact that there was an
international cast used, had only and American cast been used I can
see this movie being horrible. The international flavor added a more
global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable. Not to
mention the movie is set in Thailand and a global cast makes more
sense. </P>
<P>        When all is said and done I liked the movie for the most part
but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable. I would not
recommend this movie to anyone, the fact that I liked it has a lot to
do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its
plot or story. As it is the story tries to be much too philosophical
and fails at its attempt. If you do end up going to see this movie be
forewarned about its shortcomings.</P>
