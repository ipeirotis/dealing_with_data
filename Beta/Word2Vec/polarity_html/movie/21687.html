<P>     Watching SLEEPY HOLLOW, you realize that Tim Burton could have made a
definitive masterwork about the Headless Horseman...if anyone had given
him a script that was actually about the Headless Horseman. Changing
source material -- even radically changing source material -- is nothing
new in Hollywood, so it's not terribly surprising to find only a passing
resemblance between the film and Washington Irving's classic ghost story.
It is both surprising and inevitably disappointing to discover that the
classic ghost story has been turned into a whodunnit. There is plenty of
splendid, grisly entertainment in Burton's brand of quirky gothic horror,
but it's bogged down in a story that's a cross between a parlor mystery
and an episode of "Scooby Doo."</P>
<P>     The story's protagonist is still named Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp),
but in SLEEPY HOLLOW Crane is a turn-of-the-19th-century New York City
constable dedicated to logical investigation and his own early
explorations into forensic science. After a clash with a local judge, he's
sent off to the remote upstate hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, where three people
have already been found decapitated. The town fathers, including wealthy
citizen Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), believe the murders to be the
work of a legendary Headless Horseman who haunts the area, but the
skeptical Crane is unconvinced. It is only after his own encounter with
the spectral figure that Crane changes the focus of his investigation from
"who" to "why."</P>
<P>     From its very first moments, SLEEPY HOLLOW shows tremendous promise.
The deaths of two of the Horseman's victims -- including Martin Landau in
a cameo as a Sleepy Hollow landowner -- lead into the introduction of
Crane as a jittery opponent of brutality in the name of justice. Depp is
rarely better than when he works with Burton (EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED
WOOD). Here he's an eccentric revelation as the big city rationalist
coping with supernatural phenomena. Depp has a ridiculous amount of fun
with Crane's prissiness, and Burton gets lots of mileage out of spraying
him with blood. Burton gets even more mileage out of the spectacular look
of SLEEPY HOLLOW, from the twisted woods to the gloomy town. He nails the
spooky side of the story, combining effective action with flying body
parts a-plenty whenever the Headless Horseman is at the center of the
narrative.</P>
<P>    Unfortunately, he's not at the center of the narrative nearly often
enough. Eventually, the film becomes focused on Crane's efforts to
understand the connection between the victims and who might be controlling
the Horseman. Crane methodically pieces together clues, notes suspects and
ponders motives...and I wonder who might possibly care. The question of
the head behind the Headless Horseman not only becomes an irritating
distraction -- and means you can count on a tedious expository scene of
the villain explaining his/her plan in excruciating detail -- it robs the
Horseman of too much power. Andrew Kevin Walker's script (tweaked by Tom
Stoppard) turns a primally frightening apparition into little more than
hired muscle from beyond the grave. Other plot elements prove burdensome
as well -- radically changing the role of Van Tassel's daughter Katrina
(Christina Ricci), exploring Crane's dark childhood secrets -- but nothing
is so ill-advised as blunting the force of the Horseman.</P>
<P>     I suppose that one glaring misstep is so troubling because SLEEPY
HOLLOW has so much going for it as one of Burton's typically grim fairy
tales. Between the delights of Depp's performance and the dark enchantment
of the production design, it's easy to start feeling the potential for
brilliance. You only need to feel the energy level rise when the Horseman
is on screen to understand that detective work didn't really belong in
this story. SLEEPY HOLLOW may be somebody's idea of "fleshing out"
Washington Irving's story, but what it really needed was less flesh and
more ectoplasm. Burton has made a wonderful monster movie from a script
that doesn't understand this is a monster movie.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 head games:  7.</PRE>
