<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The perfect storm is based on Sebastian Junger's best-selling nonfiction
book. It is about a Gloucester, Mass., fishing skipper, Billy Tyne
(George Clooney), and his five-man crew aboard a small swordfishing
boat, the Andrea Gail, who go out deep into the North Atlantic, to a
place where they never fished before, a place that is almost off their
fishing map, called the Flemish Cap, because the captain is in a fishing
slump and must protect his reputation and he knows there are fish in
those waters. It's all about money and pride.</P>
<P>The film is long on man-against-nature action scenes filmed with graphic
computerized special effects, but short on character development and
human drama. It is a commercial film, driven by the usual formula used
for disaster movies. It is directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the German
director of "Das Boot," the best submarine picture ever made. The film
succeeds as a nail-biter. It paints a real picture of the fishing town
and how tough it is to exist for the fishermen: economically, family
wise, and because of the inherent dangers of the profession. So when the
men battle the storm at sea, we are affected by their struggle to
survive.</P>
<P>In 1991, on Halloween, the Great Nor'easter occurred out in the Atlantic
Ocean, it was described by meteorologists as something that they never
saw happen before in this century, two hurricane weather fronts
combining as one, which they called the perfect storm. The crew aboard
the Andrea Gail, consisting of: Murph (Reilly), a good-hearted soul, who
is separated from his wife and young son, losing them to his
professional duties, even though he loves both of them dearly -- but
commercial fishermen on swordfishing boats go out to sea for as long as
a month at a time and he loses touch with his wife after those long
absences; Bugsy (Hawkes), who is someone searching desperately for any
woman, in any port; Alfred (Payne), the lone black man aboard; Sully
(Fichtner), the wiseguy with a chip on his shoulder, but who proves
himself heroic when he helps rescue his rival Murph, who fell
overboard--he is a replacement for another crew member who refused to
go; Bobby (Wahlberg), who reluctantly casts out after much doubt about
this fishing trip since he just came back from being out for a long
time. He is in love with the perfect girl, Christina (Lane), and needs
money both to pay his ex-wife for child support and for his upcoming
marriage to Christina. One day he wants to be his own skipper--he has
the only natural New England accent in the film; and, lastly, there is
the skipper, Bill Tyne, who is separated from his wife and two
daughters, whose love for the sea and his skills as a captain shouldn't
be questioned.</P>
<P>Once the storm blows and these men are caught in it, the men become
secondary figures and the storm takes over as the film's star. Most of
the second-half of the film is taken over by computer graphics, as we
witness the boat trying to make it back home amid gigantic waves of over
100-feet covering the boat and of winds of over fifty miles per hour.
Our sympathy for the men is somewhat diminished by their choice of not
sitting out the storm in the safe waters where they were, but on
insisting on returning home through the storm because their ice machine
broke. If they remained put, their great haul of fish would be
destroyed. The men were clearly driven by greed, and the captain might
be intrepid, but he made a dumb decision listening to his crew. The only
real heroes in this movie were the Air Force and Coast Guard rescuers,
who risked their lives to save these foolhardy men and pull from the sea
three members of a yacht caught in the same waters.</P>
<P>When their vessel is down, Bobby tells the captain, we gave it good
ride...words that seem futile and misplaced, though certainly gallant.
But it is the only glimmer of intelligent dialogue that appeared to be
taking place in the last 45-minutes, ever since the giant waves crested
against the boat and the men could only be seen in the dark with their
yellow slickers.</P>
<P>Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the captain of the Andrea Gail's sister
ship, the
Hannah Boden, and she is more than a friend to Captain Tyne; while,
Michael Ironside is the man who owns both boats. All the side stories
are superfluous to the storm.</P>
<P>Even though the film has a bleak ending and awkward dialogue, it has
blockbuster written all over its sails. I think the public will accept
the grim outcome and relish viewing the storm and the terrible damage it
causes, because it is the kind of action film they will want to see this
summer, while they munch on some popcorn in an air-conditioned theater.</P>
