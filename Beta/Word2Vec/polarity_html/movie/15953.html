<PRE>BELOVED (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Jonathan Demme
Writers: Akosua Busia, Richard LaGravenese, and Adam Brooks (based on
the novel by Toni Morrison)
Starring: Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Kimberly Elise,
Beah Richards, Lisa Gay Hamilton, Albert Hall, Irma P. Hall</P>
<P>Since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what
they're portraying, it's fitting to say that "Beloved" come as a real
shock as a film.  It's confusing, bizarre, and as tough a film to watch
as any film I've seen all year, and that's not necessarily because of
the three-hour running time.  "Beloved" is challenging to watch, filled
with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard, and
instead of a straight-forward, Hollywood-ized story about what happened
to the slaves after they were freed, "Beloved" comes off as a cry of
anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened (or,
rather, Toni Morrison, who wrote the novel upon which this is based).</P>
<P>"Beloved" tells the story of an ex-slave named Sethe, played by Oprah
Winfrey, who lives on a large farm in the north with her children.  When
the film opens, her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist, which
shakes things up, wounds the dog, and makes things generally
uncomfortable for the family.  Sethe is proud, though, and will not
move.  Her sons run away, leaving only her and her daughter, Denver
(Kimberly Elise) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual
explanation.</P>
<P>A couple years pass, and the ghost remains, and one day, a man named
Paul D (Danny Glover), another ex-slave who knew Sethe years ago when
they worked on a plantation together, arrives, asking for lodging.  He
has been wandering around since he left the plantation, and when he
enters the house, it turns red and becomes incredibly hot.  When he
remarks about what he thinks is evil, Sethe replies "It ain't evil.
It's just sad."</P>
<P>Some more time passes, and Paul D has become a fervent member of the
household, and the ghost disappears.  But when they return one day from
going out, they discover a young woman sitting in the house.  Her name
is Beloved, and as played by Thandie Newton, she has almost zero motor
skills.  She stumbles around, half-grabbing onto things and knocking
them over, and when she speaks, she lets out a low guttural sound that
eventually turns into baby talk.  They let her into her house, and she
begins to turn things upside down.</P>
<P>"Beloved" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a
ghost story.  Most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one
claustrophobic, low-lit room, with the occasional flash to the past,
where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day
psychoanalysts.  Sethe and Paul D have lived through such hellish times
that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on
the old plantation, which includes such images as Sethe being raped by
the white plantation hands, with her nipples being licked, prompting her
to cry out to Paul D when reminiscing about it, "They took my milk!"</P>
<P>Worst of all was the month after her freedom, when she was allowed to
live like a free person, working with other blacks on a farm, and then
seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take
her and her children back.  She runs to the barn near by, carrying her
four children, and when her old owners burst in, they discover she has
murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they
don't leave them alone.  When she is inquired about this moment by Paul
D in a moment halfway through the film, she says she doesn't regret it.
She killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the
horror she did, and she has convinced herself she did the right thing.</P>
<P>Of course, Beloved is really her daugher materialized, though we aren't
flat out told that until later on in the film.  Beloved represents the
pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it
was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so
long.  Thus, "Beloved" becomes a sorta-redux of the Andrei Tarkofsky
sci-fi classic, "Solaris," where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife,
who commited suicide years before, has materialized when he is orbiting
over a planet with a complex brain system.  That film spoke volumes
about humanity and our memories, how we are constantly regretting what
happened in the past, and when if it ever literally came back to haunt
us, it would control us completely.</P>
<P>"Beloved" moves along freely, without a lot of explanation, and for the
most part, this is extremely respectable.  The most interesting films
are the ones that don't explain everything for us, leaving gaps in the
characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the
present tense.  Sethe is never fully explained as a character, but we
understand all her actions since she's being played by Oprah Winfrey.
It's been well over a decade since her last major performance in "The
Color Purple," but judging from these two films, I'll bet she's one of
the best actresses working today...if she was strictly an actress.  Her
talk show, which I suppose is a great entity, has prevented her from
becoming a noteworthy actress, and that's a shame because she brings so
much to this movie.  Emotion.  Sadness.  Strength.  Watching the strong
Sethe, who's so afraid of the past that she's built a rather strong
protective coating around herself, break down when she discovers who
Beloved really is is what makes this movie really great.  She makes it
real.</P>
<P>That's not to say this is a perfect film.  In fact, I'd wager to say
that the fact that it's confusing and painful to watch is what prevents
this from being the truly great film it is.  While Oprah's performance
is powerful and easily sympathetic (and I'm dying to see her win at
least an Oscar nomination this February), the structure of the film,
which doesn't show what happened to her children till halfway through
the film, prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the
film.  It doesn't necessarily move as though they're memories of one
particular character, and by the end, it has lost control over Sethe,
and as she takes to bed, we are unable to truly identify with her
anymore.</P>
<P>But despite its tediousness, perhaps that's the point.  The distancing
by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built
from the start, since they figure she has crossed over from being
identifiable, and it needs to get back with reality.  And for the most
part, this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it
really wants to be.  Jonathan Demme's direction is bizarre, in nature
with the story, and he creates the right mood, making it a tough film to
sit through, making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the
characters.</P>
<P>There's more to admire here, like the way that the flashbacks pop up
freely and without real organization, just like they would be in real
life; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain
and suffering, but laced with a touch of optimism.  The acting, not only
from Winfrey, is amazing, and I anticipate not only she will get an
Oscar nomination.  Everyone has been raving about Thandie Newton's
performance, and how it should be rewarded.  However, it must be noted
that out of everyone, she had the easiest part.  Act like a baby.  Throw
things.  Stumble around.  Chew food with your mouth open.  I do think
there's another performance worthy of Oscar conisderation, but it's
Kimberly Elise, as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane, and
has to carry the burden of her mother's loss of reality towards the
end.  It's not that Newton isn't great: she's as annoying and wacky as
the role demands.  It's just that Elise has the tougher job and pulls it
off even better.</P>
<P>Despite the fact that this film has Winfrey written all over it, and not
that of writer Morrison or director Demme, "Beloved" has still not done
well.  Costing, I think, around ninety million dollars, it has since
grossed about twenty-two.  Unfortunately, this film is a little too
intense for viewers, even for me, and I can stand almost anything (I
recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic "Caligula," the worst film I
have ever seen in my life, and did it in a mere 2 sittings).  Although I
respect "Beloved," I can't say that I really enjoyed it.</P>
