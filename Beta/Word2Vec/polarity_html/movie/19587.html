<P>starring Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson
screenplay by David Self, based on The Haunting of Hill House by
Shirley Jackson
directed by Jan De Bont</P>
<P>"Some houses are born bad," goes The Haunting's tag line, to which I
must add, "Some movies, too." Nothing short of hiring a new cast, a
more literate screenwriter, and a new director could have saved this
tragically misguided adaptation of Jackson's meritorious novel. The
Haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy, and its
seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound
effects don't frighten so much as numb the audience into
submission-the film is like a Rube Goldberg contraption rigged to
shout "boo."</P>
<P>Fragile Nell (Taylor), bisexual Theo (Zeta-Jones), and smiley Luke
(Wilson) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed
Hill House for an extended study on sleep disorders, hosted by
Professor  Marrow (Neeson). Marrow's secretly gathering data on their
respective paranoid responses to his recount of Hill House's bleak
history. He's not prepared for the very real apparitions that
terrorize the crew, Nell especially, who has some ancestral connection
to the manor's previous inhabitants.</P>
<P>Taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead. For
starters, her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even
the early scenes, when we're introduced to the mansion and all its
fun-house trappings. Her character is supposed to be depressed, having
tended to an unloving mother for too many years, but Taylor plays Nell
as supernaturally lame, alternately grouchy, mopey, wiggy and
pathetic, and I kept wondering why the other characters didn't just
ditch this bitch.</P>
<P>As for the obscenely photogenic Zeta-Jones, she breezes through her
scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her.
Unfortunately, she's saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue
the screenplay has to offer. Theo's assessment of the house? "I love
it! Sort of Charles Foster Kane meets The Munsters." Who on Earth
would say that in place of "Citizen Kane meets The Munsters"?
(Furthermore, would you gladly spend a single night in a house
befitting that description?)</P>
<P>Both actresses fare better than Neeson, who looks embarrassed to be a
part of this ensemble (and for good reason), and his character is the
most bland. As Luke puts it, Dr. Marrow pulls the old "academic bait
and switch" on his subjects, but he breaks down and confesses to this
the second he's accused. Later, he risks his life by climbing a
crumbling stairwell to save Nell (it's amusing to hear Neeson shout
"Nell" repeatedly, given his starring role in the 1994 Jodie Foster
vehicle of the same name). Why was this nice, helpful, and redemptive
researcher so absent of ethics at the start?</P>
<P>The Haunting was well designed by Eugenio Zanetti. His sets are
obsessively detailed, and even before the CGI kicks in, they seem
alive, never quite still. I do have one beef with this aspect of the
production: the real life mansion used in exterior shots,
Nottinghamshire's Harlaxton Manor, is so vast that one has trouble
believing that Nell and company, no matter how much running away they
do from ghosts and goblins, always finish up in locations that were
established in act one, as if all the action has been confined to one
wing of Hill House.</P>
<P>Eighty million dollars was spent on The Haunting, and despite a
powerhouse box office debut, I doubt it will recoup its costs
(including marketing) domestically. Thank Jan De Bont for that:
proving for the third time that Speed was a fluke, in that it was
actually enjoyable, De Bont has served up another ride, sans thrill.
His images, well-lit though they are, have an unmistakable been
there-done that quality; in fact, whole sequences, not to mention the
cloaked, airy ghoul who owns the climax, feel lifted from a much
smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers
back, Peter Jackson's The Frighteners. I don't mean to suggest De Bont
is a plagiarist, I mean to suggest that he's a hack, having found no
new ways to give us chills.</P>
