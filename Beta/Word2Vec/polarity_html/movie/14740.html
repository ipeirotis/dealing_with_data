<PRE><HR></PRE>
<P>Most people fit into two different categories: you either love Woody Allen, or
you hate his guts.  My family, for the most part, hates him and his movies.  I
think he's very funny, but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the
years.  So maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could
have thought of.  Unrestrained by physical boundaries, Allen's humor comes
shining through.  Those who had problems with his physical appearance will be
able to join the rest of us in laughing at Allen's intelligent observations of
life.  Those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one.</P>
<P>In 1995, a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and
showed them something they'd never seen before.  TOY STORY used state-of-the-art
computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no
humans were present.  Many critics will call that a better film, but I believe
they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture.  ANTZ,
however, has upped the ante considerably.  Disney's A BUG'S LIFE isn't due out
for another two months, and DreamWorks seems to have received the better end of
the deal.  By beating Disney out, they have satisfied the audience's thirst for
computer-animated films.  But don't let that fool you: Disney is definitely not
scared.</P>
<P>In the past two years, competitions have broken out between studios.  In 1997,
it was the volcano duel.  In my opinion, DANTE'S PEAK came out way ahead of its
predecessor, both in time and in quality.  VOLCANO had an original premise, but
destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations.  In 1998, there are twice
as many competing films.  First was the comet competition, and ARMAGEDDON blew
away it's cheesily dramatic competitor DEEP IMPACT.  But now, it's even more
interesting, as one beloved studio (Disney) goes up against the newcomer
(DreamWorks).  Who will prevail?  Time will tell, but I'm sure that Mr. Mouse
has nothing to fear.</P>
<P>This may sound like I didn't like ANTZ; on the contrary, I'd put it up there
with TOY STORY.  But due to it's PG rating, many parents may be put off by some
of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in Disney's version.  Some of the
dialogue in ANTZ pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film.  Sexual
innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally, which makes DreamWorks' animated
feature geared more for an adult crowd.  The humor is also written especially
for adults, though many kids were laughing in the theater I attended.  This is
the type of film that should be made for families more often: entertaining for
kids AND entertaining for parents.</P>
<P>ANTZ begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between Woody Allen's
shtick and Franz Kafka's METAMORPHOSIS, the short story of a man who wakes up to
discover himself as a bug.  Z (Allen) is a troubled ant, believing he was not
made to be a worker.  "When you're the middle child in a family of five
million..." he comments about his neglected childhood.  One night, Z is sitting
in a bar with his friend Weaver (Sylvester Stallone), discussing his pathetic
place in life.  In walks Princess Bala (Sharon Stone), whom no one recognizes
without a crown.  Bala asks Z is he would like to dance, and they engage in a
PULP FICTION-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader.  After
discovering that she is the princess, Z falls in love, but there's a problem:
Bala is getting married to General Mandible (Gene Hackman), a ruthless leader
who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony.  In order to do that,
he must eliminate not only the Queen (Anne Bancroft), but the weakest of the
colony, namely the worker ants.  But to get rid of the Queen, he needs to get
rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her.</P>
<P>He and Colonel Cutter (Christopher Walkin) come up with a plan to send the loyal
ants off to battle, where they will surely be killed.  The Queen is reluctant at
first, but decides it is best for the colony.  Meanwhile, Z wants to meet Bala
again, and he asks Weaver, an army ant, to switch places with him.  So Z gets
sent off to battle, but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites.
The battle sequence is absolutely stunning, though you may have flashbacks to
STARSHIP TROOPERS, which contained a very similar sequence.  However, ANTZ and
that 1997 film were both in production around the same time, so the similarities
are merely coincidence.</P>
<P>The second half of the film revolves around Z's kidnapping of Bala, and their
search for a mythical place called Insectopia.  There, an ant can be his own
boss and have all the food he wants.  The adventures Z and Bala get into are
surprisingly high in tension, especially one involving a magnifying glass.
Looming over the targets like the spaceships from INDEPENDENCE DAY (in fact, I'm
just going to assume that the producers referenced ID4 intentionally).  The ants
look up in awe, and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground.  Visually, it's
an exciting rush of adrenaline.  But don't be fooled... little kids shouldn't
see this, as they may just try and copy it.  After seeing ANTZ, I vowed never to
intentionally step on an ant again.  Hopefully, children will learn that killing
ants is rather cruel.</P>
<P>As an animated film, ANTZ is probably the best you will find to date.  Visually,
it's as stunning as WHAT DREAMS MAY COME.  The best aspect of animation is the
fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity.  They can take ridiculous
situations and make them seem plausible.  One great moment involves a mass of
worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball.  The animation is so perfect
that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball.  However, the most
exhilarating scene involves Bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy's
shoe.  It's truly a great example of film making at its finest.  With computer
technology, the animators have carefully made the ants' faces look similar to
the actors providing the voices.  The best example would have to be Barbatus
(Danny Glover).  At one point, you can even see the pores on his face (although,
I doubt ants have pores... do they?).  Barbatus also has a touching but rather
gruesome scene as he has his final words with Z without a body.  Young kids may
be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head, but a good deal of humor is
derived (more appropriate for adults, of course).  Disney's A BUG'S LIFE looks
good, but I don't know if they will be able to best DreamWorks' newest animated
feature in terms of animation.  If not, then DreamWorks will have done something
no other studio could do: go head to head with the big Mouse, and knock him down
(yes, Anastasia was good, but not nearly as good as even the worst of Disney).</P>
<P>Vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature, and ANTZ has one of the
best line-ups seen since TOY STORY.  In fact, it far exceeds that one.  Woody
Allen has always been funny, but here he transcends most of what he's done in
the past few years.  Without a body, his comic timing is the most noticeable
thing.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his
lines.  Sharon Stone as Bala shows off some of her comic ability, though for the
most part, Stone works best as a dramatic actress.  Sylvester Stallone (teamed
up with Stone once again) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants
to be an actor, not a typecast action star.  After a snub at the Oscars last
year, Stallone is proving himself as the serious (or comedic, as illustrated
here) actor that he is.  Gene Hackman is superb as the gruff-talking General,
almost doing another take on his CRIMSON TIDE persona.  Christopher Walkin is
probably more noticed by his voice, and so many people will remember him from
such hits as BATMAN RETURNS.  Anne Bancroft has a minimal role, but she's
effective nonetheless.  Danny Glover has a small role, but he does a very, very
good job.  Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick,
Euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable, especially Aykroyd.  Jennifer
Lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with Weaver, although most people
won't recognize her voice either.  Many people will recognize Grant Shaud's
voice as the foreman.  He played Miles on the TV show MURPHY BROWN.  This is
definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names, and it will definitely help
it's grosses.  Of course, you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million
budget went to, also.</P>
<P>Directors Eric Darnell and Lawrence Guterman are relative newcomers (though
Guterman did direct a 1994 feature, HEADLESS!).  But both show an incredible
talent for this type of a picture.  Tense at times, and very funny throughout,
the two hold this film together like professionals.  The screenplay by Todd
Alcott and Chris Weitz is quite simple in plot, but it contains a lot of
subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults.  Kids will delight in the
animation, while parents can laugh heartily at the humor.  Most of it will go
over young children's heads.  Does that mean you shouldn't take kids to see it?
Not at all.  They will have a lot of fun watching this one.  What is great is
the themes that are given to us.  Part social commentary, part romance story,
and part moral drama, ANTZ gives everyone something to talk about, whether it be
the animation, or the discussions of individualism and community.  Thankfully,
it's not subtle in either aspects.</P>
<P>ANTZ is rated PG for mild language and some intense action.  Sometimes the
language can be pushing the limits for a family movie, but the violence is what
should keep kids at home.  The battle scene has ants melting in acid, and bugs
being speared to death.  And the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in
the beam of sunlight.  But other than that (and some sexual innuendos), it's a
perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters.  I doubt many children
will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough, but it's still
advisable to leave really young children at home.  Have I confused you enough?
If you do take your kids, I recommend seeing the film with them, because more
than likely, you'll enjoy it the most.</P>
