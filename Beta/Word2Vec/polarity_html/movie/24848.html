<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Inspired by the 1994 novel by William Trevor, this is a film about a
serial killer that promised to be more inspiring than it turned out,
even though it is an excellently crafted film and has more to offer than
the usual serial killer film does. It studied a warped man from when he
was seen as a child smothered by his mother's overbearing presence, as
she was more interested in her career than she was in him, and then the
film shows him as he is now, a respected member of his community but a
very lonely man. It, somehow, takes a familiar journey down this
director's path even if it seems the director is drifting off into
foreign territory. The innovative Canadian of Armenian descent, Atom
Egoyan, who has in the past covered such familiar themes as he does
here, revisits the themes of betrayal, familial ills, religious
conflicts, sexual secrets, videotapes, and uncertain identities.</P>
<P>The film loses its intensity somewhere along the time a naive,
unfortunate young Irish girl leaves her home in lush County Cork to come
to industrial Birmingham, England, in search of her boyfriend who is
seeking work there. Her main reason for coming is to tell the one she
loves, that he made her pregnant and she wants the baby. When there, she
will meet a seemingly altruistic stranger who it turns out is a serial
killer.</P>
<P>Felicia (Cassidy) is desperate and alienated, after hearing from her
embittered Irish nationalist widowed father rant on that her boyfriend
Johnny is a traitor to Ireland, that he lied to her by not telling her
he joined the British army, and that she is carrying in her a child who
is the enemy of Ireland. She foolishly believes that her Johnny is
working in the industrial Midland's of England, in a lawnmower factory.
She gets some money to make the journey there in search of him from her
dying great-grandmother, after receiving no letters from him and of
being rebuffed by Johnny's mother, as she throws the letters Felicia
gives her to send to Johnny in the fire, after reading them and
sneering.</P>
<P>The bedraggled Felicia can't find Johnny in the polluted city of
Birmingham, but Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Hoskins), on a shopping spree,
meets her when she asks for directions and he chats her up, and the next
day, he gives her a lift to a place where he says a lot of Irish lads
work. He is a lonely gourmet catering manager in a factory, who forms
this odd relationship with this young girl based on his need to talk
with someone outside of work.</P>
<P>While she looks for Johnny in the factory, he goes through her backpack
and steals her money. When he is driving Felicia, there are flashbacks
of other girls he befriended and rode in the same car with and with whom
he recorded their conversations, which we disturbingly hear, and even
though it is not shown what eventually happened to them, it is eerily
certain that Hilditch acts to befriend these helpless prostitutes or
runaway girls, secretly videotaping them, to then kill them when they
don't need him anymore and try to leave.</P>
<P>The film is adept at using flashbacks from both Felicia's and Hilditch's
dysfunctional childhoods, to show how innocent and angelic she is, and
how troubled and confused he is, and how she comes from a poor
background raised without a mother and he from a wealthy family raised
by a mother who used him to promote her cooking show. Hilditch lives
alone in the large clapboard house he inherited from his mother, and
surrounds himself with 1950s memorabilia, including Mix Masters, and
listens to syrupy Mantovani music and artless ballads like "My Special
Angel," which are on LP's. He watches videos in his kitchen while he is
cooking the same food he sees on the videotapes. The videos are of his
sophisticated French mother Gala, who was a famous TV host of a cooking
show in the 1950s, and the videos also show him performing with her,
appearing as a fat and awkward child. He is now a stout, balding man, in
his fifties, who is friendly and respected at his workplace as a man
with impeccable culinary taste.</P>
<P>After leaving Hilditch, Felicia is approached by a Jamaican Christian
missionary (Claire Benedict), who has big shiny teeth like a wolf. She
talks her into staying at their organization's shelter. Felicia notices
her money is missing while there, and the missionary people react
negatively to her saying that they might have stolen her money. She is
then forced back into the house of Hilditch, and we see how the two
troubled souls relate to each other in a heartbreaking way.</P>
<P>The crux of the film centers around her reactions from the stern
rejection from her father and Johnny's mother, and of being ignored by
Johnny. The missionary who is in the business of saving souls, is shown
to be full of words that are robotically recited, because when she has a
chance to save the helpless Felicia, she doesn't even try. Curiously,
the only warmth and help Felicia receives, is from Hilditch, and he is
the one who wants to kill her.</P>
<P>Elaine Cassidy captures the character's youthful naivity and quiet
determination to get on with her life despite the upheavals in it, as
she is seen as too inexperienced and vulnerable for all the evil there
is she has to face in the place she was born in and the foreign place
she traveled to. She has come to England as an innocent, but after her
abortion, she is no longer completely innocent, though she still remains
ignorant of her situation.</P>
<P>Bob Hoskins performance is brilliantly mannered, even if he chews the
scenery to gain such control, but, nevertheless, he is engaging as a
manipulative predator and someone who could be both charming and
frightening. His performance has the proper mixture of terror for what
he has become and sympathy for what he hasn't become.</P>
<P>What fails this otherwise competent and worthwhile production, is that
everything falls too easily into psychological place by the film's end.
We are led to believe we understand too much about this serial killer
and that he can be redeemed, but the reality is, that we understand too
little about him, despite the appropriate effort that is made to
understand him. When the nature of the relationship Hoskins has in mind
with Felicia becomes obvious, the film can't recover from this knowledge
and it becomes more natural for the audience to care that the angelic
Cassidy somehow survives what is intended her, rather than the film
going into deeper and more unfamiliar ground. This serial killer film
falls below the achievements of M and Peeping Tom, as it falls into the
range of films that miss their mark but are still enriching.</P>
