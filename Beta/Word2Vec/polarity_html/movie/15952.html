<PRE>LOVE IS THE DEVIL (1998)
A Film Reivew by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Writer/Director: John Maybury
Starring: Derek Jacobi, Daniel Craig, Anne Lambton, Tilda Swinton,
Adrian Scarborough, Karl Johnson, Annabel Brooks, Richard Newbould</P>
<P>"Love is the Devil" is a challenging film, munundating its audience with
wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot, perhaps in an
attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's
lifeline.  Watching it, I was enthralled with the look of the film, the
way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre,
personalized filter.  Everything looks like it is not how life looks
like but how painter Francis Bacon, the film's subject, looked at it
personally.</P>
<P>But while I was engrossed, I stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through
the film, awakened from my trance by some inner distraction, and began
to try and follow what's going on.  Exactly what was I looking at?
Watching this film, I wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film I
had ever seen or the most vacuous.  Directed (and written) by John
Maybury, "Love is the Devil" is stylish masterpiece for the senses.
Everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing.  The camera angles
are ferociously askew, and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close.
The editing is deft, occasionally cutting away to something bizarre
every couple seconds, but other times holding on a shot for so long that
you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs, or rather,
intruders to Bacon's world and psyche.</P>
<P>As such, there is no real story.  I've not heard much about Francis
Bacon that I didn't read prior to the film, but what I learned was this:
he was a painter in England who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s,
drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like.  He was one
of the first to really come out of the closet, and in interviews, he was
notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty.  As played by great Shakesperean
actor Derek Jacobi, he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between
Oscar Wilde and Nero.  He lives life the way he wants to live it, to the
disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to
him.  It's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and
maybe himself ("Champagne for my real friends, and pain for my sham
friends," he says one night at the bar he frequents).</P>
<P>"Love is the Devil" chronicles the latter part of his life.  Bacon,
well-known in his mid-life, awakens one night when he hears a man tumble
through his ceiling window and land on the floor.  He walks in, unafraid
of what he finds, and discovers a thief, George Dyer (Daniel Craig).
Bacon gives him an offer: if he spends the night with him, he can take
anything he wants in the morning.  George agrees to this, and off to bed
he goes, but ends up staying with him, for whatever reason.  The film
shows their lives together, at least in reference to one another.</P>
<P>While creating Bacon's world of friends (like "High Art," this film
minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection
that is not shown but is understood), the film shows the relationship of
Bacon and George as it remains rather stagnant.  Bacon is haughty and
bizarre; George is simple and doesn't understand Bacon in the least,
especially not his paintings.  While watching this, that's basically all
I thought was there.  The film has a hypnotic feel, free of any
restraints of form, and is shot so uniquely that I felt my attention was
almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is
about.</P>
<P>Once the film is over, it's easier to piece it together.  I kept on
thinking about this film, wondering what the point to all of it was.
Someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all,
and if they do, they do it by accident, but still allow some substance
to creep in.  Thinking about it, I remembered how the two fed off of
eachother.  I thought about how Bacon was a masochist, in love with
cruelty (in one scene, he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic
delight, and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one
boxer's head splashes across his face; in another scene, he masturbates
to the Odessa Steps sequence of Eisenstein's "Battleship Potemkin"), and
perhaps he drove George too far in his delight for pain.  He drove him
over the edge, and for him that was love, even if it wasn't for George.
I guess that explains the title.  A bit.</P>
<P>That's great and all, but I almost wish the film was devoid of any
meaning.  I wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about
humanity, about how love is the most selfish thing in the world (and it
is, if you look at it a certain way).  Or maybe if it had avoided any
meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film
that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche.  It's almost always best
to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is
forcing universality down an audience's throat.  That way you don't
reduce your film to something it's just not.</P>
<P>I can't say I totally enjoyed "Love is the Devil," though.  Despite all
of the things I respect about this movie, it's still rather
uncomfortable to sit through.  Even at a normally trite length of ninety
minutes, the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through,
especially after an exhausting first hour.  Though hypnotic, it still
almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times, as if it were taking
advantage of one man's truly bizarre nature but not doing anything
deeper with it.  As such, I respect the way the film looks.  It's
beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that, along with "What Dreams May
Come" and "Dark City," it's the year's most visually stunning film.  In
fact, if a better script had been forged, I'd almost compare it in
visual power to a Peter Greenaway film, complete with similar haunting
images that stick in the mind forever.  And with a dymanite performance
by Derek Jacobi, it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs.  I
just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of
substance.  Then I would have had something to hold me over even now.</P>
