<P>     It is one of the more cumbersome pieces of baggage which goes along
with being a film critic that, every once in a while, a film comes along
which you are _supposed_ to like on general principle.  Critics are
sometimes placed in the uncomfortable position of being expected to
champion small, ennobling films simply because, like cinematic castor oil,
they are good for us.  ONCE UPON A TIME...WHEN WE WERE COLORED is a film
which wears its earnestness proudly on its sleeve; it means well, and it
tries hard.  But a film has to have something more going for it than
principle, and ONCE UPON A TIME... is a well-acted but extremely
fragmented story which can't quite get its tone down straight.</P>
<P>     Based on the autobiographical writings of Clifton Taulbert, ONCE UPON
A TIME...WHEN WE WERE COLORED opens in Glen Allan, Mississippi in 1946,
with the birth of Cliff to an unmarried farm girl named Mary (Karen Malina
White).  When his mother eventually becomes a teacher in a nearby town,
Cliff is raised primarily by his great-grandfather Poppa (Al Freeman Jr.)
and great-grandmother Mama Pearl (Paula Kelly).  Under Poppa's care Cliff
gradually begins to understand the facts of life in the segregated South.
Mama Pearl's growing infirmity forces Cliff to live with yet another
caregiver, his aunt known as Ma Ponk (Phylicia Rashad).  Cliff observes as
prejudice affects several friends including an iceman named Cleve (Richard
Roundtree), and how the allure of the more integrated North draws away
many members of his family.</P>
<P>     ONCE UPON A TIME...WHEN WE WERE COLORED is not particularly
interested in detailing the day-to-day ugliness of life in the segregated
South; it is a film about a kind of community which no longer exists, and
as such it is occasionally quite touching.  It is difficult not to watch
scenes of 4th of July barbecues for which the whole town turns out, or to
notice how the people of Glen Allan look out for each other, without
feeling a sense of sadness that that unity had to disappear with the
passing years.  This is more of a love letter to a time when Southern
blacks realized that all they had was each other, and treated their
community with reverence and respect, than it is a remembrance of
cruelties past.</P>
<P>     The main problem with ONCE UPON A TIME is that it makes frequent side
trips to episodic stories which don't resonate, despite insistent
voice-over narration (provided by screenwriter Paul W. Cooper) that tries
to convince us that they should.  There is a sub-plot involving the return
of Ma Ponk's son Melvin (Leon) to visit from his new home in Detroit, and
his attempt to convince an old girlfriend to come with him.  The story
allows for a scene in a backwater juke joint which adds a bit of
atmosphere, but the relationship doesn't really matter, because there's a
history there we haven't had a chance to see.  The same is true of an
episode involving a traveling chorus girl (Iona Morris) who stays with
Cliff and Ma Ponk, and the result of Ma Ponk's visit to see the show, or
Cliff's relationship with a kindly white woman (Polly Bergen) who gets
library books for him to read.  There is an incompleteness to many of the
individual episodes, and a lack of emotion to scenes which seem designed
to provoke an emotional response.</P>
<P>     When ONCE UPON A TIME...WHEN WE WERE COLORED spends time with Cliff
and his family, there is a lot to recommend it.  Al Freeman Jr. gives a
subtle but commanding performance as the proud Poppa, who has the
unpleasant task of teaching his great-grandson why there are certain
restrooms he cannot use; a scene in which he reacts to Cliff proudly using
the correct, "colored" drinking fountain is a fine piece of non-verbal
acting.  Too often, however, the film drifts away from Cliff's
point-of-view, or injects an obligatory bit of racial violence almost
because it seems to be expected.  First-time feature director Tim Reid
maintains a steady pace and evokes the atmosphere of his setting
skillfully, but he doesn't find a narrative in the many stories he is
trying to put on the screen.  If its story and its characters had been as
consistent as its good intentions, it might have been a great film.</P>
