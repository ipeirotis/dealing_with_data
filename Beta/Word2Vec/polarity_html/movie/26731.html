<PRE>BLAIR WITCH 2: BOOK OF SHADOWS
Review by Jan Bednarczuk
Rating: F</PRE>
<P>I went to Blair Witch Project 2: Book of Shadows with the highest 
of hopes.  The original film, released last summer, was genuinely 
scary and terrifying; I hoped that this movie would live up to 
its predecessor.  Unfortunately, my hopes were soon dashed.</P>
<P>As the movie opens, the audience is shown pseudo-documentary 
clips of Burkittsville, Maryland residents being interviewed 
about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the 
original Blair Witch Project movie.  It's a mostly humorous, 
self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the 
first film.  During this segment, we are introduced to the 
protagonist, a young man who sells Blair Witch-related 
memorabilia from his website.</P>
<P>The movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are 
about to see occurred one year previously.  We see the same young 
man that was selling Blair Witch paraphernalia, but now he is 
confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds 
in bad horror movies. We see him having some sort of disgusting 
white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a 
cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him.  We see him 
throwing himself wildly around a padded room; we see him cowering 
naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him.  No 
explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution; 
in fact, these scenes are barely referred to again.  I had a 
sinking feeling during these opening scenes; generally, a 
hospital scene that is set with poor lighting, filthy interiors, 
and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a 
truly horrible movie.</P>
<P>The movie cuts again, this time to the present.  The young man, 
whose name is Jeffrey (played by Jeffrey Donovan -- as in the 
first movie, the character names are identical to the actors' 
names, although this movie admits up front that it is 
fictional, so there's no reason for the practice this time 
around), is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading 
into the woods that weekend for the "Blair Witch Hunt," which is 
a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website.</P>
<P>We meet Tristen and Steven, a young couple who are writing a book 
about the Blair Witch experience.  Steven is a skeptic, believing 
the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria.  Tristen, on 
the other hand, believes that there may be some truth to the 
rumors of supernatural occurrence.  She is wan and soft-spoken; 
she complains that the radio is playing too loudly.  (She also 
complains that she feels nauseated; I knew immediately that the 
character was pregnant, and my intuition was confirmed a few 
scenes later when Kim psychomagically susses it out.  How did I 
know?  Because in bad movies, nauseated women are always 
pregnant.) The fourth member of their party is Erica, a Wiccan 
with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the Blair 
Witch was a good witch, not evil.  They pick up the fifth and 
final team member in a cemetery.  Kim is dressed completely in 
black, has extreme Goth-style makeup on, and occasionally 
displays seemingly psychic abilities, but otherwise seems to be 
the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire 
bunch.  Presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery 
just for dramatic effect; it's never explained.</P>
<P>The party of five heads off into the woods as promised.  They 
reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of Rustin Parr's 
house and set up camp, complete with extensive video equipment 
with which to record the night's events.  There is a brief 
encounter with a rival Blair Witch tour group who had planned to 
camp at that site as well, but after a few words are exchanged, 
the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere.  The movie 
veers off at this point to spend many long, long minutes showing 
the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down.  Sexual 
innuendoes are tossed around, much hard liquor, beer, and pot is 
consumed, and nothing much else happens.  This would be a great 
point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary.</P>
<P>The next day, the team wakes up and discovers that their camera 
equipment has been completely trashed, and that Steven and 
Tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in 
shreds, like snow.  The videotapes are missing, but thanks to a 
psychic intuition from Kim, they discover the videotapes buried 
underneath the foundation of the house, "right where the original 
Blair Witch tapes were found!"  Ooh.  Spooky.</P>
<P>The team goes back to Jeffrey's house  -- a creepy old Civil 
War-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and 
review the tapes.  They soon discover that the tapes mysteriously 
skip five hours of the night.  Wacky hijinks ensue.  Tristen 
starts having weird dreams in which she is the Blair Witch, 
everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on 
their bodies, Steven and Erica have some highly disturbing mutual 
hallucinations, and everything pretty much goes to hell in a 
handbasket.  Throughout the entire ordeal, Jeffrey and the others 
continue to scrutinize the videotapes, which seem to have some 
kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time 
jumps; eventually Tristen wanders in, mutters something about 
"reverse," and from this they somehow realize that they have to 
play the tapes backwards.  When they do this, they discover what 
really happened during the five lost hours.  (One of the things 
they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the 
videotapes.  Okay, if the videotapes were being buried, then how 
were they recording themselves...oh, nevermind.)</P>
<P>This movie was awful.  Simply awful.  The characters are 
broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or 
development.  Erica is the Nature-Loving Wiccan.  Tristen is the 
Weak and Sympathetic Woman.  Steven is the Overbearing Asshole.  
Kim is the Antisocial Goth Girl.  Old, tired cliches were used to 
illustrate these caricatures.  How do we know Tristen is weak and 
sympathetic?  Because she's pregnant!  How do we know Kim is an 
antisocial Goth girl?  Because she wears a lot of eye makeup!  
How do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy?  Because he has 
jagged teeth and talks like he's straight out of "Deliverance"!  
This is weak storytelling at its worst.  Rather than taking the 
time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic, 
the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical 
characteristics, in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand 
and thereby skip straight to the action.  It didn't work.  On top 
of being poorly developed, most of the characters were either 
seriously unlikable or patently stupid.  ("Honey, you just had a 
miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a 
hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie.  
Let's get on a plane home."  "No.  I am having these bizarre 
nightmares and seeing strange visions and I want to find out 
what's going on."  "OK.")  Frankly, by the end of the movie, I 
was rooting for the Witch.</P>
<P>I also felt that there was simply too much blood 'n' gore in this 
film.  The first movie worked by never showing us the horror.  
The Witch was a palpable presence in that movie, but we never saw 
it; we never saw anything, in fact.  The horror was all 
off-screen, and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision 
what it might possibly be.  This is the hallmark of a truly 
creepy and disturbing horror movie.  Blair Witch 2 dispensed with 
such niceties and went straight for the gross-out.  This was 
evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white 
goo down Jeffrey's throat, and continued throughout the film as 
the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting 
footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort.  
Knives plunge into flesh, bloody fingers trail off into the 
darkness, and none of it is explained until the very end, when it 
was too late for me to care.</P>
<P>This movie didn't stop with showing us the gore, either; it went 
for broke and showed us everything. By the end of the movie, 
there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours.  
It is all explained; in fact, it is all shown on-screen in loving 
detail.  I confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in 
which you never see the monster, or see only brief glimpses, mere 
suggestions of what the monster is; it is not because I find the 
monster so terrifying, but because I find the absence of the 
monster to be infinitely more terrifying.   </P>
<P>I have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested 
that there is no "monster," that all of the evil was perpetrated 
only by the human mind.  I found this to be a miserably poor 
explanation; if it was in fact the director's intent, then he 
needs to have some words with the writer, because it was not made 
clear at all.  (I know a lot of people who like to go to parties 
and get drunk and stoned out of their minds; none of them has 
ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass 
hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or 
so.  And if there was no Witch, then what about the vanishing 
tree?  The snowfall of manuscript paper?  Hm?) </P>
<P>Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows was a horrible movie.  From the 
poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot 
inconsistencies to the gross-out shots, it was a bad effort 
through and through.</P>
