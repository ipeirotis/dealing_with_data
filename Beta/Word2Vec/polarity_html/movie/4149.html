<P>     Frankly, I'm not entirely sure at what audience THREE WISHES is
aimed.  With its wholesome, politically-correct story, it seems focused
at the under-15 crowd.  Yet, considering the slow pace and relative
dearth of action, adults might be the only ones with the patience to sit
through these two hours.  The result is a film that doesn't have a
strong appeal for any age group.  Some viewers will undoubtedly be
charmed by this mystical, whimsical motion picture, but it's doubtful
there will be enough fans to save it from a quick box office death.</P>
<P>     In recent years, Patrick Swayze has been attempting to broaden his
image, branching away from the hunky, action-oriented roles he
gravitated towards in his early Hollywood days.  (Has it really been
that long since DIRTY DANCING?)  After starting down this less-traveled
road in 1992 with CITY OF JOY, Swayze has continued along the path with
the likes of TOO WONG FOO and now THREE WISHES.  Here, he plays a
drifter without a penny to his name, and there's not a fist fight to be
found.  Hardly a traditional heroic image.</P>
<P>     As the soundtrack, which includes such tunes as "Do You Believe in
Magic?" and "Earth Angel", indicates, THREE WISHES is about dreams and
magic.  Its message, which is all-but-shouted from the rooftops
(subtlety is not the film's strong suit), is that we should all stop
yearning for what we can't have and "find happiness in whatever [we've]
got."  Just because there's a piece missing from the puzzle of the
American Dream doesn't mean that life can't be wonderful.  This is a
very traditional theme, and one that's probably a little too obvious for
a sophisticated movie-going audience.</P>
<P>     Of course, for those not impressed by the message, there's a heavy
element of nostalgia to inhale.  Set in 1955, THREE WISHES is full of
pastel reminders of $13,500 dream houses, old TV shows like OZZIE AND
HARRIET, and two-parent families where the mother tends home and the
father provides.  The story opens on Memorial Day at a cemetery for
veterans of the Korean War, where Jeanne (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio)
and her two sons, Tom (Joseph Mazzello) and Gunther (Seth Mumy), have
come to remember their father, whose plane was shot down several years
ago.  On the way home, an accident occurs which changes the direction of
the fatherless family's life.  A dog runs in front of Jeanne's car and,
when she swerves to avoid running it over, she instead hits a man--a
vagrant named Jack (Patrick Swayze) who is just passing through town.
Feeling guilty about what has happened, Jeanne invites Jack to spend
time at her house until his broken leg has healed.  As it turns out,
however, the man and his dog are more than they seem.</P>
<P>     As relatively pleasant and undemanding as this film is, it runs a
little too long, primarily because the setup takes the first half of the
movie.  THREE WISHES appears to have undergone some fairly heavy editing
to get it below the two hour mark, however, since several minor subplots
are left dangling.  The film opens and closes with brief contemporary
(1995) scenes that might have better underscored the primary theme had
they been given a greater portion of the running time.</P>
<P>     Character development is also on the weak side.  While the primary
four (Jack, Jeanne, Tom, and Gunther) are likable, none of them
possesses amazing depth.  Basically, they're just well-acted stereotypes
with a few interesting lines of dialogue.  The supporting characters
fare far worse--there isn't an interesting one in the whole lot.  From
uptight parents to bullying kids, everyone is lifted directly from
stock, with little attempt made at fleshing them out.</P>
<P>     Darker than Capra, yet somewhat reminiscent of (albeit inferior to)
classics like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, THREE WISHES has a good heart,
effective direction by Martha Coolidge (RAMBLING ROSE), and solid acting
-- yet the occasional meandering of the script doesn't allow the movie
to be as engaging or enchanting as it ought to be.  THREE WISHES is all
about the supernatural, and, considering the nearly impossible-to-market
nature of the subject matter, it's going to take a major miracle for
more than a handful of people to see this film in theaters before its
quick transfer to video.</P>
