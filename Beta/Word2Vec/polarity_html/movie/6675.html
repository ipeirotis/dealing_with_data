<P>     Albert Brooks is a rather odd case as a film-maker.  On the one hand,
he goes years between projects, has loyal and generally intelligent fans
and never has had a really big commercial success.  On the other hand, his
concepts have "pitch-meeting" written all over them.  REAL LIFE was a
parody of verite' documentaries like "An American Family;" LOST IN AMERICA
had yuppies going back to their free-wheeling roots; DEFENDING YOUR LIFE
turned heaven into "The People's Court."  Brooks is like a hybrid of Woody
Allen and Ivan Reitman, a writer/director too smart and eccentric to get
maximum mileage out of his marketing-friendly plots.  MOTHER is a perfect
example of Brooks' nose for high-concept, but for once he doesn't work any
particular magic with it.  Riding on the familiarity of his situations and
a wicked performance by Debbie Reynolds, Brooks turns out an amusing but
uneven domestic comedy.</P>
<P>     Brooks stars as John Henderson, a Los Angeles-based science-fiction
novelist going through his second divorce.  John determines that all of
his failed relationships have had certain elements in common, and that
those elements might be traceable to his upbringing.  In an attempt to
understand what goes wrong in his dealings with women, John heads up to
Northern California to move back in with the first woman in his life:  his
mother, Beatrice (Debbie Reynolds).  John's "experiment" perplexes both
Beatrice and John's successful brother Jeff (Rob Morrow), but John
perseveres anyway, and begins to examine his interactions with Beatrice in
the hope of learning some profound truths before she drives him crazy.</P>
<P>     Much of the appeal of MOTHER -- most of the appeal, to be frank --
comes from the character of Beatrice Henderson, less as created by Brooks
than as realized by Reynolds.  Mother is a sly creature given to subtle
disapproval and passive aggression, and there are moments of grand
humiliation which will inspire winces of recognition.  One running gag has
Mother constantly explaining John's marital woes to complete strangers;
another finds her making off-hand digs at John's vegetarianism.  There are
moments when Brooks verges on condescension towards his older female
characters -- an encounter with neighbors in a grocery store is both funny
and rather embarrassing -- but Debbie Reynolds salvages every one by
giving her line readings an intelligent twist.  Even when Beatrice is
fumbling with technology or circling a parking lot past the one available
space, she never comes off as dim or pathetic.  With a professionalism
showing no signs of rust after a long layoff from screen acting, Reynolds
wrestles a laundry list of motherly quirks into a wonderful character.</P>
<P>     This achievement comes almost in spite of Brooks' script, which has
plenty of funny lines but too little narrative direction.  The goodwill
generated by the main premise carries MOTHER a surprisingly long way, but
Brooks doesn't do all that much with it.  The film is full of situations
with great comic potential, most of which inspire a chuckle and little
more because Brooks prefers wry observation to outrageousness.  One such
opportunity involves John and Beatrice in a Victoria's Secret store after
Beatrice has succeeded yet again in embarrassing John.  It is a scene
which primes you for a huge laugh -- a man, his mother, lingerie...can you
feel the giddy tension rising? -- then dissolves after yet another
good-natured chuckle.  MOTHER is full of moments, like a scene where John
channel-surfs through a succession of info-mercials, where Brooks seems to
be waiting for a punch line to formulate itself instead of attacking the
set-up to provide a payoff.</P>
<P>     MOTHER is almost always an entertaining film, but it is not nearly as
subversive as it could have been, or as FLIRTING WITH DISASTER was
covering similar ground of warped familial relations.  Perhaps the problem
is that the script does not launch itself from full, rich
characterizations.  In fact, as the story unfolds, it seems that Brooks
has constructed his story around psychological case studies rather than
people.  Every time Mother does something exasperating, John deconstructs
it in search of its deeper significance.  The result is frustrating, as
though Brooks were telling jokes then stopping after each one to explain
why it was just as sad as it was funny.  It is one of the characteristics
which makes Brooks unique as a film-maker that he builds his climax around
a moment of insight rather than a wacky car chase, but there has to be a
middle ground.  Debbie Reynolds takes MOTHER's high-concept and gives it
high energy, making it a film anyone who has had a mother could like, but
perhaps only a mother could love.</P>
