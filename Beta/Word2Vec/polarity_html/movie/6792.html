<P>     During the course of his short, stormy life, Depression era writer 
Robert E. Howard created more than two dozen pulp heroes, and wrote 
hundreds of short stories.  His best-known creation, Conan the 
Barbarian, became so popular during the 1970s and '80s that he spawned 
comic books, more than fifty original novels (far outstripping Howard's 
original output), and two motion pictures (CONAN THE BARBARIAN and CONAN 
THE DESTROYER, both starring Arnold Schwarzenegger).  It's said that the 
best way to know an author is to read his writing, and, as Dan Ireland's 
THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD shows, Howard was a man who gave his all to his 
work. </P>
<P>     During Conan's resurgence in the 1970s, a lot of things -- many of 
them profoundly uncomplimentary -- were written and said about the 
author, who had died some forty years earlier from a self-inflicted 
gunshot wound.  Novalyne Price Ellis, a woman who had enjoyed a special 
relationship with Howard, decided to set the record straight by 
revealing "the real Bob Howard."  The result was ONE WHO WALKED ALONE, 
which was published in 1985.  This memoir became the basis of THE WHOLE 
WIDE WORLD, which presents a portrait of Howard as seen through the eyes 
of a woman who loved him, but would never in return be loved in the same 
way. </P>
<P>     The film opens during 1933 in Brownwood, Texas, with the meeting of 
Novalyne (Renee Zellweger), a would-be author, and Robert (Vincent 
D'Onofrio), "the best pulp writer in the whole wide world."  The two hit 
it off almost immediately, despite the difference in their life-views.  
Over the course of the next three years, their relationship ebbs and 
flows, with Novalyne falling for Robert in a way that is never 
reciprocated.  It's clear that he cares for her, but he is emotionally 
unable to commit to a relationship.  In his own words:  "The road I 
walk, I walk alone."   </P>
<P>     Although THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD is primarily a study of the 
characters and their romantic liaison, Michael Scott Myers' script finds 
time to explore other fascinating issues, including the philosophy of 
writing and the power of imagination.  Robert and Novalyne spend hours 
on end debating their craft and the dubious virtues of the Conan 
stories.  He explains to her that "excitement's my specialty... 
excitement and adventure."  When she relates the plot of one of her 
recent stories, he breaks out laughing.   </P>
<P>     THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD contains some wonderfully tender moments, 
including one where Robert and Novalyne hold hands with a glorious, 
golden sunset in the background.  There are also some startling 
sequences that evoke the state of Robert's mind.  In one scene, the 
camera zooms in on his eyes as he speaks passionately about who Conan 
is.  As his speech becomes more animated, we can hear the distant clang 
of clashing swords.  Ireland uses such innovative audio tricks to open 
the window to Robert's mental state a little wider.  And, while we never 
fully comprehend the complex workings of the author's mind, we 
understand that his extreme devotion to his mother (Ann Wedgeworth) lies 
at the core of his inability to resolve his feelings for Novalyne. </P>
<P>     This film would not be as stirring, nor would the love story be as 
poignant, if not for the dynamic portrayals of the two main actors.  
Vincent D'Onofrio is commanding as Robert, presenting him as a "morose, 
ungainly misfit among men" whose shy, gentle nature is occasionally 
ripped apart by brief, psychotic episodes.  Renee Zellweger, who has 
become a hot prospect after her eye-opening turn in JERRY MAGUIRE, here 
proves that the talent displayed opposite Tom Cruise was no fluke.  
Novalyne, not unlike MAGUIRE's Dorothy, is a strong, independent woman -
- a spitfire with a vulnerable side.  And, considering the strength of 
her performance, you'd never guess that the role was developed with 
Olivia D'Abo in mind.  (D'Abo was five months pregnant when THE WHOLE 
WIDE WORLD went into production, and, as a result, was unable to 
appear.) </P>
<P>     There's nothing earthshaking about THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD, a film 
that is, by the director's own admission, very small.  Nevertheless, it 
successfully accomplishes what it sets out to do, and the result is 
affecting and involving.  So, while it may be true that the best way to 
get into the mind of Robert E. Howard is to read his stories, seeing THE 
WHOLE WIDE WORLD will give you an appreciation of a side of him that was 
never revealed in any Conan yarn. </P>
