<P>     You can't quite prepare for the possibility that your enjoyment of a
film will hinge on subtitles. Those translating captions are truly a mixed
blessing for the worldly cineaste. On the one hand, they're infinitely
preferable to wretched dubbing that sucks the life out of performances. On
the other hand, they can be undercut by techical ineptitude (fuzzy white
text that gets lost in white backgrounds) or linguistic laziness (opting
to translate only about every fourth word). Then there are the oddest
cases, where English is translated back into English due to concern over
the intelligibility of thick accents: TRAINSPOTTING, MY NAME IS JOE and
the 1997 Scottish comedy-drama ORPHANS, just now making its way to
American screens.</P>
<P>     There's some pretty interesting stuff going on in ORPHANS. I only
wish the subtitling hadn't distracted me virtually every minute of the
film. The bulk of the story takes place in the 24 hours before the funeral
of a Glasgow mother of four. Over the course of one long night and
morning, the four siblings deal with radically different responses to
their mother's death. Eldest son Thomas (Gary Lewis) keeps a vigilant,
self-sacrificing watch over the casket at the church after an emotional
performance at a karaoke bar. Michael (Douglas Henshall) copes with a
knife wound sustained in a fight with a man who mocked Thomas' teary song.
John (Stephen McCole) sets out with his pal Tanga (Frank Gallagher) to
kill the man who injured Michael. And Sheila (Rosemarie Stevenson) --
wheelchair-bound with an unspecified condition, perhaps cerebral palsy --
simply wants to avoid the funeral altogether.</P>
<P>     The siblings' adventures are entirely episodic, and therefore -- not
surprisingly -- of widely varying quality. Most compelling are the
misadventures of John and Tanga, including their stop to torment a
customer who stiffed Chinese food deliveryman Tanga on a tip and a
startling moment after John finally confronts the man he's sworn to kill.
Michael's quiet encounter with his ex-wife is also a winner, leaving so
many things unsaid that it says virtually everything. Less effective are
Sheila's troubles after her chair's power runs out, and Thomas'
over-the-top interpretation of his responsibility as number one son. The
tone varies radically as well -- I don't know what twisted flight of
writer/director Peter Mullan's fancy inspired Michael's run-in with an
ill-tempered pub owner -- but on balance the stronger segments and the
solid performances make ORPHANS well worth watching.</P>
<P>     Unless, of course, the subtitles make you want to apply the palm of
your hand to your forehead in a disco beat. It's not just that the
accents, though thick, seem fairly understandable without any visual aids.
It's not just that the subtitler seeks to prove that point by arbitrarily
opting to let several lines of dialogue stand on their own. No, it's
really the cringe-inducing job the subtitler does of not merely
transcribing, but translating (eliminating contextually obvious colloquial 
expressions in favor of their blander synonyms). And not just translating,
but editing (the subtitler steadfastly refuses to place a certain magic
four-letter word on screen, and often substitutes "damn" for "f***ing").
The result is an art house film experience that's intellectually
insulting: a movie delivered to a theatrical audience as though it were
the airline version.</P>
<P>     You can't blame Mullan for such a godawful decision; in fact, I feel
sorry for him. He's made a film which, while flawed, has some provocative
things to say about grief and family, wrapped up in turns of plot and
character that are downright Shakespearean. That should have been the film
American audiences were allowed to see, not this bizarre approximation in
which the subtitles are wrapped around the film like a strip of paper on a
hotel room toilet, sanitizing it for your protection. If this is what
subtitle purists are going to get for their buck, maybe it's time to
reconsider hiring Americans to do a dub job. I can listen to a botched,
scene-ruining translation just as easily as someone I can read it.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 captions outrageous:  5.</PRE>
