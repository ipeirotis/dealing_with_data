<PRE>                        FREE WILLY 3: THE RESCUE
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     "Something just occurred to me," says the oceanic research
scientist hot in pursuit of the illegal whalers.  "When we find them,
what are we going to do?"  Just like the formula script of FREE WILLY
3: THE RESCUE, she does not think ahead.  John Mattson, the writer of
FREE WILLY 2: THE ADVENTURE HOME, again connects the dots to give us
basically the same movie plus one.</P>
<P>     A few minor things have changed.  Jesse, played placidly again by
Jason James Richter, has aged.  To emphasize his maturing, Jessie first
appears driving along, flirting with a carload of girls, and listening
to rock n' roll.  Having gotten that over with, he goes back to being a
17-year-old who plays a part better suited to a younger actor.  The
script attempts to compensate by giving him a job as a research
assistant and by providing him with a younger sidekick.</P>
<P>     The setup for this retelling of the FREE WILLY story has the
oceanic researcher, Drew, played without emotion by Annie Corley,
noting that the Orca population is down by 10 per cent and that it is
their mission to find out why.  Besides Jesse and the ship's captain
and mate, Randolph is on board.  Randolph, played by August
Schellenberg, is again the most animated of the characters.</P>
<P>     Among the best and worst parts of the plot are the villains.  The
head of the whalers is a third generation whaler named John Wesley.
Played by Patrick Kilpatrick, John is the only complex character in the
story.  In easily the most refreshing part of the picture, the film
explores briefly the other side of an environmental issue.  Hollywood
long ago decided that when it comes to the environment, there is only
one defensible position.  This script, on the other hand, explains
John's life as a whaler with some sympathy to his admittedly illegal
profession.  John tells his son Max, played wide-eyed by ten-year-old
Vincent Berry, that his grandfather proudly harvested the whale oil
that was used to light the lamps of America.  (Max ends up bonding with
Jesse and the whales and turning against his father's work albeit not
really against his father per se.)</P>
<P>     The problem with this approach is that it becomes hard to hate a
bad guy who seems trapped in his profession and who is such a good
father.  Without an adequate villain, the show lacks much credible
tension.</P>
<P>     TV director Sam Pillsbury's film feels like a direct-to-video
production, which is how the inevitable FREE WILLY 4 should be
marketed.  As a two dollar rental that only the kids watch, the movie
becomes a more palatable proposition.  Within the confines of a
theater, Pillsbury's lethargic pacing and the script's paucity of ideas
become all too apparent.</P>
<P>     The dialog is full of the platitudes one might find in a
substandard third grade reader.  Typical is John's lecture to his son.
"Whales aren't people," he argues.  "They don't feel.  They're just
fish."</P>
<P>     The only reason to see the show are the frolicking whale
sequences, framed nicely by the rugged mountains of the Pacific
Northwest coast.  As the big black and white beauties go splashing in
the deep blue waters, the sun glistens on the ocean's surface.  The
most remarkable scenes are those shot underwater, featuring close-ups
of the people and the whales looking eye-to-eye.  The whale is as
naturally at home there as the people are shocked to be paddling in
front of a whale's mouth.  Still, a half hour short film of just these
scenes would have been much preferable to a feature length movie padded
with the recycled material from the last two movies in the series.</P>
<P>     If your kids want to see this film, try to talk up the advantages
of waiting for it to come out on video.  Maybe by then they will have
forgotten, and you can suggest some much better show at the video
rental store instead.</P>
<P>     FREE WILLY 3: THE RESCUE runs 1:26.  It is rated PG for whale
hunting and one barroom fight.  The scene where WILLY gets shot with a
spear may be too much for kids under 6, but for older ones the show
would be fine.  My son Jeffrey, age 8, thought the film was great but
complained that all the FREE WILLY pictures have the same story.  Why
can't they do something different, he argued.  My sentiments exactly.
I give thumbs down to this lame rehash and award it * 1/2 for at least
having the courage to try to tell two sides of an environmental issue.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
