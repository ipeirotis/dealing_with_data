<PRE>GOSSIP
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>A concept alone does not a movie make.  Applying chaos theory to rumor
deployment, GOSSIP tells what happens when a group of college students
plant a false story.  Like a computer virus, the rumor spreads rapidly,
harming more than the intended victim.</P>
<PRE>That's the theory anyway.</PRE>
<P>Working from an underdeveloped and ridiculous script by Gregory Poirier
and Theresa Rebeck, Davis Guggenheim directs GOSSIP with meat cleaver
subtlety.  It's too bad that the director didn't throw up his hands and
go for pure camp.  The over-the-top, creepy music (Graeme Revell) and
the ominously dark cinematography (Andrzej Bartkowiak) would have nicely
supported such an approach.  As those of you unlucky enough to have seen
BODY SHOTS last year will notice, the art design looks similar, right
down to the silly, pastel cocktails, served in a rainbow of colors.  As
a parody, the film might have at least worked its way up to a guilty
pleasure.  But, it is not to be.  The director buys into the pretentious
and preposterous story, producing groans from the audience instead of
laughter.</P>
<P>As the movie opens, a professor (Eric Bogosian) is teaching what appears
to be a course in rumor mongering at Jerry Springer U.  As he flashes
tabloid headlines on the screen behind him, he quizzes his pupils on the
relationship between gossip and the mass media.  Three of his students,
Derrick  (James Marsden), Jones (Lena Headey) and Travis (Norman
Reedus), are roommates and best buds.  Partly as a lark and partly to
injure a girl whom they don't like, they decide to plant a rumor about
her and see where it goes.</P>
<P>Naomi (Kate Hudson), the richest kid on a wealthy campus, has made a big
splash by renouncing sex -- shocking!  She is an old-fashioned girl who
is saving herself for marriage.  The Gossip 3 decide to plant a rumor
that Naomi's boyfriend, Beau (Joshua Jackson from THE SKULLS), had sex
with her at a party after she passed out.  The story gets changed many
times in the telling.  For a while the word on the street is that she
had sex with multiple partners on the fire escape and that she wears
rubber bras.  Eventually, however, the rumor solidifies into date rape
by Beau, who is charged by the cops.</P>
<P>In a film full of ludicrous moments, permit me to choose a favorite.
After consistently spurning Derrick's sexual advances, since they are
all 3 buddies, Jones finally yields to him just after learning something
terrible about him.  And she does this with Travis nearby, awkwardly
trying to ignore their sexual grunts while working on his computer.</P>
<P>The movie is filled with thoughts that will make your blood boil.
"We're in college," Derrick tells his two buddies in justification for
the catastrophic consequences of their actions.  "This is the time of
our lives when we're supposed to be making mistakes."</P>
<P>"I don't even know what I'm doing," Travis says of his art.  (I forgot
to tell you.  He finds a way to turn their rumor mill into an art
montage that covers his walls and that Derrick figures can be Travis's
term project for art class.)  The director might say the same of his
movie, which he directs with plodding lethargy.</P>
<P>But, if you have any doubt as to who or what killed the movie, wait for
the ending.  Derision and catcalls are liable to fill the air in your
theater as it did it ours during the ending scene.  The script did it.</P>
<P>GOSSIP runs 1:30.  It is rated R for sexual content, language and brief
violence and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
