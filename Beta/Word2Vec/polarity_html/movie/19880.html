<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Simply put, this is one of the best crime films ever made. Especially
considering that it was made on a budget of only $230,000. It most
closely resembles in style and scope the work of the great French
directors Jean-Pierre Melville and Jacques Becker, as a classic noir
tale depicting man's foibles of greed and betrayal.The killing here
refers to a heist of the racetrack for a sum of 2 million dollars, as
planned by ex-con Johnny Clay (Sterling), who rounds up a crew of
nonprofessional criminals for this caper. He wants to make one big score
before retiring. The robbery itself is told in multiple flashback style,
as each character gets a chance to tell his version of the story, which
is done in parts, so that each character's story is not only told but
the film is able to jump back and forth in time, allowing for several
events to happen together.</P>
<P>The cuckolded George Peatty (Elisha) is a race track betting window
cashier, Mike O'Reilly (Joe Sawyer) is a racetrack bartender with a sick
wife, Randy (Corsia) is a corrupt cop, Marvin Unger (Flippen) is the one
bankrolling the job, Nikki Arane (Carey) is the memorable psychotic
marksman hired for $2,500 to kill a racehorse, Maurice (Kola) is a
chessplaying strongman who for $5,000 will cause a fight at the track
and thereby create a necessary disturbance, calling for lots of police.
Each one's job is a key one in helping Johnny gain entry to the office
where the money is kept. If they don't work in coordination with each
other, the plan wouldn't work.</P>
<P>The complications to this well-planned scheme come through George's sexy
wife Sherry, the femme fatale, who is seeing a petty gangster behind
George's back, Val (Vince). She is shrewdly able to sneak the details of
the robbery out of her dim husband, whom she detests as much as he
worships her. She also clearly had the two best lines in the film: If
people didn't have headaches, what would happen to the aspiren industry?
When George kills her after she betrays him, she is able to say right
before keeling over, "This is a bad joke without a punch line."</P>
<P>When Nikki kills the racehorse, he is immediately shot.The rest of the
robbery goes smoothly, but when Johnny returns to pay off the boys,
Sherry's two henchmen, who got there first, kill every one except for
George, who kills them and then goes back to his place to get Sherry; he
will subsequently die from his wounds. Meanwhile, Johnny and his
girlfriend get unlucky at the airport, as their suitcase full of money
opens up and scatters all over the airport. As Johnny is taken into
custody at the airport terminal by a pair of detectives, he is too weary
to make a run for it.</P>
<P>What makes this film so tense and gripping, is the exacting details that
went into making this caper work, as it is seen through the eyes of the
odd mixture of characters who commit the robbery. Each one drooling for
their share of the easy money, unconcerned that they have become blind
about the criminal act they are doing. The point made, is a theme that
Kubrick will return to many times in his long career in films, that
their perfect robbery fails because of the human condition they couldn't
control and not because the robbery wasn't perfectly executed.</P>
<P>The main protaganist shows that he is capable of loyalty and love, and
of possibly leading a virtuous life, but whose downfall comes about when
he can't stop being a criminal to gain the something he can't find
inside his true nature. It fits in with Kubrick's notion of life: that
it is vital for one to see how the pieces are played out on the chess
board and how the player who does not always have the best strategy or
execution can still win by learning how to persevere and change as the
game does. As one of Kubrick's early features, it remains one of his
greatest films, even without the added visual dimensions he was to pour
into his later high-budget, more complex movies. The outstanding cast
made everything look natural, and the gritty realism of the story was
only enhanced by the glorious b/w cinematography.</P>
