THE FAMILY MAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Nicolas Cage, as Jack Campbell, the wealthy president of a 
mergers-and-acquisitions firm, is living La Dolce Vita in his Manhattan 
penthouse and savoring every minute of it.  With $2,400 suits, a 
lightning-fast Ferrari and his own limo, he has it all, right down to a 
"closet" that is like an expensive men's clothing boutique.</P>
<P>Well he thinks he has it all until an angry man with a gun (Don Cheadle) 
interrupts Jack's life to show him a "glimpse" of what he is missing.  
David Diamond and David Weissman's imaginative script is equal parts 
SLIDING DOORS, A CHRISTMAS CAROL and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.   Director 
Brett Ratner, known for his broad comedy RUSH HOUR, shows that he is 
capable of surprising subtlety and grace.  THE FAMILY MAN is touching 
and poignant without ever getting anywhere near schmaltz.  Even if it's 
more effective as a romantic drama than a comedy, it does have many 
wonderfully funny moments.</P>
<P>The story opens at the airport in 1987, where Jack is leaving his 
college girlfriend Kate (Téa Leoni, DEEP IMPACT) for a one-year 
internship abroad.  Fearing that their relationship will not survive the 
oceanic separation, she makes a futile, last minute plea for him to 
stay.</P>
<P>We quickly cut to 13 years later, when it's Christmas Eve.  Jack has his 
troops working on a 120-billion dollar merger deal.  His old lover, 
Kate, has called out of the blue.  Jack's chairman (Josef Sommer) 
advises him not to return the call.  "Old flames are like old tax 
returns," he tells Jack.  "Put 'em in a file cabinet for 3 years and 
then cut 'em loose."  Currently with model-quality girlfriends, Jack 
doesn't seem the least bit interested in ever dialing Kate's number.</P>
<P>The mysterious character played by Don Cheadle shows up, and before Jack 
knows it, he is "trapped in the suburbs" in a New Jersey house with 4 
bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths, a partially finished basement, a big slobbering 
dog, 2 young kids and a wife, Kate.  He thinks that he is still rich, 
but he isn't, and that he really isn't the family man of his new 
household, but he is.  Cage's frozen, wide-eyed expression tells it all 
about his absolute panic.  He is convincingly confused, shocked, lost 
and scared.   Most of all Jack is appalled by the ordinariness of his 
new lifestyle.  A big day for the new Jack is getting treated to a 
funnel cake at the mall.  His new life is almost a complete opposite of 
everything he has worked for.</P>
<P>In a film about Cage's character, Leoni does a terrific job of not being 
upstaged by Cage.  She takes what could just be a one-dimensional 
character and gives it depth, tenderness and a playful joy.</P>
<P>The script, wisely, lets only one person, Jack's little daughter Annie 
(Makenzie Vega), figure out that Jack has changed.  In an adorable 
performance by Vega, Annie decides that Jack is an alien.  Still, she is 
happy to show him the ropes on how to be a father, including how to 
diaper her brother Josh.  One of the biggest laughs comes when Jack 
leaves Josh at daycare.  "Do I get a receipt or something?" he asks at 
the daycare center as he hands off his son, holding him as if he 
contained toxic waste.</P>
<P>The big question about the narrative is how the story will circle back 
once the glimpse is over.  With a completely satisfying resolution, the 
movie leaves you with a warm spot in your heart.  A perfect film for the 
Christmas season, its messages about the meaning of success and the 
importance of family is presented with straightforward and genuine 
warmth.  An honest picture and a cute one, although not worthy of 
Christmas classic status, it is rewarding and enjoyable.</P>
<P>THE FAMILY MAN runs 2:04.  It is rated PG-13 for sensuality and some 
language and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 11, thought the film was "okay" and gave it **.  He 
complained that he was confused by Cheadle's character.  His favorite 
parts involved the kids and the dog.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, December 22.  
In the Silicon Valley it will be showing at the AMC and the Century 
theaters.  </P>
