<PRE>                              THE FLINTSTONES
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins,
           Rosie O'Donnell, Kyle MacLachlan, Halle Berry,
           Elizabeth Taylor.
Screenplay:  Tom S. Parker & Jim Jennewein and Steven E. de Souza.
Director:  Brian Levant.</P>
<P>     I decided to try something different for THE FLINTSTONES.  I put
aside my critical notebook and tried to clear my mind of all
preconceptions: the thirty-two writers who worked on the script; the
mind-numbing marketing blitz; the dread at the appearance of yet
another TV retread.  And I resolved to let it be what it would be, to
tell myself, Norman Vincent Peale-like, "I will enjoy this film on its
own level."  Do you know what?  It almost worked.  As silly, clunky and
repetitive as THE FLINTSTONES may be, it's still something of a guilty
pleasure, at least on a visual level.  While it's no film for the ages,
neither is it a modern stone-age travesty.</P>
<P>     THE FLINTSTONES gathers the familiar cast of Bedrock denizens from
the 1960's animated series:  Fred (John Goodman) and Wilma (Elizabeth
Perkins) and Barney (Rick Moranis) and Betty (Rosie O'Donnell).  As the
film opens, the Rubbles are just adopting Bam-Bam, thanks to a generous
loan from Fred which improves their credit standing.  As a gesture of
gratitude, Barney secretly switches his results with Fred's on a
management training test at the quarry, knowing Fred did poorly.
Suddenly, Fred finds himself out of the quarry and into the front
office, unbeknownst to him to serve as a yabba-dabba-dupe in an
embezzlement scheme concocted by vice-president Cliff Vandercave (Kyle
MacLachlan) and sexy secretary Sharon Stone (Halle Berry).  Will
success spoil Fred Flintstone?</P>
<P>     It's tempting to call THE FLINTSTONES imaginative, but there
really wouldn't seem to be all that much imagination involved in
directly transferring the animated series to live action.  Every house,
every costume, even every sound effect is instantly recognizable to
anyone who grew up with "The Flintstones" either in first run or
syndication.  Of course, that is the logic behind the glut of TV-based
films:  bring in that elusive older audience with the
nostalgia/recognition factor.  If my audience was any indication, it's
working with THE FLINTSTONES.  While the kids screeched with delight at
the slapstick, the biggest laugh from the adults was reserved for Rosie
O'Donnell's pitch-perfect duplication of Betty's trademark giggle.  The
dinosaur appliances, courtesy of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, are
expertly realized, and the Bedrock town life scenes are well-staged by
director Brian Levant.  I generally found myself entertained while I
took in the production design and admired its whimsical authenticity.</P>
<P>     There is, however, one major problem with the casting, and it
comes as quite a surprise.  While it would seem that John Goodman was
born to play Fred Flintstone, he never looks quite comfortable.
Physically, he pulls his punches more often than not, as though he
didn't understand just how far overboard he should go in a live action
cartoon; in his delivery, he struggles with the blustering voice
originated by Alan Reed, and appears to be re-routing it through Jackie
Gleason (whose "Honeymooners" character Ralph Kramden was the model for
Fred Flintstone).  Goodman's relatively weak Fred unfortunately
overshadows his solid castmates.  Rick Moranis is an appealingly
amiable Barney, and Rosie O'Donnell, while not ideal physically as
Betty, had the mannerisms down pat.  Elizabeth Perkins has the
low-impact role as Wilma, but she too is on target.  And it may be
worth the price of admission just to see Elizabeth Taylor, as Wilma's
mother, tied up and gagged and lying on the ground.</P>
<P>     One interesting by-product came out of seeing THE FLINTSTONES:  I
realized that I had under-appreciated the ADDAMS FAMILY films.  Like
those films, THE FLINTSTONES primarily offers as its humor variations
on a single theme.  But the ADDAMS outings at least seemed occasionally
inspired; THE FLINTSTONES is content just to show up and toss off the
expected "rock" and "stone" puns.  This is especially disconcerting
when a FLINTSTONES franchise may be as close to a sure thing as there
is in Hollywood.  The first time around, THE FLINTSTONES' visuals are a
light-hearted kick, but there's nothing more to do.  I could write that
sequel given a day and a half ... and a $40 million budget.</P>
<PRE>     On the Rockshaw scale of 0 to 10:  5.</PRE>
