<P>Synopsis:  In "sooner than you think" America, the future of law
enforcement resides in Blade Squad, a ragtag group of culturally diverse
rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs.  A dangerous
criminal, however, attempts to destroy Blade Squad after his brother dies
while being chased by them.  </P>
<P>Comments:  So, what do an ex-gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop, a
former prostitute with a substance abuse problem, and a junkie turned
Dennis Rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have
in common?  Why, they're all members of BLADE SQUAD, an elite new
crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms, rollerblades, and jetpacks!
They also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la
the marines in James Cameron's ALIENS.  Yes, it's BLADE SQUAD, the Fox
Network's Wednesday Night Movie of the Week.  This "movie," marking its
dubious world premiere today, curiously has a number of guest stars.  "How
can a movie have guest stars?" you may ask.  Well, BLADE SQUAD is not
really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible TV series
packaged as a movie.  BLADE SQUAD is dumb.  BLADE SQUAD is loud.  BLADE
SQUAD is obnoxious.  BLADE SQUAD will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a
long-lived TV series.  Why not?  After all, television has given its
audience crimefighters with talking cars ("Knight Rider"), fast helicopters
("Airwolf"), and super fast motorcycles ("Street Hawk"), and viewers have
eaten it up in the past.  So, why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller
blades?</P>
<P>To be honest, as a made-for-TV presentation, BLADE SQUAD is at least
watchable.  The film has a relatively large cast of characters, a
surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script, and enough action
sequences to keep one half-interested.  I'd imagine adolescent males,
probably the target audience of this turkey, would get a kick out of it.  I
tried to keep that in mind when I watched BLADE SQUAD.  I can remember
liking "Airwolf" and "Street Hawk" when I was 10 or 11.  And, although this
isn't saying much, BLADE SQUAD is leaps and bounds better than the last Fox
network movie I had the displeasure of wasting time on: the insipidly awful
GENERATION X (a huge disappointment considering the comic book's terrific
two-year beginning).  But, I digress.  </P>
<P>Despite its limited appeal, BLADE SQUAD has a lot of kinks to work out if
the movie is to become a TV series.  One, it suffers from MTV syndrome: a
lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer's senses
while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the
background.  Oh yeah, Dylan's "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" and Bowie's "I'm
Afraid of Americans" are used here, in rather poor taste.  Two, BLADE SQUAD
needs a new crew for the sound.  The substandard sound editing irritated me
to no end.  Characters' dialogue, at times, sounded choppy and
unintelligible.  During one important scene, a song played loudly in the
background.  When a character spoke, the song's volume dropped but did not
disappear.  As soon as that character finished speaking, the song's volume
immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke.
This sounds trivial, I'm sure, but it distracted me immensely.  Finally,
this is commercial television.  Foul language is not allowed, typically, on
commercial television.  Thus, don't use foul language in a made-for-TV
production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner.
In an early scene of the film, for example, the lead good guy and bad guy
have a minor confrontation in the streets.  When the good guy spouts out a
bad word, a driver conveniently honks his car's horn off-screen to muffle
the word out.  In a "Seinfeld" episode, this technique proved funny; here,
it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably.  Perhaps future
writers, if a show is spun out of the movie, could take a cue from Marvel
Comics' 2099 series of comics.  Make up a bunch of new bad words for the
future.  This way, you don't need a bunch of honking horns or other silly
devices to cover up foul language.  </P>
<P>Compared to the usual crap broadcast TV networks have to offer in terms of
movies, BLADE SQUAD is a suitable exercise in camp.  When compared to, say,
a movie studio film, BLADE SQUAD has a lot in common with a term which
shares its initials: BS.  (Review written August 12, 1998)</P>
