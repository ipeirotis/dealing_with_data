<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A slow developing tale about a university professor in a small northern
India town, who is hassled when trying to get an interview with someone
he idolizes, India's greatest living Urdu poet (it's a fictional
characterization). I guess to really enjoy this film, you would have to
speak the language to understand its poetical nuances, otherwise the
poetry as presented didn't seem like much. As well-acted and crafted a
film as this directorial debut was for Ismail Merchant, it still failed
to make the story interesting for a wider audience, as the poetry fell
on deaf Western ears even though the story's heart seemed to be in the
right place. The film still seemed to be too dry to care about an
unfamiliar Muslim language and an intellectual culture no longer in
vogue, dying a slow death. As worthwhile a project as it is, as adapted
from Anita Desai's 1987 novel, in which she also does the screenplay, it
still is hard to bring an intact literary work and make it viable as a
cinematic experience without changing it. The film's main failure is
that it never comes to life as a moving poetical work but always seems
like an academic exercise, through no fault of the director.</P>
<P>Deven (Om Puri) complains about the unruly college students he teaches
Hindi to and snaps at his overburdened and frustrated wife Sarla (Neena
Gupta), who is fed up with being a housewife and not appreciated. They
live in Mirpir with their precocious young son Manu (Tinnu Anand), where
the family is mainly concerned about money problems and with the father
being too busy to spend more time with the family. Deven, in an attempt
to keep Urdu alive, contributes articles to a small literary magazine in
his spare time. The magazine's editor Murad (Tinnu Anand) visits him
from the nearby bigger city of Bhopal and asks him to get an interview
with the once famous Urdu poet Nur (Shashi Kapoor) who is living in
retirement in Bhopal. The amateur poet in Urdu is more than pleased to
do so, though he does not feel secure that he is up to the task. He
meets the great man in his home, and is disappointed by what he sees.
Firstly, the poet has two wives who are competing for his attention by
constantly quibbling with each other. The older first wife (Sushma Seth)
is a harpy, who has charge of the downstairs in the large house and is
reduced to doing the cooking for the family. The much younger second
wife (Shabana Azmi), who bore him his only son and has a nasty
disposition--was working in a local brothel when he met her, though now
she aspires to be a poetess. He is an obese man in failing health, also
suffering from alcoholism, sloth, and having a rabble group of admirers
who shamelessly leech off him. The elderly poet hangs around with these
idlers everyday, which is making his ulcers even worse.</P>
<P>The first meeting between the admired poet and the lowly university
teacher goes poorly, as the poet gets drunk with his group of admirers,
and vomits in his second wife's bedroom. She treats the guest with
contempt, thinking he is just another one of the poet's foolish admirers
and makes him clean up the mess as if he were a servant.</P>
<P>Somehow, Deven gets invited back to the house and plans with the first
wife how to get the reluctant Nur to give him this interview for
posterity. The problem is that she wants money to arrange for the poetry
reading and for the private room he would need to get him away from the
second wife, who will not allow for the interview. But Deven's magazine
refuses to give the money and he has to go begging the college officials
for it. He finally manages to squeeze a little money out of the college
Registrar, saying that he will make a tape-recording and the college can
have the poet's voice to use as a valuable resource for its classes.</P>
<P>As things continue to go wrong for the serious-minded but naive Deven,
he finds that no one really cares about the poet, his poetry, and the
Urdu language, and he is stuck with being the only one who can do
something to save the language and restore its usage in intellectual
circles. The flawed poet has the even larger task, of being viewed as a
symbol for the entire Urdu tradition.</P>
<P>Deven gets a chance to hear sexy wife number 2 sing Nur's poems, as all
the admirers sit around and get their rocks off as she stirs them up
with sexual intonations and lyrics that go like this: "O candle, for the
sake of the moth do this little favor ... Flare up once and then die."
It must have been a cultural thing, because it went by me. To me, her
performance seemed as if it was as gaudy as an Esther Williams bathing
suit number in a Hollywood pulp film.</P>
<P>Once the poet is being audio taped in the private room, after Deven has
put his job on the line by taking off three days to make the tape, the
trouble begins, as he had to buy a secondhand tape-recorder that is not
reliable, and since he is not handy, as part of the deal he gets the
proprietor's moronic relative to work the machine. But he is more
harmful than helpful. The poet himself is only interested in getting
Deven to supply his admirers with rum and Biryani, and gives Deven very
little on tape that is useful. These scenes were played as lowbrow
comedy, showing the clumsiness of Deven in handling the tapes and the
awkward situation he was in.</P>
<P>The film ends with a heavy-handed symbolic message, which summarizes the
struggle to preserve the old traditions and clearly shows the director's
obvious love for Urdu, as an old rundown but beautiful mansion in Bhopal
owned by Deven's departmental chairman, is being knocked down to make
way for a shopping center, as the chairman, an enthusiast for Urdu, is
only happy about the money he is receiving for the property and could
care less about the historical value of his mansion.</P>
<P>The acting performances by Shashi Kapoor and Om Puri deserve special
praise. But I'm afraid the film was too stilted and unmoving; and, it
failed to capture the beauty of the ancient poetical language on film.</P>
