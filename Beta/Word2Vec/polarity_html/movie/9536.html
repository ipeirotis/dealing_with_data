<PRE>                        TELLING LIES IN AMERICA
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Controversial screenwriter Joe Eszterhas has a reputation for
producing pictures that push the edge of the acceptability envelope.
>From his highly successful BASIC INSTINCT to his widely ridiculed
SHOWGIRLS, he has managed to deliver many high profile and lucrative
scripts and has been called the highest paid screenwriter in the world.
When he was starting out, he made many excellent but less controversial
movies, including JAGGED EDGE and that perennial favorite, FLASHDANCE.
(One of the big hits of this year's art house circuit has been THE FULL
MONTY, and in it the amateur male strippers use FLASHDANCE as their
instructional video.)</P>
<P>     Before the house lights went down at the press screening for
Eszterhas's most recent film, TELLING LIES IN AMERICA, I read through
the press kit.  Apparently this was supposed to be a touching little
film about a teenage immigrant's experience growing up in America and
was a "semi-auto-biographical tale."  Eszterhas himself came from
Hungary at the age of 6 to live in Cleveland.  By the time the house
lights had come back up, I was surprised to have found that the film
was exactly as billed.  The story had many opportunities to get
outlandish and rejected them all in favor of serious character
development.  Although far from an outstanding film, the people in it
will touch your heart.</P>
<P>     Set in Cleveland in the rock 'n roll year of 1960, the movie tells
the story of an itinerant disk jockey whose current pseudonym is Billy
Magic.  Billy, played with a sleazy panache by Kevin Bacon in one of
his few bad guy roles, travels the DJ circuit gathering payola.
Whenever the heat from the local police gets too hot for him, he
crosses the state line and picks a new moniker.  His MO includes
carefully choosing a juvenile boy to be his bag man.  With the record
producers giving the money to an underage kid, Billy stays clean, or at
least clean enough to afford him time to beat a hasty exit when the
cops start closing in on him.</P>
<P>     Although Bacon's charismatic performance dominates the film, Brad
Renfro as Karchy Jonas gets more of the screen time.  Renfro and Bacon
worked together in last year's outstanding but underappreciated
SLEEPERS.  This time Renfro has grown up more and plays the high school
senior whom Billy uses as his shield against prosecution.  Renfro's
serious character contrasts nicely with Billy's flashy persona.  Karchy
lives with his somber and hard working father Dr. Istvan Jonas, played
by a difficult to recognize Maximilian Schell.  Dr. Jonas got his Ph.D.
in law from a Hungarian university, but barely scrapes by in this
country by working at a mill.  His wife died in the refugee camps in
the old country.</P>
<P>     Even when the story saddens, as it does frequently, the high
energy music of the era gives the story its hopeful underpinnings.
Billy's gaudy clothes by Laura Cunningham and Heather Priest and his
fire-engine red 1959 Cadillac convertible, with fins high enough to
scrape the moon, make him the idol of the local girls, who are dying to
go to bed with him.</P>
<P>     The sweetest subplot in the picture surrounds Karchy's first
girlfriend, a young woman named Diney Majeski, played with grace and
confidence by Calista Flockhart from THE BIRDCAGE.  Diney, being older
and wiser than Karchy, tries to help him come to terms with his
immaturity and lack of self-confidence.  "Why you got to show off so
much?" she asks.  In a revealing reply, he says it's "cause I ain't got
that much to show."</P>
<P>     The dialog, while rarely memorable, has a honesty that sounds like
it was lifted straight from a time capsule.  When cocky Billy inquires
about Karchy's sexual maturity, he couches it in just the right slang.
"Have you done the nasty yet?" Billy asks him.  Karchy lies rather than
reveal the truth.  "Lots of times," he shoots back.</P>
<P>     After seeing too many films lately in which none of the characters
are drawn sympathetically, it is refreshing to have one in which they
are all worth caring about.  Even if Billy is conning everyone, you
can't help but love him.</P>
<P>     TELLING LIES IN AMERICA runs 1:41.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual
situations and some profanity.  The film would be fine for kids twelve
and up.</P>
