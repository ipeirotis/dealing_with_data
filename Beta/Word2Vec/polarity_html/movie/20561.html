<PRE>THE STRAIGHT STORY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Walt Disney presents a G-rated movie by David Lynch.</P>
<P>Yes, that David Lynch.  The one that did BLUE VELVET, TWIN PEAKS and
LOST HIGHWAY and about the last director you'd expect to hook up with
Disney to do a live-action, G-rated film based on a true story.  What's
next?  Brian De Palma with a sequel to BAMBI?</P>
<P>Every week, it seems, brings another absolutely trivial coming-of-age
movie featuring a bunch of crude, oversexed teens.  In stark contrast,
THE STRAIGHT STORY is a closing-of-age story filled with a generous
spirit and wonderfully sympathetic characters.  It never toys with your
emotions or insults your intelligence.</P>
<P>At the heart of the story, Richard Farnsworth (THE GREY FOX) gives an
Oscar worthy performance as 73-year-old Alvin Straight, a man on a
mission.  Alvin, who looks a decade older than his age, is in rapidly
failing health.  His doctor says he has emphysema and must give up
smoking -- fat chance.  Only with the help of his two canes is he able
to hobble around.</P>
<P>All of the above notwithstanding, when he hears that his estranged
brother has had a stroke, Alvin sets off to see him, no matter how
difficult the trip is certain to be.  Farnsworth with his intense eyes
and the small curls of his lips displays Alvin's resoluteness and his
suppressed pain.  Every furrow of his brow contains some hidden thought
and long repressed regret.  In a highly nuanced performance, Farnsworth
with tiny gestures reveals much but suggests more.</P>
<P>Sissy Spacek, in a small but important role, plays his grown daughter,
Rose.  Everyone says Rose, who has an unusual speech impediment, is
slow, something that Alvin doesn't buy.  Both Alvin and Rose have known
tragedies that have scarred them, but each has managed to cope.  They
live together in a small house in a typical, little Midwestern town.
She tries to restrain him and remind him of his fragility, but he will
have none of it.  "Rose, Darling, I'm not dead yet," he informs her with
a father's sternness.</P>
<P>Without a driver's license (his bad eyes preclude him from obtaining
one), Alvin sets off on a journey on the only vehicle available to him
-- a small riding lawnmower, three decades old.  Traveling a few miles
per hour, he makes his life's last odyssey, going 350 miles from Iowa to
Wisconsin.  Taking six weeks, his journey becomes a personal crusade
that taps every bit of his resilience.   Frequently looking just two
beats away from a heart attack, he presses on.  A proudly stubborn and
resourceful man, Alvin will let nothing come in the way of his goal.</P>
<P>The movie's delights are in the rich vignettes about the people Alvin
encounters.  A road picture of a very different type than you normally
see, it is that rare movie which you can describe as slow and mean it
sincerely as a compliment.  From the pregnant teenage runaway to the
World War II veteran, the people Alvin meets are beneficiaries of his
small doses of solace and wisdom.</P>
<P>Alvin teaches you to take life one step at a time and relish every
moment.  From small pleasures like the starry sky to more dramatic ones
like watching a lightning storm, he still approaches his surroundings
with the awe of a young lad.</P>
<P>"What's the worst part of being old," one of the young strangers Alvin
meets inquires of him.  "The worst part of being old is remembering when
you were young," Alvin replies with sad, longing eyes.</P>
<P>Some of the people he meets wonder if he isn't scared of camping out in
the middle of nowhere at night, what with all of the weird people about
today.  "I fought in the trenches of World War II," he points out.  "Why
should I be afraid of an Iowa cornfield?"</P>
<P>Lynch, eschewing the many opportunities to turn the story maudlin,
builds a mesmerizing picture that warms your heart without ever
attempting to manipulate it.  The touching story brings you close to a
true individual and reminds you of what our elders are capable.  By the
end, you feel like you've taken an almost spiritual journey with Alvin
and have gotten to witness some superlative acting in the process.</P>
<P>THE STRAIGHT STORY runs 1:41.  It is rated G, and, although it would be
fine for all ages, younger kids will probably find the pacing too slow
to keep their interest.</P>
