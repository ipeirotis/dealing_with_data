<P>     The first misconception to correct about Michael Moore's THE BIG 
ONE is that it is a documentary.  It's not – Moore doesn't make those.  
As was proven after the release of Moore's debut, ROGER & ME, the 
director uses real people, places, and circumstances, then stages events 
(see Harlan Jacobson's piece in the November/December 1989 FILM COMMENT 
for more details).  Reality – a fragile commodity in any "fact-based" 
motion picture – takes a back seat to what will play well on a movie 
screen.  As a result, it's best to consider Moore's films as entries 
into the ever-growing category of pseudo (or "meta") documentaries.  Or, 
perhaps even more accurately, view it as an exercise in self-publicity.  </P>
<P>     Having said that, however, it's necessary for me to point out that 
Moore is a talented film maker who is capable of putting some very funny 
moments on screen.  And, regardless of what methods were used to produce 
the movie, it still makes an extremely valid point about the way big 
business mistreats its workers, laying off people and transferring 
manufacturing to third-world countries rather than sacrificing a little 
profit.  Having been "downsized" myself, I understand and share Moore's 
anger.  With ROGER & ME and THE BIG ONE, he has become the motion 
picture industry's champion of the "little guy."</P>
<P>     THE BIG ONE is a filmed diary of a book signing tour Moore embarked 
upon to promote his 1997 bestseller, DOWNSIZE THIS!  From St. Louis to 
Milwaukee to Portland, he moves across the country, scrawling his 
autograph on the inside covers of books, visiting corporate headquarters 
in fruitless attempts to see CEOs, and doing bitingly funny standup acts 
at universities and during other public speaking engagements.  Moore's 
theme, italicized through humor, is always the same:  that corporate 
America, in bed with politicians, is raping the common man.  It's all 
about greed.  At various times, he calls the leaders of major companies 
"terrorists" and "murderers."  And he has the evidence to back up the 
charges.</P>
<P>     THE BIG ONE is a hit-and-miss affair.  Some of the episodes 
detailing Moore's repeated failed tries to meet with CEOs (Leaf, Johnson 
Controls, Pillsbury, and Proctor & Gamble are all targets) become 
tiresome, and it's a little troubling how much grief he gives the 
average working guys who stop him (they are, after all, ordinary men and 
women trying to hold down a job – the kind of people Moore proclaims to 
be a voice for).  Moore also has a tendency to dwell on the obvious, 
such as how corrupt and subservient to big business the political 
process has become.</P>
<P>     On the other hand, THE BIG ONE also boasts some noteworthy scenes.  
One particularly disarming moment features a woman near to tears 
confessing to Moore that she has just been laid off.  The film maker, 
apparently not expecting this, seems genuinely moved by her plight.  On 
another occasion, Moore relates how Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan 
accepted a contribution from a group called the "Abortionists for 
Buchanan," how President Clinton took a check from the "Hemp Growers of 
America," and how Ross Perot felt compelled to reject $100 from the 
"Pedophiles for Free Trade."  There's a revelation about how much 
nearly-free prison labor is employed by large corporations – the next 
time a telemarketer calls, it may actually be someone in a jail cell.  
Finally, there's a hilarious proposal about how to reduce the nation's 
drug problem.</P>
<P>     The film's climax (inasmuch as a rambling pseudo-documentary can 
have a climax) features Moore's face-to-face meeting with Nike CEO Phil 
Knight.  It's not a particularly satisfying encounter for either man.  
Moore doesn't press very hard on the tough questions and Knight comes 
across as more out-of-touch than genuinely malevolent.  Like most of the 
rest of the film, this sequence gets the point across without offering 
much depth.  As for the title, there's actually a little mystery about 
what THE BIG ONE refers to – as far as I can tell, it's either the 
United States of America or Michael Moore's ego.</P>
