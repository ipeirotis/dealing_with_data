<PRE>                                    SHOWGIRLS
                       A film review by Gharlane of Eddore
                        Copyright 1995 Gharlane of Eddore</PRE>
<PRE>SHOWGIRLS  * * *  out of  * * * *  possible.</PRE>
<P>     SHOWGIRLS is the second major outing for the production team of
Pual Verhoeven, director, and Joe Eszterhas, writer.   Their last
effort, BASIC INSTINCT, played like the most sumptuous of classic
Hitchcock, with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come
across with a hit like curry-spiced Tabasco sauce; a dish not to
everyone's taste, but certainly a well-crafted movie.  Possibly that
movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened
offstage, prior to the movie, during the movie, and after the movie...
and that, after bringing all the plotlines together neatly, it left the
viewer with full knowledge of what *would* happen in the characters'
future, so there was no need to film it.   There was actually about
four hours' worth of screen story there, but Eszterhas found ways to
get it all on-screen in two, by leading his audience into analyzing
what was really going on; and by still holding their interest with
clever misdirection and false trails.</P>
<P>     The major elements that made BASIC INSTINCT work so well are
present in SHOWGIRLS.  We have attractive, sympathetic, but still
highly repellent characters; we have shows for the eyes and the ears,
plotlines that play on several levels, we have beautifully delineated
characters who are drawn from life and very believable, and we have a
story of an innocent (who may not be so innocent) who's trying to play
straight, trying to improve her station in life, who slips into
behaving the way those around her do... but recovers with a flourish,
and quits a winner.</P>
<P>     In this sense, the movie is a bit of a departure for Verhoeven,
who's not known for treating his characters well; but Nomi, the part
played by Elizabeth Berkley, definitely opts out of the game in a
positive way, and we're left feeling good about her future.  This is
not one of the great movies, but it's far better than we'd been led to
expect by all the negative pre-release publicity.  Verhoeven got his
first Oscar nomination in 1971, and in the last quarter-century has
pushed farther and farther, experimenting with the socially-acceptable
limits to movie-making.  His most recent three movies, ROBOCOP, TOTAL
RECALL, and BASIC INSTINCT, have been a progression of back-door access
to American culture, moving from the fantastic through the merely
psychotic to the underlying basic drives; and now he's exploring the
sleeze.  This movie may be the first movie ever made for which the
director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not
have to deliver an R rated movie.  (Verhoeven had to cut several parts
of BASIC INSTINCT to get an R rating, although his original version is
available on video.)</P>
<P>     Many reviewers have taken the Politically-Correct stance that any
movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a Bad Thing; but they miss
the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies, it's about people
in an environment where naked ladies are common, and WHY such an
environment should exist.  It's about the scum who use other people as
power-trip toys, and the need to escape their power.  It's about a
world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain; and
the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most
blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment.  An NC-17 movie which
isn't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and
emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of
beauty, power, or value.  The one scene in the movie that *could* have
been a good sex scene, Berkley and MacLachlan in a swimming pool, is
not exciting, because by then we already know his character is a
callous manipulator.  If anything, it's a rape scene with a victim
who's been duped into cooperation.</P>
<P>     You don't make a movie about the history of black people in
America without using a few black actors; you don't make a movie about
World War II without a few guns going off and a few people getting
killed; and you don't make a movie about Las Vegas showgirls without
showing a few Las Vegas showgirls ... and in an awful lot of Vegas
shows, an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing.  This is a
legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment
industry, in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity.</P>
<P>     SHOWGIRLS de-glamorizes the Las Vegas show and sex industries with
great effectiveness.</P>
<P>     Nomi is played, in a very good performance, by Elizabeth Berkley,
who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who's at
the end of her rope, desperate to live a life better than the one she's
known.  She has nothing to market except her body and her limited
dancing ability, and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker,
trying to be something better than she seems destined to be.  When Nomi
realizes she's gone too far for too little, she catches herself just in
time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be.</P>
<P>     Gina Rivera plays Molly, a dressmaker and costumer who befriends
Nomi, providing her with what may be the one solid, positive
relationship in Nomi's entire life.  Molly is the one who makes the
difference, and provides the role model and framework Nomi needs to
verify the value system she'll be using for the REST of her life, and
Nomi's feelings for Molly are the spur that forces Nomi's decision.
Gina Gershon plays Cristal, an aging, but still very attractive
starring dancer, a reflexively competitive manipulator who's become a
villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around
her.  Gershon plays Cristal as a cross between Ava Gardner and Raquel
Welch; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness.  Her character is
very well drawn and performed; in a major scene in a hospital room, she
acknowledges what she is, and, in essence, passes the torch to Nomi.
The relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the
movie, and provides part of the impetus Nomi needs to follow a
different path.</P>
<P>     It is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are
women of different stripe; Molly is an honest, hard-working person who
means well, and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the
image with reality.  Cristal is a talented dancer who's compromised her
ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system,
exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in
Las Vegas.  Nomi believes she can make it without selling herself,
succumbs to a degree, and then realizes she CAN make it without selling
herself, and doesn't need Las Vegas or its brand of "stardom."</P>
<P>     The male parts in this movie are simply props; they exist only to
demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls
exist.  Kyle MacLachlan, whose single best previous work was as an
inhumanly emotionless cop in THE HIDDEN, gives us a nicely reptilian
bit of pond scum on two legs, camouflaged as a nice guy.  Glenn Plummer
plays a dancer who's working as a bellboy, and provides a bit of
alternate perspective.  Plummer's character is the only one in the
movie who's maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art, but
even he's succumbed to the cult of manipulation.  Plummer's character
is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole
movie.</P>
<P>     Some of Jost Vacano's cinematography is fantastic, and one
particular delineation of Nomi's character alteration, a no-dialog
scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting, is utterly
terrifying.</P>
<P>     This movie is rated NC-17 due to language, sexual situations, full
frontal nudity, violence, and probably the costuming as well.  I don't
see a way this particular story could have been told well without it,
and I regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making.  But don't go
see it if you're not in a tough mood; the only person it's possible to
like in this movie ends up in an I.C.U. on life support, and there is
probably not one character in this movie you'd enjoy meeting in
person.</P>
