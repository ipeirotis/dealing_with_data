<P>     LITTLE ODESSA, the stunning feature debut of 24-year old 
writer/director James Gray, is about to become the victim of distributor 
politics.  As a result of recent changes in upper management, Fine Line 
Features has chosen to limit--if not completely withdraw--support 
for this film.  Considering the strength of the material, the adeptness 
of Gray's direction, and several memorable performances, this is a 
classic case of cinematic injustice.  LITTLE ODESSA deserves to be seen 
by as many movie-goers as possible, not just those living in the few 
locations where Fine Line choses to release it. </P>
<P>     At the focal point is Joshua Shapira (Tim Roth), a deeply-troubled, 
emotionally detached hit man who has come home to Brooklyn to commit an 
assassination.  Although difficulties in his past make it dangerous for 
him to be seen near Brighten Beach, the real impediment to a return is 
his father, Arkady (Maximilian Schell).  For, while Josh loves his dying 
mother, Irina (Vanessa Redgrave), and his younger brother, Reuben 
(Edward Furlong), there is nothing but antipathy between father and 
eldest son.  Nevertheless, left without a choice, Josh ventures back to 
the Russian/Jewish community, and eventually encounters all the members 
of his family.  While there, he also hooks up with an old girlfriend, 
Alla Shustervich (Moira Kelly), a young woman who is reluctantly 
attracted to the lonely killer. </P>
<P>     LITTLE ODESSA is an extremely complex motion picture, layered with 
powerful themes and fascinating characters.  The dysfunctional family 
dynamic is examined from a different perspective--this is a case of 
the best intentions gone awry.  The film's ending has a strong 
allegorical, as well as dramatic, impact.  Not only is the final 
sequence emotionally crushing, but it slams home a vivid and telling 
message about prices paid by both the innocent and the guilty for crimes 
within the community.  And the consignment of a Jewish body to an oven 
calls to mind a chilling association. </P>
<P>     At the opening of LITTLE ODESSA, Josh is in a hell of his own 
making.  During the course of the film, there are opportunities for 
redemption and love, all of which are rejected.  Josh has no emotional 
capacity; when he makes love to Alla, the act is passionless and 
mechanical.  He is unable to respond to his brother's simple offer of 
devotion.  He cannot cry when he faces his dying mother.  Only his 
father provokes a reaction, and that is a decidedly negative one.  By 
this performance, Tim Roth adds yet another impressive credit to his 
resume.  </P>
<P>     Equally as complex is Josh's tormented, self-pitying father--a 
man who has lost all authority over his household and his existence.  
Assimilation to the American way of life is a continuing struggle for 
someone like him, born and raised on traditions and values that his 
children don't share.  Arkady loathes Josh as much as he hates himself.  
He has a mistress, but feels guilty about not being with his dying life.  
He is educated, yet is forced by economic circumstances to run a 
newsstand.  He loves Reuben, yet his actions seem always to hurt his 
younger son.  Maximilian Schell, an accomplished actor who hasn't had 
much screen exposure in the past few years, encourages in viewers a 
mixture of resentment and sympathy. </P>
<P>     Moira Kelly, despite the most limited screen time of a member of 
the primary cast, turns in one of the best performances of her career.  
Her confusion, self-doubt, and conflicting feelings for Josh, as well as 
her recognition that the relationship is doomed, add a subdued poignancy 
to Alla that less skillful acting would not have conveyed.  Edward 
Furlong, a young actor gaining presence with each new role, somewhat 
underplays Reuben, but not to the point where it interferes with the 
story.  Vanessa Redgrave does her usual fine job. </P>
<P>     The violence of LITTLE ODESSA is brutal, quick, and always 
shocking.  As in SCHINDLER'S LIST, scenes of bloodshed are presented 
graphically, but never gratuitously.  The deaths in this film, when they 
occur, cause a momentary contraction of the viewer's stomach muscles.  
This is a credit to the director, who has a clear vision and uses all 
the tools at his disposal to attain those ends. </P>
<P>     Because of the richness of the subject matter and the complexity of 
the characters, gangster movies, especially those with strong ethnic 
overtones, make excellent vehicles for social commentary.  LITTLE ODESSA 
is the latest example of what such a film can accomplish.  With an 
emotional impact as strong as its intellectual appeal, LITTLE ODESSA is 
deserving of a far better fate than the one Fine Line Features has 
consigned it to.   </P>
