<P>     UNZIPPED is a cinematic portrait of Isaac Mizrahi, an artist whose
palette is fabric.  Ostensibly, the film is a documentary, but use of that
term requires stretching its meaning.  Many scenes appear staged, and a
great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room.  The
cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium,
and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera (especially would-be
actresses like Cindy Crawford).  Director Douglas Keeve (who was Mizrahi's
lover at the time) freely admits that he "couldn't care less about the
truth" but was more interested in capturing "the spirit and love in Isaac
and in fashion."</P>
<P>     Despite violating nearly every rule of "legitimate" documentary film
making, however, UNZIPPED is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment.
While it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the
fashion industry, it presents a fascinating, if incomplete, picture of
designer Mizrahi.  This man is the perfect subject for this kind of study --
he's funny, energetic, and eminently quotable.  He has unusual views on just
about everything, from fashion ("It's about women not wanting to look like
cows") to Mary Tyler Moore ("Between her and Jackie Kennedy, they shaped
this country") to style ("It's almost impossible to have style nowadays
without the right dogs").</P>
<P>     UNZIPPED also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which
Mizrahi turns an idea into a dress.  It's almost certainly different that
anyone would imagine.  The designer draws on a variety of sources for his
look, including NANOOK OF THE NORTH and old Bette Davis movies, then enlists
the aid of a Ouija board to help form the collection.  In particular,
UNZIPPED traces Mizrahi's development of his Fall 1994 line from its
inception in the Spring to the final fashion show, which highlights a number
of prominent models, including Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Kate Bush,
and Linda Evangelista.</P>
<P>     On the technical side, a number of interesting choices were made in
filming UNZIPPED.  A variety of film stocks were used: Super 8, 16 mm
black-and-white, and 35 mm color.  There is a purpose to this beyond simple
artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie, and,
during the climactic fashion show, color is used to show the audience's
perspective, while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences.
Nevertheless, some viewers will be put off by this treatment.</P>
<P>     While UNZIPPED isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se, Keeve
has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame
Robert Altman was with READY TO WEAR.  Overall, however, this movie is far
more about Mizrahi than anything else, and only when viewed from that
perspective does UNZIPPED succeed.  When the designer declares that
"everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and
liberating," it fits perfectly with the image of him that UNZIPPED has
constructed.</P>
