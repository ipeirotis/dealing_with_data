<P>     To me, the idea of a sequel to THE FUGITIVE always seemed like a 
bad idea.  True, Sam Girard (Tommy Lee Jones) was a more interesting 
character than Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford), but could he carry a 
movie on his own?  Sadly, we'll never really know, because the Girard of 
U.S. MARSHALS bears only a token resemblance to the character who 
doggedly pursued Kimball in THE FUGITIVE.  As re-invented here, Girard 
is a generic action hero; most of the quirks that made him interesting 
(and that earned Jones an Oscar) are absent.  With a few minor re-
writes, John McClane from the DIE HARD movies could have been plugged 
into this role.</P>
<P>     The script tries to recapture the energy of THE FUGITIVE by re-
cycling various plot elements.  As in the original, Girard is pursuing 
an innocent man, and he suspects that there's more to the case than 
meets the eye.  There's a big accident that allows the prisoner to go 
free (this time, it involves a plane and the side of a mountain, not a 
bus and a train), a subsequent manhunt, and several lengthy chase 
sequences.  For a little variety, the conspiracy in U.S. MARSHALS 
implicates officials of the U.S. government, not a one-armed man and 
doctors.</P>
<P>     This time around, the wrongly-accused man is a suspected murderer 
named Sheridan (Wesley Snipes).  Supposedly, he killed two federal 
agents, but someone wants him dead before his case ends up in court.  A 
murder attempt on the airplane transporting him to prison goes wrong, 
and the plane crash lands.  During the ensuing confusion, Sheridan gets 
away.  Soon, U.S. Marshal Sam Girard and his faithful team are on the 
job, setting up roadblocks and closing off the perimeter.  The Feds, 
wanting to be kept informed of the manhunt's progress, force Girard to 
add another member to his team -- slick, self-confident John Royce 
(Robert Downey Jr.).  And the chase is on.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, it's not just one chase -- it's one after another 
after another.  The repetitiveness quickly grows tiresome, and the movie 
ends up lasting at least thirty minutes too long.  The bloated running 
length has nothing to do with extra time needed to unravel the 
needlessly convoluted plot.  It simply offers an opportunity for the 
characters to do a lot more running around before the final, inevitable 
confrontation between Girard, Sheridan, and a traitor (whose identity, 
despite being easy to guess, shall remain unrevealed here).</P>
<P>     Tommy Lee Jones, who turned in a delicious performance as Girard in 
THE FUGITIVE, is (like the screenplay) on auto-pilot here.  He's a 52 
year old action hero who runs, climbs, shoots, and swims, all without 
getting a hair out of place.  Snipes' Sheridan appears to have undergone 
a personality extraction -- there's nothing deeper than the bare-bones 
"innocent guy on the run."  Most of the supporting characters are 
equally faceless, with the exception of Joe Pantoliano's Cosmo, who acts 
like he drinks too much coffee.  Swiss actress Irene Jacob, the dark-
haired beauty from Kieslowski's RED, represents the classic case of 
talent being wasted.  She plays Sheridan's girlfriend.</P>
<P>     While I enjoyed THE FUGITIVE, I wasn't the film's biggest booster.  
I thought the coincidence-laden plot was poorly constructed.  But the 
action sequences were often nail-biters, the lead characters were well-
developed, and the dialogue was intelligent.  U.S. MARSHALS exhibits 
many of THE FUGITIVE's faults with few of its strengths.  As a result, 
this movie is a routine exercise in stunt choreography, with more 
valleys than peaks, and not enough tension to keep the viewer engaged 
for the full 143-minute length.  U.S. MARSHALS is workmanlike, and that 
makes it, at best, a marginal choice for theatrical viewing.</P>
