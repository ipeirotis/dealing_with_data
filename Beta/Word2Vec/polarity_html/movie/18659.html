<P>     There was a sense of deja-vu developing long before I actually saw
INSTINCT, inspired by the presentation of the basic premise in the
trailers.  Here was Anthony Hopkins, playing a brilliant scientist turned
hair-trigger madman, turning the tables on a confident young interviewer
trying to get inside his head...I couldn't help but think I'd seen this
somewhere before.  Then I saw the film, and it all became clear.  This
wasn't just a case of Hopkins flexing his Hannibal Lecter muscles again
before taking on the film version of Thomas Harris' recently-published
sequel to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  He was simply keeping pace with a
story that slaps together characters, situations and exact shots from
dozens of other films.</P>
<P>     INSTINCT is a sloppy, derivative drama focusing on the interaction
between primatologist Dr. Ethan Powell (Hopkins) and psychiatric resident
Dr. Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.).  Powell, a once-noted expert on
gorillas, is now a mute inmate in a prison psychiatric ward after
murdering two men in the jungle of Rwanda; Caulder, an ambitious
up-and-comer, sees interviewing Powell for a compentency evaluation as his
ticket to professional stardom.  Powell eventually does open up to
Caulder, but only because he has a message to relate.  In flashback we see
Powell becoming ever more connected to the family of gorillas he is
studying until he is accepted as one of them.  His experience leads him to
a realization about the nature of human behavior in the world, a lesson he
intends to impart on his impromptu pupil Caulder.</P>
<P>     You could spend a productive day doing little more than ticking off
the films from which INSTINCT cribs:  ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST,
GORILLAS IN THE MIST, TARZAN, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and even DEAD POETS
SOCIETY in addition to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Gerald DiPego's script
plods along, dropping its familiar cinematic tropes like bread crumbs
leading the audience to its responses.  There's the psychiatrist who's
really more confused than his patient, the prison guard (John Ashton)
whose casual sadism is treated as a bona fide job requirement, and the
collection of mental patients who become lovable comic relief.  There's
even a scene of confounding idiocy in which we, the knee-jerking audience,
are supposed to cheer for Caulder irresponsibly whipping a room full of
jailed psychotics into a rebellious frenzy.  INSTINCT is so gruellingly
predictable that you may be surprised momentarily when Powell's daughter
(Maura Tierney) doesn't become a love interest for Caulder, until you
realize that this is just a slightly different, more insulting cliche:  a
black man and a white woman are allowed to be "just friends."</P>
<P>     Somehow, in the midst of so much uninspired tripe, Anthony Hopkins
still manages to come through with a performance that's invigorating to
watch.  Sure, it's a spin on Hannibal Lecter, but it's more fiercely
intelligent than anything the rest of the film can deliver.  You can't
help but lean forward when you hear that seductive baritone; you can't
help but shudder when Caulder's neck hinges on the correct answer to a
very tricky question.  Hopkins makes INSTINCT better.  He also makes it
worse, because everything else looks even more workmanlike, notably
Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance.  Gooding is all facial twitches and
exposition explaining the tremendous change in his life wrought by Powell.
A little economy and subtlety -- skills Hopkins demonstrates even when
playing a wild man -- could have served Gooding well.</P>
<P>     Sadly, subtlety is one thing INSTINCT has in very short supply.  Even
viewers prepared to sympathize with the film's fuzzy embrace of the state
of nature will find this more a philosophical tract (albeit one with
remarkably realistic animatronic apes by Stan Winston) than a compelling
drama.  We all know man bad/animals good, which makes the decision to turn
the humans into cartoonish villains even more perplexing.  If there were a
moment of real insight into a character, the rest of INSTINCT's brainless
cinematic thievery might have been more tolerable.  Instead, it lets
breathing plot devices gab at one another for two hours between
unnervingly familiar situations.  Thank heavens for the entertainment
value of Anthony Hopkins' gloss on film's best-known cannibal.  It's only
fitting in a film that does plenty of cannibalizing of its own.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Hannibal lectures:  4.</PRE>
