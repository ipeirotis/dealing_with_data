DINNER GAME, THE (Dîner de cons, Le) (director/writer: Francis Veber;

Villeret (Francois Pignon), Thierry Lhermitte (Pierre Brochant), Francis

<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Francis Veber writes farcical plays which are then made into popular
films. The Dinner Game is such a scenario. The plot is about a bunch of
wealthy intellectual snobs who get pleasure from having a dinner for
idiots every week, where each guest finds someone he thinks is the
supreme idiot and brings him to dinner without the idiot knowing the
dinner's purpose.</P>
<P>Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte) is the snooty Parisian book
publisher, a calculating smoothie, someone who derives great pleasure
from these dinners, where the hosts relish in their guests lack of
sophistication and when they leave they have a good laugh over it,
choosing the one they think is the biggest idiot for the evening. He
thinks he has come up with the best idiot of all time in someone he met
on the train, whose hobby is putting matchsticks together of famous
Paris structures, Francois Pignon (Jacques Villeret). Francois knows how
many matchsticks goes into every bridge and tower he creates. The lowly
bureaucrat in the finance department is lured to the dinner when Pierre
tells him he might get a book published about his hobby.</P>
<P>Most of the film will take place in Pierre's luxurious apartment, as
Pierre invites his rotund and loquacious guest over to his house before
they go to dinner, telling his guest that this will give them a chance
to get acquainted. But just before the dinner, the writer pulls his back
out of place and is not up to attending the dinner, which leaves him
stuck in his apartment with the idiot. He also has a tiff with his very
attractive wife Christine (Vandernoot), who walks out on him, saying
that she has had enough of his mean-spirited attitude towards others.</P>
<P>Some might find this fast-moving play to be smart and witty. But I
didn't. The joke here, is that Pignon turns the tables on the rich snob
and makes his life a mess, as he remains in the apartment and tries to
help his new friend Pierre get Christine back. He does that mainly
through phone conversations, whereby he has a knack for saying the wrong
thing and making things worst. What results is a series of foul-ups
between Pierre's wife, his mistress (Frot), a taxman (Prevost) who says
he will audit him, and Pierre's wife finally being more upset with him
than before.</P>
<P>Jacques Villeret is an appealing fool, whose good-heart shines
throughout the farce, even though he proves to be a true numbskull.
While Thierry Lhermitte is in fine form as the  handsome but deeply
troubled man. There were a few laughs to be had, but this is really TV
sitcom material and not great wit.</P>
