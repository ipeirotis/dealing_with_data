<P>     CITIZEN RUTH is not coming soon to a theater near you.  If you live
in one of the half-dozen or so cities where Miramax gave the film a trial
run, you missed it months ago; if you don't live in one of those cities,
you never even got the chance to miss it.  No one markets unconventional
or controversial films better than Miramax, but even they couldn't get
more than a handful of people into theaters to see CITIZEN RUTH.  This
time, they were dealing with the Grand Poobah of unconventional,
controversial subjects.  You see, CITIZEN RUTH is about abortion.  No,
wait, it gets worse -- CITIZEN RUTH is a _comedy_ about abortion.  It sets
out to offend nearly everyone, and succeeds.  It's got an unrepentant
loser as its protagonist, and she's the most likeable character in the
film.  In short, CITIZEN RUTH has absolutely everything working against it
except a blisteringly funny script, assured direction and a remarkably
brave lead performance by Laura Dern.</P>
<P>     Dern plays Ruth Stoops, a young woman with no home, no job and a
penchant for sniffing anything that comes in a can or a tube.  Ruth is
already a four-time loser as a mother when she learns after her 17th 
arrest for inhalation of dangerous substances that she is pregnant.  The
judge (David Graf) threatens Ruth with a felony charge for endangerment of
her fetus, but suggests that he might reconsider if she were to get an
abortion.  That suggestion outrages local right-to-life leaders Norm
(Kurtwood Smith) and Gail Stoney (Mary Kay Place), who take Ruth into
their home and try to turn her case into a media event.  Of course the
other side isn't about to sit still for such tactics, eventually snaring
Ruth away from the Stoneys to make their own political statement.  Stuck
in the middle is Ruth herself, who seems to have more control over
procuring her next high than over the fate of her pregnancy.</P>
<P>     If you were inclined to keep a tally, you'd probably find that
Alexander Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor don't split their mockery evenly
down the middle.  They take some savage shots at the Baby Savers' tactics,
including a hilarious scene at a "clinic" where Ruth receives "counseling"
about her "choice."  Norm, meanwhile, is portrayed as an ineffectual
horn-dog who ogles Ruth in a bathroom and uses his job as a hardware
store clerk to proselytize.  That doesn't mean the pro-choice advocates
get off easy.  They are portrayed as just as obsessed with "messages" and
public relations, and just as star-struck by their national leader.  It's
also hard not to chuckle at the terribly earnest paean one lesbian couple
sings to the "moon mother."</P>
<P>     There is only one place where the film-makers' sympathies obviously
lie, and that is with Ruth.  You may have a hard time sharing that
sympathy, however, because Laura Dern isn't interested in making you like
Ruth.  Ruth is a selfish manipulator, always ready to swear that she's
going to turn her life around a moment before she grabs a full bottle of
chianti and an empty bottle of toilet cleanser.  It is a gutsy and
brilliant performance, one on which the success of CITIZEN RUTH as a
social satire depends.  If Ruth Stoops is turned into one of the
sanctified poor, the film collapses under the weight of its sincerity.
Instead, she is made completely oblivious to anything but her own
immediate needs.  She is a walking worst-case scenario, which makes it
easy for both sides to use her as an example.  It also makes it impossible
for either side to control her, making for some of the funniest film
moments of the year.</P>
<P>     Payne's most extraordinary accomplishment may be satirizing both
sides of a serious issue while never understating the seriousness of the
issue itself.  In fact, CITIZEN RUTH is really about how this particular
battle has taken on a life of its own apart from the people affected by
it.  There is a scene at a protest early in the film where a clinic
employee chides protesters' behavior with a reminder that they "know the
drill."  It is a telling moment.  At some point, Ruth Stoops' case becomes
just another drill, another "war story" like the one a protester tells as
he gathers with colleagues as though in a social club.  Near the climax of
the film Ruth tries to escape from both sides, and is shocked to discover
that she can walk away virtually unnoticed; everyone is too busy shouting
to pay attention to a single troubled woman.  It's a shame that a
subversively spectacular film like CITIZEN RUTH managed to walk away just
as unnoticed.  </P>
