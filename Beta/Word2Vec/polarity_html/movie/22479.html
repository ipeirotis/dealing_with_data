<P>If this keeps up, Jane Austen (SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, PRIDE AND
PREJUDICE) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the Screen
Writers Guild.  Yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the
silver screen.  MANSFIELD PARK is a turn of the century (18th century
going on 19th) story about love among the classes as well as an
examination into proper society and family ties.</P>
<P>Ten year old Fanny Price (Hannah Taylor-Gordon, JAKOB THE LIAR), taken
from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell, is sent to
live with her aunt and the privileged class at Mansfield Park, under the
stern patriarchal hand of her uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter,
MOJO)</P>
<P>Spending her days reminded of her lower status, she also invents and
writes fanciful stories during her private times.   Fanny eventually grows
to become a beautiful, intelligent, and engaging heroine (quite unlike the
original character which Ms. Austen originally penned in her novel.)</P>
<P>Writer/director Patricia Rozema (WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING) is responsible
for the textual changes.  From a purely dramatic perspective, the revision
makes perfect sense and improves the film's audience appeal.  What Ms.
Rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of Ms. Austen's
own personality by including excerpts from the author's journals, giving
that dialogue to Fanny.</P>
<P>The result is a central character that is immediately appealing.  As the
grown Fanny, Australian actress Frances O'Connor (ALL ABOUT ADAM) does
wonderfully textured work.  At times, Ms. Rozema has Fanny address the
camera directly to communicate many of the novel's more introspective
observations.  This is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period
film and it is to Ms. O'Connor's credit that it works as well as it does.</P>
<P>The central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one... Whether
it is better to marry for love or for social standing?  Fanny has fallen
in love with her cousin Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller, PLUNKETT & MACLEANE) who
appears fond of her as well.  His attentions are soon divided as the
stylish and socially acceptable Mary Crawford (Embeth Davidtz,
BICENTENNIAL MAN) enters the picture along with her equally acceptable
brother Henry (Alessandro Nivola, INVENTING THE ABBOTTS) who eventually
sets his romantic sights upon Fanny.</P>
<P>While Mary and Henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections,
their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the
necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film's appropriately
Austen-like ending.</P>
<P>Other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the
source of the wealth of Mansfield Park... the slave trade.  There is also
a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and
is soon forgotten.</P>
<P>The motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust.  Fanny's
cousin, Maria Bertram (Victoria Hamilton, PERSUASION) is an example of one
making a poor match, marrying a well-to-do fool who is able to make her
comfortable, but never happy.  Fanny's own mother, trapped in her chosen
life of squalor warns Fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the
fact that she "married for love."</P>
<P>  Fanny, given those two terrible examples, and faced with the same
choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean.</P>
<P>The spiritual answer, of course, lies in the middle of those two
extremes.  Marriage is not a cold, calculating decision based upon
self-preservation.  Neither is it a senseless decision made in the warm
afterglow of a passionate embrace.</P>
<P>In the purest sense, marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people
agree to function as one.</P>
<P>"And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall
cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?" Matthew 19:5 [KJV]</P>
<P>Love and logic can be combined.  God's Word contains both.  So does a
marriage based upon His truth.</P>
