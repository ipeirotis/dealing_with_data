<P>     As the opening minutes of 'TIL THERE WAS YOU unfolded, I was fully
prepared to despise it for continuing the SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE-ization of
the romantic comedy genre.  The success of Nora Ephron's 1993 paean to
celestially-destined love may be the worst thing ever to happen to film
romance -- what incentive is there to create a plot or characters which
make sense if you can explain everything away as "fate?"  Then it became
clear that 'TIL THERE WAS YOU wasn't falling into the SLEEPLESS trap.  In
fact, it was consciously subverting it.  And suddenly I was even more
depressed that the film I was watching was so painfully tedious.  Here was
the love story I had been waiting for, and it turned out to be an
uninvolving, maudlin and incoherent mess.</P>
<P>     'TIL THERE WAS YOU follows the parallel lives of two Los Angeles
residents whose lives paths first cross when they are children, and whose
lives continue to affect each other's through the years though they never
actually have met.  Gwen Moss (Jeanne Tripplehorn) is a professional ghost
writer raised on romanticized notions of meeting your soul-mate; Nick
Dawkan (Dylan McDermott) is an architect whose unstable childhood has led
him to a series of ill-fated affairs.  Their lives become truly
intertwined when Gwen signs on to ghost-write the biography of Francesca
Lansfield (Sarah Jessica Paker), a former child star who subsequently
begins a romantic relationship with Nick.  Nick's firm is also involved in
the planned demolition of Gwen's apartment building, and Gwen's
impassioned opposition begins a process which could eventually bring them
together.</P>
<P>     I'm sure that director Scott Winant and writer Winnie Holzman thought
they were on to something fairly clever when they came up to the concept
for 'TIL THERE WAS YOU, and in theory they were right.  The story of Gwen
and Nick isn't a story about people destined to be together, though the
structure toys with that notion as they repeatedly just miss meeting each
other.  This is the story of two people who still have a lot of growing up
to do when we first meet them -- Gwen is a passive idealist in search of
her own voice, and Nick is incapable of investing himself in anything for
the long haul.  What we watch over the course of twenty years of their
lives are the events which shape them into people who could live happily
ever after.  It's a wonderfully practical kind of romanticism 'TIL THERE
WAS YOU offers:  the idea that true love is the product of two people who
meet at a moment when they are both _ready_ for true love.</P>
<P>     That's the sturdy skeleton of the story, however, not the dead body
of a film which was made with it.  Winant and Holzman are both alums of
"thirtysomething" and "My So-Called Life," shows as beloved for their
detailed characterizations as they were loathed for self-involved
emotionalism.  'TIL THERE WAS YOU is all the things the detractors of
those shows most detested, without nearly enough of the balancing wit and
attention to detail which gave the shows such a devoted following.
Holzman gets some comic mileage out of Gwen's losing battle with the
eccentric design of a trendy restaurant (created by Nick, of course), but
that's one of the few effective comic situations in the film.  The two
hours of 'TIL THERE WAS YOU could inspire a lot of watch-checking as it
becomes a rambling parade of over-wrought situations and annoying
characters, with Gwen's picturesque apartment complex -- a cross between
Melrose Place and the Garden District where it is perpetually raining rose
petals -- becoming more of a recurring joke than a location.</P>
<P>     The fatal flaw comes with the casting of the romantic leads, and for
once the problem isn't that they don't belong together.  You're just not
likely to care one way or the other.  Jeanne Tripplehorn demonstrates a
nice flair for light comedy, but the pleasant-if-kooky character she plays
isn't nearly interesting enough to support the story.  That goes double
for Dylan McDermott's Nick, who is as difficult to watch as he is to be
involved with.  Nick is a complete blank for most of the film, and his
sudden conversion from sullen architectural Dadaist to lover of all things
poetic and ornate makes virtually no sense.  Thank heaven Sarah Jessica
Parker is on hand as the endearingly narcissistic Francesca, providing a
burst of energy whenever she's in a scene.  'TIL THERE WAS YOU needs much
more of that energy to match its good intentions, instead of 110 minutes
of nearly oppressive sincerity.  The struggles of real-life relationships
don't have to be this dreary, but when they are, the appeal of starry-eyed
hokum like SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE suddenly makes a lot more sense.</P>
