(Dop), Byron Lord (Colonel Page), "Bubbles" Cash (Stripteaser), Cal
Duggan (Martian), Anthony Houston (Martian), 1966)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Larry Buchanan has created this cheapie AIP color film that has a great
title, a dismal story and hammy acting worthy of an amateur thespian
production. It's the kind of film played out in a serious manner, that
you couldn't help either enjoying or hating it for its awkwardness and
how bad it was. My caveat is: if you don't take this film seriously, you
are more than likely to have a better reaction to it than those who do.</P>
<P>The film has two featured stars: Tommy Kirk as Dop, the serious, droll
Martian scientist leader, here on a mission to bring back to Mars some
American women for purposes of fertilization; and, Yvonne Craig as Dr.
Marjorie Bolen, a gritty, Pulitizer prize-winning scientific expert on
Martian genetics. Tommy was a former member of Disney's Mouse Club and
was in "The Shaggy Dog." Yvonne was a former dancer, blessed  with
wonderful gams, and she was TV's Batgirl. Neither performer was ever
known for their acting skills.</P>
<P>A message is received from outer space by America's security system:
Mars needs women. Colonel Page (Byron) is the one-dimensional dullard in
charge of the security system and when the equally dull Martian Dop
suddenly appears at the control center and tells the colonel and the
reporter present, that because of a genetic flaw there is a hundred to
one ratio of males to females in Mars, and that 5 Martians are on a
mission to voluntarily bring back 5 females for purposes of reproducing
more females; and, they offer promises that everything will be done in a
non-violent manner, with the cooperation of the girls; and, so the
gauntlet is dropped. But the colonel refuses to abet the Martians in
this enterprise, as Dop disappears but not before mentioning that the
mission will go on whether or not the U.S. cooperates.</P>
<P>The Martians thusly become the world's first common enemy. They have
landed in an abandoned chemical dump somewhere around one of Texas' main
cities, and have neutralized all radar systems and dishes used for
detection. Dop warns his other medical missionaries, that they have 24
hours to complete their mission, so they will have to resort to using
hypnosis on their subjects. They are told to not eat the Earth food and
to spread out, borrowing suits from a closed clothing store, and
currency and city maps from a filling station, and cars from the airport
parking lot, picking that spot because the cars shouldn't be missed in
the short-run, and will be returned when they depart. The Martians
observe that ties are worn here, something they discarded in Mars
50-years ago as something useless. That's about as deep a jab at
political satire this film takes.</P>
<P>The five women chosen as perfect female specimens by the super-polite
abductors are all good lookers, who range from being a stripteaser, an
airline stewardess, a college "Homecoming Queen," an artist, and Dr.
Bolen. The longest and most drawn out abduction, is with Dop romancing
an all-too-willing Dr. Bolen, and we get to watch the two fall in love
while they visit the planetarium. It was delightful to see them hold
hands and in the end have him decide whether his love for her will cause
him to disobey his mission, as he must decide whether to return to Mars
or jump ship. Love is something that has gone out of vogue in Mars for
the last 100- years, but our hero says, this is what it must feel like.
She never realized he was a Martian, which shows you that even experts
on Mars could be fooled. The suspense for the conclusion is
breathtaking, as the Martians have to abort their mission with the U.S.
army on their tails, and there are genuine tears falling from Dr. Bolen!</P>
<P>Arguably, the film's best scene is when the Martians need a room in the
Texas hotel that is booked solid and they get the room and the
occupant's press credentials by hypnotizing the Seattle-Sun reporter in
it, as he looks at the reflecting lights in the pool and thereby is
convinced to go home.</P>
<P>What goes for special effects, are scenes where women are disappearing
and aliens are
appearing out of thin air. What goes for a Martian wardrobe, are
scuba-diving space suits and on their ears hockey pucks are worn from
which a vertical, foot-long antenna protrudes.</P>
<P>If you are in the mood for something to see that is inane, a film that
Edward Wood Jr. would be proud of, but in the hands of an Edgar Ullmer,
could have been much more notable, then this one could hit your funny
bone. In any case, I was in a silly mood when I saw it and was not
disappointed, it was as bad as I thought it would be; and, I thoroughly
enjoyed it.</P>
