<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Cy Endfield (Try and Get Me!), the overlooked blacklisted American
director who emigrated to England in the 1950s, has created a
no-nonsense epic masterpiece, one that is historically accurate, about a
heroic battle in British history. It is visually the best of such films
made, a classic study in heroism and in military planning, that stays
with the men in battle as they fight for survival and doesn't go off
into the politics of why they are there.</P>
<P>Richard Burton is the narrator who describes on that infamous day in
January 22, 1897,
how 4,000 Zulus in Natal, South Africa, attacked a British regiment for
no apparent reason
and killed all 1,500 men. What followed was another attack on 105
British troops, a company of mostly Welshmen, stationed nearby at
Rorke's Drift. The ensuing battle that lasted all day and night is told
from the British viewpoint.</P>
<P>"Zulu" opens with Swedish missionaries, Reverend Otto Witt (Hawkins) and
his daughter Margareta (Ulla), at a mass wedding of warriors, as the
guests of a Zulu chieftain, who is a parishioner of Witt's church. A
Zulu messenger arrives to tell of the massacre of British troops and the
taking of their rifles. The Witts flee in their carriage to warn the men
stationed at the Rorke's Drift outpost of the impending danger, urging
them to flee in the name of a peaceful God.</P>
<P>Lieutenant John Chad (Baker) is an engineer from the decimated regiment
who has been assigned to build a bridge at Rorke's Drift, and thereby
misses getting killed.The aristocratic company commander at Rorke's
Drift, Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Caine-his first major role in a
film), returns from hunting, when news of the impending attack reaches
the camp. Chad, by a matter of a few months seniority, assumes rank and
takes charge of the operation, to the chagrin of Bromhead who comes from
a long line of British officers who are used to positions of command.
Chad, after consulting with a knowledgeable Boer adviser who knows the
war methods of the Zulus, decides not to flee to the hills as Bromhead
wanted, but forms a barricade to ward off the frontal attack. As he
understands it, the Zulus will try to lure them out in their initial
attack and then will attack them from their vulnerable sides. The aim
will be to hold the outside perimeter at all times and reinforce any
side that is being attacked.</P>
<P>The side dramas that develop, at first, center around the annoying
missionary figure and his self-righteous daughter, as they try to stop
the men from fighting. He becomes such a disruptive influence, getting
all the black levee soldiers from the company to flee in the name of
God, that he has to be locked up. Later on, while in confinement he
finds a bottle of liquor and gets drunk, ranting at the men that they
will all die. Chad puts him and his daughter in their carriage and sends
them away from here, ironically saying that his parishioners won't kill
them.</P>
<P>The other side story centers around a thief who had to join the army or
go would have gone to jail, the rogue Henry Hook (James Booth), who is a
lighthearted malingerer, not giving one darn about soldiering. He is in
the hospital with a number of other men who are not fit for battle duty
due to wounds or sickness, but are not malingerers like Hook. Hook will
in battle emerge from his selfish ways and prove to be a brave soldier.</P>
<P>Endfield shows the wide differences of opinion held by the men about why
they are fighting: the duty bound Colour Sergeant Fred Bourne (Nigel
Green) says he is prepared to do whatever it takes and is pictured as a
tower of strength; a Welshman who enjoys singing, Private Owen (Ivor
Emmanuel), wonders what he is doing here; the mass of  soldiers are
frightened young men, who wonder why it is them who must fight; and, the
dedicated surgeon (Magee) who works selflessly to tend to the wounded,
just does what he has to do.</P>
<P>The Zulus are first heard coming as the ground shakes and it feels like
a train is chugging along, which presented a magnificent sight to behold
as they first appear on the hilltops and go through their ritual war
dance and chants. The Zulus sent their first wave out to get killed,
just so they can count the enemies firepower. They will then attack in
wave after wave, as the film becomes a masterfully done re-creation of
battle scene after battle scene. The tension is constantly being built
up and the men show how they handle themselves in battle, even when
exhausted and feeling that their situation might be hopeless.</P>
<P>The battle scenes were memorable, the acting was first-class, the
director correctly offers
no explanation for the WHY of the battle as the action itself seems to
explain the absurdity of their situation. The professional soldiers say,
"We fight because we are here, there is no one else who will fight for
us." It is difficult to get it out of one's mind the power of the Zulu
attack scenes and the courage shown by the badly outnumbered men to hold
fast and fight. What is hinted at here, is the insanity of colonialism
and of the missionaries who came to Africa to force their culture down
the natives' throats. The film offers no explanation about the racial
nature of the conflict, as it is played mostly as a story of a courage
on both sides. The film does not display a racist attitude.</P>
<P>By the film's final battle the Zulu warriors return to the hilltops and
salute the British soldiers as fellow warriors, before they return to
their villages acknowledging defeat, with most of their men killed. As a
result of this battle, eleven men, the highest number of men since
Britain's most prestigious military medal, the Victoria Crosses, were
first given out, receive that honor. Burton announces that there have
been 1,344 such medal given out overall.</P>
<P>Chad and Bromhead worked well together despite their class differences,
with Chad showing a natural ability to think fast and act without
indecision. There is a certain fascination about this movie that makes
it a moving experience, especially in watching the Zulus perform under
Endfield's direction. The Zulus never even saw a movie before and it
wasn't until Endfield showed them a Gene Autry oater that they knew what
he was talking about and were able to go along with his directing. Zulu
is presented in such a tough-minded and matter-of-fact way, that it is
hard to argue against the way it was filmed. It was also an interesting
bit of casting by the co-producers Endfield and Baker, of having the
Cockney Caine play a stuffy upper class Englishman. But it worked; Caine
was just splendid, it is still one of his finest hours in film.</P>
