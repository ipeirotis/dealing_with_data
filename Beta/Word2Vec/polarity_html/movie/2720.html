<P>     In more ways than one, SUNDAY'S CHILDREN is about fathers and
sons.  Written by Ingmar Bergman and directed by his youngest son
Daniel, the film depicts Bergman's own childhood and his volatile
relationship with his father Henrik.  Here, the names of the past
generation have been changed, but the story that remains is heavily
autobiographical, and forms a trilogy with the elder Bergman's final
directorial effort, FANNY AND ALEXANDER and Billy August's searing and
powerful version of Bergman's screenplay, THE BEST INTENTIONS.</P>
<P>     Most of SUNDAY'S CHILDREN takes place in the 1920s and centers
around the disintegration of the family of young Pu (Henrik Linnros).
His father Erik (Thommy Berggren) and mother Karin (Lena Endre) are at
a crossroads in their marriage--she wants a separation; he won't hear
of it.  Pu's nearly-worshipful attitude towards his father leads Erik
to suggest that his son accompany him on a day-long journey to a
distant parish where Erik is to preach a Sunday sermon.  Pu agrees and,
on the way, experiences something that will soon become a painfully
recurring reality in his relationship with his father--violent,
explosive anger that leads to physical abuse.</P>
<P>     Erik Bergman is SUNDAY'S CHILDREN's representation of Henrik
Bergman.  Karin is Ingmar's mother Anna, and Pu is explicitly revealed
to be the author.  Despite name and actor changes, this is an excellent
followup to THE BEST INTENTIONS (which told the story of Henrik and
Anna's courtship and the early years of their marriage).  The material
is not as potent, but the continuation of the story arc is
unmistakable.</P>
<P>     There are four flash-forwards.  These take place in 1968, and show
a middle-aged Ingmar interacting with his dying father.  The scenes are
crucial to the plot, placing the main story in perspective and giving
emotional resonance to the 1920s sequences.  Knowing the eventual,
tragic path taken by the father/son relationship adds poignancy to the
presentation of circumstances before everything went wrong.  Aside from
the one instance of abuse, the ugliness that was to mark Ingmar's
lifelong war with his father had not yet begun.  And because we see
Erik as such a caring, sympathetic figure, it hurts to recognize what
he will become.</P>
<P>     Like most films scripted by Ingmar Bergman, SUNDAY'S CHILDREN
moves slowly, with the emotional and psychological pressures constantly
building.  This is not a movie for those who are unwilling to sit and
gradually become immersed in the unspectacular lives of a group of
characters.</P>
<P>     While not surpassing his father, Director Daniel Bergman has
managed to make the material his own by crafting a first-rate film.  He
is aided by a superlative cast which includes one of the most natural
under-ten actors to grace the screen in years (Henrik Linnros).  The
credibility of the film is linked inextricably to Pu, and young Linnros
makes his character consistently believable.</P>
<P>     There are numerous parallels between SUNDAY'S CHILDREN and another
currently-available Swedish film, THE SLINGSHOT.  Both take place in
the 1920s and are told from the point-of-view of a young boy.  As good
as THE SLINGSHOT is, however, it lacks a portion of the depth that
forms the foundation of SUNDAY'S CHILDREN.  Each film is worth seeing
in its own right, and various comparisons and contrasts will leap to
mind, but SUNDAY'S CHILDREN is the stronger of the two.  Ingmar
Bergman's days behind the camera may be over, but he apparently still
has a worthwhile story or two left to tell.</P>
