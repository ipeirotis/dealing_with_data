<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A rehashed formula action/sci-fi film about the near future that looks
old hat and plays like low-brow entertainment even as it advances the
sophisticated problems cloning might eventually hold. Maybe it's because
the film tried to be both preachy about its social conscience message
and at the same time your typical Arnold Schwarzenegger action film,
that it looked so confused, seeming as fuzzy and as unbelievable as the
instant cloning process it featured in the film. But, as for the film's
entertainment value, it passes the test for mild escapist fare, and to
the bargain you have two Arnold's saying lame one-liners for the price
of one. Arnold's comeback from health problems can be declared over but
it cannot hide the fact that he has aged and seems more weary and unsure
of himself now, not quite the super-hero he once was. But, even if this
film is not as good as his "Total Recall" or "True Lies"  or  even
"Terminator 2," it should be good enough to be accepted by his loyal
following. How it will do in the box office and with the general public,
is hard to say, as the film seems gloomily cluttered with nocturnal
shots and the action is less than spectacular, and it is not as stylish
as some other recent popular action films (eg. The Matrix). Arnold still
likes to do things the old-fashioned way, by knocking heads in times of
difficulty. And, how the public will respond to the aging Arnold saving
the world from an evil clone manufacturer who is merely a greedy
businessman and not a super-villain, in a PG-13 film without an edge, is
anyone's guess, especially since Arnold's popularity is slipping. In
this film he is asked to carry the load, though helped somewhat that the
film is well executed, has good enough special effects and a
semi-plausible cloning theme. But, he still cannot overcome the overall
mediocrity of the film.</P>
<P>Cloning is evil in this film mainly because it is used by a shady
biotech corporation head Mr. Drucker (Goldwyn), a slimy, reptilean
character, who by means of  illegal clonings has become the richest man
in the world. He is consumed with accumulating more wealth and with
getting politicians to change their vote to make cloning legal for
humans. It is now only legal to clone pets and to clone animals to
restock the food supply. It is banned for humans by a so-called
"6th-day" law.</P>
<P>For its thought provoking moments, the film wants to draw its
battlelines over good science vs. bad science, showing how Drucker's
corporation greedily makes money off science and profits greatly from
its illegal operation. Drucker states, he is only going forward to
territory where God left off. God, as a superior belief to science, is
thrown into the argument by Arnold, who plays the ordinary Joe,
suspicious of science and the new trends in the world. Philosophy is not
one of the film's strong points, as there is a muddled argument for each
position presented.</P>
<P>Dr. Graham Weir (Duvall) is a mad genius scientist that Drucker's
corporation financially backs to do its secret illegal clones. Weir is
someone who is in it for the knowledge and the love of his wife. She
died five years ago but is now cloned thanks to him, but is now dying of
cancer and refuses another clone. For him, there is nothing higher than
human love. He's the most interesting one in the film, so it behooves me
that he has a truncated part, which fails to give him the depth needed
to draw out his character and go further than the drab figure he is
portrayed as, being a good scientist used by an evil businessman.</P>
<P>The first example of cloning, comes in the film's opening scene, where a
star football player, on a team owned by Drucker, with a lifetime
contract of $300 million a season, is brain-dead after a football
injury. "We have a lifetime contract with a vegetable. Johnny--you're
gonna have to take one for the team." Marshall (Michael Rooker), one of
Drucker's henchmen says, before pulling the plug on Johnny's
life-support system. A cloned Johnny then reappears as a star
quarterback again. The joke being, that you don't have to die, the
corporation can clone you in no time at all (hardly believable), if they
have your genetic code, and the cost is a only mere one and a half
million bucks.</P>
<P>In the next scene, we see that Adam Gibson (Schwarzenegger) is a nice,
peaceful family man, living a normal suburban life with his doting wife
Natalie (Wendy Crewson) and his playful daughter. He's a charter
helicopter pilot who is partners with the free-wheeling, comical,
bachelor Hank (Michael Rapaport). Hank is, also, someone who has the
perfect girl via 'virtual reality.' They have been hired to airlift
Drucker to a skiing slope, and the only catch, and it turns out to be a
big catch, is that Hank and him have to undergo a special blood,
fingerprinting and eye test on Drucker's special machines. Drucker will
use this info gathered here later on for cloning purposes.</P>
<P>Adam's big problem at home comes when he learns that their daughter's
pet dog Oliver, a pet his daughter can't live without dies. The wife
wants the dog cloned at RePet? But this is against his religious
principles. He thinks there's something wrong about messing with the
natural order of life and death, because he's just an old-fashioned guy,
liking his 1950s Caddy over the modern automatic car that drives
itself.  He also endears himself to those old-fashioned family values of
how to raise a child and blames the media for showing too much graphic
violence. But, he seems to have a selective opinion on when to use
high-tech, because on his job, he seems to be all for high-tech, using a
remote control to fly one of his other helicopters.</P>
<P>Adam switches places with Hank and pilots Drucker by posing as Adam, so
he can go to a RePet store and see if he wants a cloned dog and to then
attend a surprise birthday party his wife is throwing for him. But a
fanatical anti-cloning fundamentalist (Colin Cunningham) executes the
pilot and Drucker. Thinking that Adam and Drucker died and nobody will
be the wiser, Weir clones them. When Adam peeks into his house at his
birthday party, there is another Adam in there blowing out the candles
on his birthday cake - one who looks just like him. He is then met by
the most persistent villains on Drucker's goon squad trying to eliminate
him (Sarah Wynter and Rodney Rowland). Their claim to fame is that they
keep getting killed by Arnold but keep coming back, unfortunately this
lengthens the film to over two hours with no apparent discernible
plusses in keeping the film going.</P>
<P>After seeing that his family has accepted the clone as him, the dazed
Adam is on the run from Drucker's goons and in search of the truth as to
what's going on, and has to put up with the knowledge that there are a
lot of clones around and that the one who looks like him is sleeping
with his wife. He also finds out, to his amazement, that even Drucker is
a clone.</P>
<P>The film lets go of its pseudo-science pretenses and turns back to
Arnold in the action-hero mode, of him getting revenge on those who dare
to mess with him and his family. It's all been seen before, but the film
seems easy to take or leave, and is only mildly offensive to both those
who like their films with a bit more intelligence and those who prefer a
lot more rough action. This film will live and die not by its story, but
by what you think of its action scenes. I thought they were good enough
in a functional sense, but there were just too many dead spots in the
story for me to find this big-budget film anything more than a minor
work.</P>
