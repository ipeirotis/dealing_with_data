<P>Let me open this one with a confession: I love cop movies. I adore them with 
such an unwavering, near foolish passion that I was actually one of the first 
in line to see 1998's ONE TOUGH COP starring the smirkiest of the Baldwin 
brothers, Steven. Was it any good? Well, just about as good as Baldwin's 
Steven Seagal impression (for those I've confused the answer is a resounding 
NO!). Now let me clarify, I don't love just any cop movie; I'm not too keen 
on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly 
(gulp) returning thanks to Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. I'm partial to those 
gritty, earthy cop dramas like SERPICO, DONNIE BRASCO, and THE FRENCH 
CONNECTION. Problem is these films come along just about as often as George 
W. Bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "true" cop movie does hit 
multiplexes, I come running towards it like an eager puppy…and inevitably I 
leave, head bowed, tripping over my squiggly tail.</P>
<P>So what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to 
shell out $7.50 for a movie called ONE TOUGH COP (which actually sounds a lot 
like a WISEGUY spin-off, no?)? Truth is I'm a sucker for those barren 
streets, that gritty, graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous 
criminals lurk and cops, like modern day knights, must shield us from their 
iniquitous clutches. Yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish, which, 
I'm guessing, is precisely where these feelings come from. As little tots us 
boys are brought up to create our own wars with GI JOE'S, enact cops and 
robbers or cowboy and Indian fantasies, etc. The best gritty cop films tap 
into those gleeful adolescent fantasies, and heighten them, turning it all 
into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos. As 
an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically; sure I can get a 
cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a Krzysztof Kieslowski film, 
but I still delight at the promise a "guy" film could potentially bring.</P>
<P>Now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones? Ooh that one really gets 
me going, these protectors using all that at their service, taking advantage 
of others for their own gain. Throw a courtroom drama (yech!) into the pot 
and you have the tremendously absorbing Sidney Lumet film PRINCE OF THE CITY. 
How absorbing is PRINCE OF THE CITY, you ask? So damn absorbing that when the 
film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama (a sub-genre 
I loath the way Kristy Swanson must loath Sarah Michelle Gellar) I remained 
completely and utterly involved.</P>
<P>The film stars Treat Williams, who gives the kind of performance that should 
have skyrocketed his career up to the level that Brad Pitt currently resides 
at. Since I was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of PRINCE OF 
THE CITY, I cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't. (Though judging 
from his recent roles in tripe like DEEP RISING and DEAD HEAT I would guess 
that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves). Like 
Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts (both of whom are currently doing time in 
direct to video purgatory) Williams is a talented leading man who didn't make 
it to where he should have. (If there was any justice in this dog gone world 
Keanu Reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell). Here, the 
actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from Al Pacino's in SERPICO 
(also directed by Lumet).</P>
<P>Williams plays Danny Ciello, a member of an elite squad of police officers 
who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-Juliani streets of New York. 
They work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes. And that 
analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into 
using corrupt means to get the job done. The squad relies entirely on 
informants (low level junkies) to gain access to the big wigs, and in order 
to obtain the info they seek, they sometimes have to provide the junkies with 
the junk of their choice. Danny has done this, and though he's a fairly 
honorable guy, who took the job in order to do good, his intentions have 
gotten a bit skewed along the way. He seeks redemption and concludes that the 
best way to go about getting it is by talking to Internal Affairs who then 
convince him to go undercover as a "double agent". He does so with one 
condition: He will not rat on his partners. Right away we know that that is 
exactly what he'll have to do. And watching the movie build to that is 
thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be.
Undercover cop films are almost innately exciting, even the kind that pull 
out all the cliches (like IN TOO DEEP). How can one not be moved by the 
issues of betrayal, ambiguity, and the danger in putting oneself in such a 
risky position? PRINCE OF THE CITY takes all this and charges it with a 
perceptive, hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro 
Sidney Lumet, as well as a handful of intense performances, most notably by 
Treat.</P>
<P>Lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back, and lets the 
camera soak up the action. His scenes transition rapidly from one to the next 
building layers of tension, and he rarely holds for reaction shots, instead 
he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking. Lumet's 
worst tendency is one that many film makers (especially Oliver Stone) tend to 
overuse: He relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at 
each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension. This isn't as much 
a problem here as it was in NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN, Lumet's most recent 
cop\lawyer endeavor, a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching.</P>
<P>Though of late Lumet has made several really awful career choices (maybe he 
and Treat should get together for a drink or something), the most recent a 
completely unnecessary remake of GLORIA, here he was ON, sustaining tension 
in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot.</P>
<P>Some of the formula pictures I like the best are the most simplistic. 
Hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even 
tolerable. Of course cop movies aren't popular anymore (yes buddy cop flicks 
are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the 
punch lines), but just look at the average Hollywood action movies, flicks so 
bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves 
no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn't 
gay, the lame comic relief character who's never funny, and on and on. </P>
<P>For all its moral ambiguities PRINCE OF THE CITY is a back to the basics 
cop\courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills. It 
focuses completely on its story, and its characters all of whom are 
completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies.
There's a great scene early on where an irate Williams shouts at an IA 
officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny BRAVEHEART 
inspirational speeches, but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and 
begins sobbing. This is a scene that would never make it into a Michael Bay 
film (even though Bruce Willis sacrifices his life at the end of ARMAGEDDON, 
not one damn tear) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that 
makes him too human, excuse me, weak. In the very next scene Danny speaks in 
a hushed raspiness, straining to get the words out. He's lost his voice. Does 
that little itty bitty detail matter? Maybe not to most, but it sure made my 
night. And in a sprawling epic of corruption, greed, betrayal and violence 
it's nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things.</P>
