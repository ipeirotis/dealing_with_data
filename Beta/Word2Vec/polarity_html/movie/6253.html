<P>     It is easy for me to understand the reasoning which pegged Shane
Black's script for THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT as worth $4 million, because it
includes all the elements which tend to make studio executives soil
themselves in anticipation.  A high concept premise, plenty of gratuitous
violence, a little T&A, buddies exchanging profane one-liners, really big
explosions...these are the stuff of blockbusters, my friends.  They are
also the stuff of inane, incoherent garbage, unlikely to gain any style
points with inane, incoherent garbagemeister Renny Harlin (CUTTHROAT
ISLAND) at the helm.  The thing is that THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT is a
difficult film to dismiss, because it is just as often entertaining as it
is actively infuriating.  As inane, incoherent garbage goes, it's really
not that bad.</P>
<P>     Geena Davis stars as Samantha Caine, a small town Pennsylvania
schoolteacher with a large hole in her life.  Eight years earlier she woke
up on a beach pregnant and with no recollection of her previous life, and
has since become a simple working mother while detectives failed to
provide any clues to her identity.  But Mitch Henessey (Samuel L. Jackson)
manages to succeed where others did not, and finds names which may help
fill in the blanks.  It turns out that Samantha might not like what she
finds, as she learns that she was a government-trained assassin named
Charley Baltimore, and that she has plenty of enemies who are not at all
pleased to find her alive.  She also has friends, but the trick is
figuring out who they are before someone erases her memory for good.</P>
<P>     Harlin tried to turn wife Geena Davis into an action heroine in
CUTTHROAT ISLAND, and the result was the biggest financial disaster in the
history of the cinema.  Apparently that was not enough to shake his
conviction that Davis had the right stuff, and THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT
sort of proves him right.  There is something strangely satisfying about
watching Davis turn into a killing machine, while partner Jackson (as the
down-on-his-luck gumshoe who usually does the ass-kicking in such films)
generally looks on ineffectually.  It's primitive role-reversal stuff, but
it works; it's a great bit of business when hausfrau Samantha takes a pie
she has just baked in a Pyrex dish and uses it to beat in the head of an
assailant.  Jackson also gets a handful of simplistic but very funny gag
lines, and even a line in which he makes fun of making up gag lines.  It
would be over-estimating the subtlety of THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT to refer
to it as a satire, but its bending of conventions often works quite well.</P>
<P>     At other times, it is about as conventional as action film-making
gets, and distressingly brutal.  There is a sequence early in the film
involving a deer hit by a car which will raise plenty of hackles, and it
provides an appropriate prelude to numerous scenes of torture, disturbing
fantasy/dream sequences and plenty of good old-fashioned shootings and
stabbings.  Harlin and Black also play unfair with the tired device of a
child in distress, and manage to play plenty of bodily functions for gags
along the way.  Into the middle of this rather crude mess they then drop
half-hearted attempts at character development, with Davis' discovery
resulting in a split personality and Jackson trying to redeem himself for
something or other.  For four million bucks, I suppose Shane Black figured
he might as well throw in the kitchen sink.</P>
<P>     Yet I can't deny that THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT made me laugh, and that
there was never a time when I was bored.  Yes, villains appear and
disappear with scarcely a thought to explaining who they are or why they
matter.  Yes, it is overloaded and overblown in a way which can make
anyone who cares about good movies cringe.  Yes, it is sometimes becomes
so violent as to be off-putting.  THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT is an
exploitation film, but it is an exploitation film with a sense of its own
absurdity.  You may not care at all about Mitch Henessey as a person, but
you will probably find yourself enjoying his exasperated delivery of
Black's crude humor; you may not really believe Charley Baltimore _is_ a
person, but you might still find her exploits a guilty pleasure.  THE LONG
KISS GOODNIGHT is an easy film to like, and equally easy to hate.  What
else can you say when you walk away from an inane, incoherent piece of
garbage with a smile on your face?</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 femme fatalities:  6.</PRE>
