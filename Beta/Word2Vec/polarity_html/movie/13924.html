<PRE>THE NEGOTIATOR</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>The police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job
of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal
out of doing whatever he or she intends to do.  Lives are often at
stake, and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally
unstable, prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice.  The
negotiator must therefore be something of an actor, psychologist, and
sham artist, in addition to being a police officer; he must be able to
think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the
confrontation without violence, or failing that, must be prepared to
facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower.  Most of
all, the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little
intelligence about the scenario as possible, and quickly gain control
of the situation, dominate the conversation, and influence the
perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he
really wants.  It takes a pretty smart person to do that.</P>
<P>But what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart?  What if
he's also able to think on his feet?  In fact, what if he also knows
all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor?  It is this
circumstance which forms the basis for F. Gary Gray's THE NEGOTIATOR.
In this film, police negotiator Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson) is
tipped off by his partner to corruption within the Chicago police
force.  When his partner turns up shot to death and Internal Affairs
finds incriminating evidence in Roman's home, Roman becomes the prime
suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder.
Faced with the scorn of most of the police department, and under close
scrutiny by the media, Roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of
those typical scenes in the captain's office.  I don't quite remember
if the captain actually said, "I hate to do this, but...", although it
wouldn't surprise me if he did.</P>
<P>Luckily, the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates
on the interesting premise mentioned above.  After being offered a
take-it-or-leave-it deal by the District Attorney, Roman resolves to
prove his innocence by walking into the office of Internal Affairs
Inspector Niebaum (J.T. Walsh), taking him and others hostage, and
proclaiming he has been framed.  Although Roman's actions seem forced
due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up, Gray
redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between Roman
and fellow police negotiator Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey) which soon
ensue.</P>
<P>Jackson, while a superb actor, is miscast in the role of Roman.  The
actor has become so popular, and so often identified as a protagonist
(notable exceptions can be found, such as in JACKIE BROWN), that we as
an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his
threats.  The script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is
only trying to prove his innocence.  How can we believe he's going to
shoot a hostage, no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier?
Unfortunately, this preconception saps the film of some of it's
would-be suspenseful moments, and anything good left in those scenes
is largely attributed to Jackson's acting ability.  Almost every time
he's in a scene, Jackson steals it without looking back.</P>
<P>When Spacey appears, the film has already run about a third of its
course.  His is an interesting character.  Made out to be some kind of
negotiating superman, our first look at him has him hopelessly trying
to get his family moving to set out on vacation.  "I can talk a man
out of blowing up the Sears Tower, but I can't talk my wife out of the
bedroom or my daughter off the phone," he says.  When he gets the call
to action, however, he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we
expect him to be.  Soon, his character has to negotiate not only with
Roman, but also with the SWAT commander (David Morse) who is itching
to send in a team to take Roman out, all the while keeping wary of the
FBI agents who are waiting to take over the operation, should
negotiations fail.  This complex set of pressures are reflected well
in Sabian the negotiator and Spacey the actor.  As the second
protagonist, Spacey measures up nicely.</P>
<P>Gray really lucked out with this cast.  David Morse as Commander Beck,
Ron Rifkin as Commander Frost, and John Spencer as Police Chief Al
Travis are all more than competent, and can hold their own in scenes
with Jackson and Spacey.  The only problem is the bit of typecasting
that results from these choices:  Morse played a similar role in THE
ROCK, Rifkin played the D.A. in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, and Spencer played
a police detective in COP LAND.  With the level of acting, however,
this can be forgiven.</P>
<P>Also in the supporting cast, Paul Giamatti as Rudy, one of the
hostages, is notable for the comic relief he provides.  His character
is initially so slimy, and Giamatti himself just looks so shifty, that
you expect to laugh before he even says anything.  Fortunately, this
doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film, but
instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which
Gray manages to sustain throughout.</P>
<P>J.T. Walsh, as the suspicious Internal Affairs inspector, clocks in
with one of his final performances.  Sadly, the talented but
underrated actor passed away in late February of this year, and the
soon to be released PLEASANTVILLE will mark his last film.  Walsh
appeared in dozens of movies such as GOOD MORNING VIETNAM, BACKDRAFT,
and NIXON.  For one of his best performances, check out SLING BLADE,
in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with Billy Bob
Thornton.  When Jack Nicholson accepted his best actor Oscar in March,
Walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success (the actors
performed together in A FEW GOOD MEN).  THE NEGOTIATOR is actually
dedicated to Walsh, and while Inspector Niebaum may not have been his
best role, it certainly characterizes the type of character for which
Walsh had become most famous for playing.</P>
<P>In the end, THE NEGOTIATOR has a plotline that parallels it's reality.
We're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are
battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will
suit each of them best.  As an audience, we're also given a situation
where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie, and
we'd like to see if one will dominate the film.  Both provide some
pretty good entertainment.</P>
