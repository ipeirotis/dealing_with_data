<P>     Following the travesty that was 1996's ill-fated attempt to update 
SGT. BILKO, I was prepared to state that I couldn't imagine a worse TV 
retread.  However, what my mind could not conceive, Hollywood has 
produced.  In fact, MCHALE'S NAVY isn't just worse -- it's fifteen 
minutes longer, which means that not only do viewers have to defend 
against yet another assault of truly uninspired content, but they have 
to endure fifteen percent more of it.</P>
<P>     One of the central questions about MCHALE'S NAVY is why anyone 
would want to make a movie out of this particular '60s show.  I suppose 
it was mildly diverting in its first incarnation, but of all the TV 
programs to resurrect, this wouldn't be near the top of most peoples' 
lists.  Lt. Commander Quinton McHale isn't the kind of figure people 
recall with great fondness when looking back on old sit-coms.  And, 
considering how poorly THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES and SGT. BILKO performed 
at the box office, one could be forgiven for assuming that Hollywood has 
gotten the message that America's passion for nostalgia only goes so 
far.</P>
<P>     MCHALE'S NAVY, as realized by director Bryan Spicer and 
screenwriter Peter Crabbe, is suitable only for movie-goers who have 
undergone frontal lobotomies.  The dearth of intelligence makes this 
film as painful to sit through as any of 1997's other worst offenders, 
and I wonder why more people didn't walk out of the screening I 
attended.  Had I not been reviewing the film, I would have headed for 
the exit about a half hour into the movie.</P>
<P>     Bellowing at the top of his voice in the vain hope that no one will 
notice that he can't act, Tom Arnold portrays McHale with all the 
delicacy of the proverbial bull in a china shop.  McHale is supposed to 
be likable, but, the way Arnold plays him, everyone in the audience is 
praying that someone will shoot him, drown him, or do something to him 
that would be unacceptable in a PG-rated movie.</P>
<P>     McHale is retired from the Navy these days and is spending his time 
as a smuggler, layabout, and little league coach.  His old crew, a bunch 
of unshaven slobs, lazy bums, and dimwits, suddenly find themselves 
under the heel of a new boss, Captain Wallace Binghampton (Dean 
Stockwell, sounding suspiciously like Bugs Bunny), who arrives at the 
Caribbean base with every intention of cleaning things up.  Alongside 
him is his no-nonsense aide, Lt. Penelope Carpenter (Debra Messing), who 
is both pretty and pretty uninteresting.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, trouble is brewing on the small island paradise.  The 
second most dangerous terrorist in the world, Major Vladikov (Tim Curry, 
slipping further back towards the campy muck from which his career was 
born), arrives with the intention of throwing the world into chaos, 
making a lot of money for himself, and evening an old score with McHale.  
When Washington learns of Vladikov's presence, a top Navy Admiral 
(Ernest Borgnine, the original TV Quinton McHale) orders Binghampton to 
get McHale back into the service, regardless of the cost.  From that 
point on, it's all by the book as McHale re-enlists, reunites his crew, 
and goes to war with Vladikov.</P>
<P>     MCHALE'S NAVY wouldn't be so bad if it was remotely funny, but, by 
the last reel, I was so starved for amusement that I was considering 
sneaking into a showing of LIAR LIAR next door.  This is inept film 
making.  Even fans of the TV show, once their curiosity has worn off 
about how the new group of actors play their old favorites, won't find 
much to appreciate about a motion picture that needs to fill the screen 
with pyrotechnics to camouflage the lack of material.  MCHALE'S NAVY 
deserves to be sunk so deeply that no one will ever think of dredging it 
up again.</P>
