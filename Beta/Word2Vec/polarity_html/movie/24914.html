<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is another in a long line of indie 'buddy films' about desperadoes
going on the road. The only thing different about this one, is that it
is consciously played for laughs, which gets it through its cartoonish
lowbrow humor, as it features characters who all have something about
them that is dysfunctional: they are illiterate, have a depraved mental
condition, suffer from greed, or just like to kill people. It's a
teenager's version of the noir classic "The Treasure of Sierra
Madre,"lacking the breath and depth in its story to touch base with the
classic, but letting its own dimwitted energy do its talking, for what
it stands for.</P>
<P>The road it takes is across the Southwestern desert and across the
barren culture of the white trash trailer park crowd. Lewis (Xuereb) is
a psychopathic killer serving time for murder, his prison mate is Clark
(Gunther) serving a 5-year term for computer fraud, and together these
opposite personalities escape, armed with a map of a gold mine in an
undisclosed destination in Mexico which a prisoner friend of Lewis' gave
him before he died. Since Lewis can't read, he decided to take Clark
along with him as a partner. Clark figures he likes gold more than he
detests Lewis, so an untenable partnership is agreed to.</P>
<P>The delicious George (McGowan) is seen climbing over a zoo fence,
stealing a rare venomous snake, while Fred (LaFleur), a man who loves to
carry a bowling ball around with him, as if to let others know how
cultured he is, finds out from George's sleazy boyfriend that the
advance he gave the couple for $10,000, for whatever illegal deal they
had going down, was lost in Las Vegas. Fred seriously beats him, but
George gets away and steals a truck from a cowboy who has the hots for
her, then dumps the truck and steals a car with a trailer hitched to it
that has the dead body of the car owner's mother, who died on a vacation
to Hollywood and is being taken back to Dallas for burial. While parked
outside a cafe, George overhears an argument Lewis and Clark are having
about Clark being upset that Lewis just killed a postman whom he thought
by the appearance of the uniform was a cop. She also hears gold mine
mentioned, and when Clark takes Lewis' gun and splits from him, she
smilingly pulls him into her car and they are off together. She's a mute
and communicates by writing. She finds out that Lewis has the map but
Clark memorized it. If he didn't, she was about to throw him out of the
car. Even though she is obviously untrustworthy and only after the
money, Clark falls heavily in love with either her or her big boobs, and
they are on their way to find the gold stopping only to screw. She does
not realize that she is being chased by Fred, who believes she still has
the money, while the police are looking for the escapees, even
circulating Lewis' picture in the newspapers.</P>
<P>Lewis soon meets up with Clark again, after he romances a sex-starved
stuck-in-the- boondocks trailer park single-mom (Paula), whose son
doesn't take his eyes off the TV
while the couple do it in the same room. He then leaves but is captured
by the cop (Bartel) he soon kills, and then he goes after Clark and
attempts to kill him at there reunion but is talked out of it for
reasons of opportunity. George becomes the femme fatale ten percent
partner to these wanted desperadoes, invaluable because she can read the
Spanish that is given in the clues of the map.</P>
<P>The funniest scene in the film, is when a van-load of obnoxious New York
tourists meet Lewis at one of the Western tourist sites, and slobber all
over him, taking his pictures, happy to have met a real cowboy, and
Lewis after playing the silent heroic cowboy for their gratification,
promptly executes all of them.</P>
<P>There is nothing that we haven't seen before in such road films, from a
vintage car convertible to a gun fetish to white trash humor, and
finally to random violence, but there is a surprise ending here
involving, what else, but, betrayal for the gold.</P>
<P>Even though there were many look-alike films, this black comedy could at
least stand alone for the laughs it presented. The characters all had
personality, and the force of the movie overall, had a desirable effect,
even if it is an easy film to forget and requires as little thinking as
possible when viewing. Enjoyable nonsense might be an apt description
for former adman Rod McCall's second feature.</P>
