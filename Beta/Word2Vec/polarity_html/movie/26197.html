<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This lighthearted fantasy asks, what if the idealist H.G. Wells didn't
just write about the Time Machine but lived it! It's mainly an
emotionally flat, one running joke type of lightweight literary film
that is done in by a very dull middle section and too much unnecessary
gore. The film has some interesting items about it, including the
onscreen romance between the two stars meeting for the first time on the
set, Malcolm McDowell as H.G. Wells and Mary Steenburgen as Amy Robbins,
whose romance continued in real life, resulting in their marriage (and
later on their divorce). The director-writer Nicholas Meyer (Star Trek
11) -- he also wrote the witty novel "Seven Percent Solution" -- worked
the screenplay from his own novel, showing some clever touches here and
there, but not enough to hold my interest for the duration of the film.
The theme grew tiresome and David Warner as Jack the Ripper never
developed as a particularly interesting villain. There was nothing
gained by seeing him hold a scalpel to a woman's throat and then slit
it.</P>
<P>The film opens in the Victorian London of the late 19th century. Dr.
John Leslie Stevenson, a friend in Wells' inner circle and a noted
surgeon, gets exposed as Jack the Ripper, after he just slices up a
prostitute and the police trail him to Wells' house. He escapes arrest
by fleeing in Wells's Time Machine he was demonstrating to friends in
his cellar. He raised the money to build the machine by his writings in
the newspapers on free love and on utopian socialism, believing that the
future would be a place of no hatreds and no wars.</P>
<P>Wells determines that Jack the Ripper escaped into the 20th century,
ending up in the San Francisco of 1979. He decides to follow him, as the
machine returns after Jack arrives at his destination. The Time Machine
works by the cosmic rays of the sun and by possessing the master
ignition key, it enables the passenger to return with the machine to his
original place of departure. If you don't have the key, you can't
return. With the key still in his possession, Wells goes in pursuit of
Jack the Ripper, figuring it is his responsibility to stop him from
killing others.</P>
<P>In San Francisco, there are some amusing moments as the naive Wells has
to adjust to the modern complexities of the world and its hustle and
bustle. He is perplexed to see airplanes, hail a cab, ride in a car,
speak on the phone, but one thing is evident, he has not arrived at
Utopia: hearing about wars, death camps, terrorist actions, and all the
daily crimes just sickens him, as he can't wait to return to Victorian
London.</P>
<P>In his pursuit of Jack, he meets a kooky bank officer and the two become
an odd romantic couple. He seems adorably old-fashioned and gentlemanly,
with a very stand-offish British wit, while she's an aggressive woman's
libber, a modern California-type of lady, and an admirer of British
eccentrics who are straight.</P>
<P>Three women are slain in the style of Jack the Ripper, which clinches it
for Wells, that he hasn't changed. Jack easily fits in with the modern
times, while Wells is disillusioned, realizing that he was wrong about
the world changing for the better. It just advanced in technology but
regressed into a more violent state than ever before.</P>
<P>The police think he is a lunatic and don't take him seriously when he
tells them about Jack the Ripper. Amy only believes him when he takes
her for a spin in the machine. They travel a few days ahead into the
future, where a newspaper headlines Amy as the serial killer's 5th
victim. They quickly go back to regular time to prevent her murder but
can't stop murder number 4, even though they know where it is taking
place. The film has many plot holes and flaws, one of them is: that it
is not possible to go back in time and change history, all one can
change is something that is only a duplicate, even if you think you are
changing something, you are only deceived by appearances. Albert
Einstein mentioned that about time travel and that's good enough for me.</P>
<P>Jack wants the key Wells has to the machine and threatens to kill Amy if
he doesn't get it, as the two battle each other. The film concludes as
Jack and Wells tussle over Amy, and through some clever turns Wells is
able to outwit his former friend and chess opponent, who always used to
beat Wells.</P>
<P>The Jack the Ripper part of the story never really worked as a thriller,
it all seemed too heavy and misplaced, I am certain the film could have
been salvaged if it kept with the fantasy/romance story between Amy and
Wells. That part of the film was amusing and gave way to some
interesting insights about the modern world. The film suffered from
being too poorly presented, as it always appeared less than exciting,
nevertheless it was occasionally diverting, and some cult sci-fi fans
might like it more than the general public should.</P>
