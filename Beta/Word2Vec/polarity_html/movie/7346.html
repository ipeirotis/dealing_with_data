<P>     Most romantic comedies make it known early in the proceedings that 
they intend to follow all the time-honored, tried-and-true conventions 
of the genre by leading us down a well-trodden path littered with 
formulaic plots and overused character types.  For the most part, 'TIL 
THERE WAS YOU, 1997's April romance movie, manages to avoid this trap, 
and, in the process, has the dubious distinction of making us wonder if 
by-the-numbers familiarity is necessarily a bad thing.  In trying to be 
different by using the SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE approach of keeping the main 
characters apart until the finale, 'TIL THERE WAS YOU feels like a joke 
without a punchline.  The payoff, such as it is, is distressingly 
anticlimactic, and results in frustration. </P>
<P>     Comparisons with SLEEPLESS are unavoidable.  Nora Ephron's 1993 
summer splash, which has inexplicably become something of a recent 
classic of the genre, takes the risk of keeping Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks a 
continent away from each other for the entire movie.  Nevertheless, 
because the actors are charismatic and their characters are likable, the 
picture never loses its way.  We look forward to the inevitable moment 
when the two will meet, but the script doesn't seem to be dragging its 
feet getting to that point.   </P>
<P>     That's not the case with 'TIL THERE WAS YOU.  Although many of the 
details are different from those in SLEEPLESS, the approach and intent 
are the same.  Sadly, the rhythm is all wrong.  Jeanne Tripplehorn, best 
known to this point as Michael Douglas' wife from BASIC INSTINCT, is 
Gwen, an incurable romantic who has waited her entire life for the right 
person.  Now in her early thirties, she's beginning to lose faith in 
life and love.  Every time she meets a man, there are problems.  Little 
does she know that Mr. Right is nearby, only she keeps missing him. </P>
<P>     Mr. Right is actually Nick (Dylan McDermott, DESTINY TURNS ON THE 
RADIO), an architect who is charitably described as "emotionally 
unavailable."  Nick is involved with Francesca (Sarah Jessica Parker), 
the childhood TV star of a BRADY BUNCH knockoff who grew up to become a 
wealthy, materialistic, insecure ex-drug addict.  These two live 
together, rather unhappily, while Gwen floats around the periphery of 
their lives, occasionally coming into contact with Francesca, but never 
meeting Nick.  Until the end, that is, when fate finally intervenes.   </P>
<P>     Part of the problem with 'TIL THERE WAS YOU is that the characters 
aren't all that compelling.  Just because they have arcs (Gwen gaining 
confidence in her ability to write; Nick learning the value of truth) 
doesn't mean that they're well-developed.  And let's face it:  McDermott 
and Tripplehorn aren't Hanks and Ryan.  They don't light up the screen 
in such a way that their mere presence can save an otherwise-stillborn 
scene.  And 'TIL THERE WAS YOU has many stagnant moments.  At one-
hundred twelve minutes, it runs too long and becomes unnecessarily 
involved in poorly-developed, uninteresting subplots (like the one to 
save an "historically important" housing complex).  Instead of waiting 
expectantly for Nick and Gwen to meet, we become impatient for the 
encounter.  The movie fails to divert us along the long and twisting 
road to their rendezvous. </P>
<P>     And, when that meeting finally takes place, it's disappointing.  By 
playing a song over their first significant conversation, 'TIL THERE WAS 
YOU robs us of the chance to hear Nick and Gwen getting to know each 
other.  After that, the film hurries to the "happily ever after" 
conclusion without giving us the opportunity to care whether the 
relationship works.  First time feature director Scott Winant and 
screenwriter Winnie Holzman have apparently forgotten why people go to 
romantic comedies. </P>
<P>     As disappointing as much of 'TIL THERE WAS YOU is, there are some 
high points.  Certain individual scenes -- Gwen's revealing heart-to-
heart with her father (Michael Tucker), Gwen and Francesca's lively 
bathroom chat, and Nick's final attempt to be truly honest with 
Francesca -- work extremely well.  I also appreciated the manner in 
which coincidence is woven throughout the script without the characters 
ever making mention of it (for example, it's up to us to figure out that 
Nick's father's uncle was Gwen's grandmother's long lost love).   </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the good parts of 'TIL THERE WAS YOU are oases in a 
desert.  They can't save the whole thing, which, in the end, seems like 
nothing more ambitious than a SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE wannabe.  By 
definition, romantic comedies are supposed to be "feel good" 
experiences, but, rather than leaving its audience enchanted, 'TIL THERE 
WAS YOU trails dissatisfaction in its wake.   </P>
