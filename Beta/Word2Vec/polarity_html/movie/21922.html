<P>     Somehow, somewhere, this whole "anime" wave has left me behind. Sure,
the Japanese animation style is distinctive, but it strikes me that the
form has not progressed radically in the 30 years since "Speed Racer." 
Though the backgrounds may have become richer, there's still a vaguely
Anglicized blandness to the character design, a strange lack of fluidity
to the acrobatic movements. When the Japanese smash PRINCESS MONONOKE made
its way to our shores, it was spoken of as the future of animation. I was
skeptical that it would bring anything that wasn't already the past of
anime.</P>
<P>     From an animation standpoint, I still think that's true, though
PRINCESS MONONOKE does have some striking imagery. The real revelation in
the film is the depth and complexity of its mythology and storytelling,
which manage to overcome the problems with the human story. Hayao
Miyazaki's tale begins with a prince named Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) of an
exiled tribe. In the course of defending his village from a boar-demon,
Ashitaka is infected with a malignancy that can only be cured by the Great
Forest Spirit. Thus Ashitaka begins a quest that leads him to an iron
mining town at the edge of a huge forest, a town led by the Lady Eboshi
(Minnie Driver). The town is in conflict not only with a rival warlord who
wants a share of the iron, but with the nature spirits who loathe the
encroachment of humans on their forest. Ashitaka finds himself caught in
the middle, especially when he becomes enamored of San (Claire Danes), the
human stepdaughter of the great wolf goddess Moro (Gillian Anderson).</P>
<P>     In case there is any confusion on the subject, let's be clear that
PRINCESS MONONOKE is a film for adults. Heads and limbs fly at a rate
approaching that of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and the manipulative monk Jigo (Billy
Bob Thornton) uses some salty language. It also maintains an adult tone in
the set-up of its mystical world, with gods who can be petulant, violent
and even just plain stupid (a cosmology far more in keeping with most
ancient civilizations' mythologies than Disney's benign pantheisms). Most
impressive, Miyazaki keeps his story free of the didacticism so common in
films with environmental themes. Lady Eboshi isn't portrayed as some
cackling, grasping villain representing "civilization bad" -- instead,
she's a philanthropist revered by the lepers and former prostitutes she
employs in her iron works. While the nature gods are understandably bitter
as they watch forests fall, theirs is not the only side of this
story. Rare is the tale that suggests industry could be a co-existing
entity in nature, rather than an inherent evil.</P>
<P>     PRINCESS MONONOKE is so engrossing as both legend and lesson that you
wish it could treat its characters with more care. The conflicts of its
principal characters (Ashitaka's struggle with his ever-more-homicidal
infected arm, San's struggle to reconcile her human and lupine 
backgrounds) are given only passing attention, leaving most of the focus
on the set pieces and the philosophy. The line readings by the English
actors are flat and constricted, performances set to a stopwatch of mouth
movements instead of to the needs of the scene. And then there's the
dialogue, which generally ranges from the annoyingly literalist 
(characters seem incapable of looking at a thing without calling out its
name) to the purely giggle-inducing (I don't believe I'll ever embrace
unreservedly a film that includes the line, "Forest Spirit, we give you
back your head"). PRINCESS MONONOKE at times appears to be an animated
variation on this year's more ballyhooed version of mythopoetics over
substance, THE PHANTOM MENACE.</P>
<P>     Still, there is something compelling about the look of PRINCESS
MONONOKE, more so than I was expecting. The design of the supernatural
characters is always intriguing, from the writhing worm-bodies of the
demons to the Pillsbury Doughboy-cum-tiki-idol sprites called the
Kodamas; the battlefields are arresting in their gore-spattered silence.  
Indeed, silence plays an unexpectedly effective role in this epic film,
giving it a sense of reverence. There's just the problem of those darned
people, whose homogeneity in word and countenance hinders an otherwise
stellar effort. Anime may be more or less what it used to be, but at least
the storytelling behind it is growing up.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 anime shuns:  6.</PRE>
