<P>     It has been ten years since Venezuela-born Fina Torres blasted onto 
the international film making scene with ORIANA, the Camera d'Or winner 
at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival.  Now, after a decade of relative 
motion picture inactivity, Torres has released her second feature, 
CELESTIAL CLOCKWORK, which is currently playing at film festivals and 
will soon be released nationally by October Films.  Unfortunately, 
although CELESTIAL CLOCKWORK boasts amazingly off-beat visuals and 
quirky plot twists, the basic narrative is stale.</P>
<P>     Fans of the film laud it as a modern-day, feminist ALICE IN 
WONDERLAND meets THE WIZARD OF OZ.  And, while there's no denying that 
elements of both stories permeate Torres' movie, the basic story isn't 
all that interesting.  The appealing performance of lead actress Ariadna 
Gil, the bizarre imagery, and the air of lunacy are the elements that 
keep this film moving forward.  Delve beneath the singing Maria Callas 
poster, the glowing love potions, and the roiling clouds, and you'll 
discover that CELESTIAL CLOCKWORK's basic framework is threadbare.</P>
<P>     The movie focuses on a beautiful young woman who finds liberation 
by rejecting her old, restricted life for a new existence in the City of 
Lights.  Ana (Gil) reaches the altar before realizing that marriage is a 
mistake.  Before saying "I do", however, she jilts her would-be 
bridegroom, hops on a plane, and soars to Paris.  There, she moves in 
with four Latina women and coaxes an eccentric Russian singing teacher 
to accept her as a pupil.  Soon, one of Ana's roommates, Celeste 
(Arielle Dombasle), becomes jealous of her vocal talents, and Ana is 
forced to move out.  She next shares an apartment with an unconventional 
psychologist (Evelyne Didi) who falls in love with her.  Meanwhile, 
French immigration officials are after Ana to deport her, and, in order 
to remain in the country and pursue a coveted film role, she agrees to 
marry a gay astrologist who wants to have a big church wedding to please 
his parents.</P>
<P>     CELESTIAL CLOCKWORK boasts a gaggle of unusual characters, only a 
few of whom are developed beyond the "quirky" level.  The villainous 
Celeste, for example, is defined largely by eyes that glow evilly and an 
affinity for singing songs like "Sometimes I Eat Spiders".  Ana is 
really the only three-dimensional character, and even her personality 
has some obvious holes.  None of these deficiencies, however, detract 
from the movie's basic message of self-discovery through the repudiation 
of conventions and others' expectations.  </P>
<P>     As intriguing as some of the color-supersaturated visuals are, this 
film is as much a treat for the ears as for the eyes.  Boasting a rich 
and varied soundtrack predominated by classical opera, there's hardly a 
moment when someone isn't singing.  CELESTIAL CLOCKWORK is a cacophony 
of hue, light, and sound -- at times it doesn't seem important how well 
the plot holds together.  As a series of ethereal moments strung 
together by cobwebs, CELESTIAL CLOCKWORK makes for fine, feather-light 
entertainment, but, beneath all the delightful distractions, there's a 
discouraging lack of substance. </P>
