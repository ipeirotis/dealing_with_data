<PRE>                                 TURBULENCE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<P>     After seeing an ad of an airplane in a thunderstorm, readers might
accidentally believe that the name of the movie TURBULENCE refers to
some atmospheric condition.  After enduring all of this NIGHTMARE ON
ELM STREET meets AIRPORT, I can correct this misconception.  The title
refers to the state of mind of writers Jonathan Brett, Steven E. De
Souza, and John Herzfeld when they composed the script.</P>
<P>     I would like to issue a challenge to viewers of this film by
director Robert Butler.  Why don't you take along an abacus and try to
count the number of actions that either make no sense or are just
outright ludicrous?  I lost track, but I know the number is in the high
double digits.  So that not too many more of you waste your money on
this monstrosity, I will tell you several of them, but rest assured
that I have just scratched the surface.  If you are worried about my
giving away part of the plot, I will probably not tell you much more
than the trailers, but I will use many examples to illustrate my
points.</P>
<P>     Detective Hines (Hector Elizondo) has tracked down serial killer
Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta).  Although Weaver is supposed to have raped
and murdered five women and killed several cops, there is a question of
whether Hines has planted evidence, and there is a hint of a possible
Internal Affairs investigation.  After Weaver is cuffed and is lying on
the ground, Hines will unbelievably start kicking him in front of the
other officers.  (Don't forget to count.)</P>
<P>     Weaver and another, much slimier looking criminal named Stubbs,
played with all the finesse of a wrestling star by Brendan Gleeson, are
being extradited to LA.  They are flown across the country on a 747
commercial airplane.  Weaver says, "Stubbs may be a moron, but he's a
professional."  The script is so bad that I was laughing very loudly at
all the wrong places.</P>
<P>     Here is a question for you.  You are sitting in a plane seat.
Outside your window six vans labeled "Corrections" come screeching up
with their sirens blaring.  Out of them jump several marshals with
large guns, bringing two prisoners in chains to ride in the aircraft
with you.  Now, do you walk or run for the nearest exit?  Trick
question.  You stay of course.  And if you are a stewardess like Teri
Halloran (Lauren Holly) who has just been jilted by her fiance, you
start making eyes at the cute serial rapist.</P>
<P>     I have lots more questions for you.  Let's say you are a federal
marshal and your prisoner goes to the bathroom.  Do you think it is
necessary to keep a close eye on him?</P>
<P>     Soon there will be a gunfight. Holes are blown in the plane that
miraculously will later seem to self-repair, but before they do, the
plane will start losing control.  Here are two of my favorites
questions.  If you are a flight attendant, do you think you might want
to call the captain to tell him what is going on?  And if you are the
last person left flying the plane and the plane is on the verge of
free-fall, do you think you'd take off your seat belt to roam around
the plane to check on the rest of flight crew?</P>
<P>     When most of the people on the plane are murdered, who is looked
upon first to provide leadership?  The friendly serial killer of
course.  As you may guess, this misguided trust will soon pass and the
real hero of the tale will emerge, flight attendant Teri.  She will go
to the cockpit and fly the plane.  Well, that is when she isn't trying
to be Sigourney Weaver to Liotta's rendition of the monster.  This
shamelessly manipulative story titillates the audience with a
never-to-be sex scene as a prelude to more violence.</P>
<P>     The only part of the show that works has the plane heading through
the thunderstorm while crisis control in LA is helping our poor
heroine.  Rachel Ticotin plays Rachel, the leader of the crisis center.
She tries to reassure Teri by telling her, "You are flying the most
sophisticated plane ever built."  "Yes, but what if this sophisticated
plane," asks Teri, "flies into an unsophisticated storm?"</P>
<P>     Of all of the flaws in the show, my favorite is when Weaver is
outside the thin wooden cockpit door trying to enter.  Does he break it
down?  No, he tries to talk Teri into coming out.  The piece de
resistance is the crisis control center's attitude.  At first they tell
her to ignore him since he will kill her, but then they decide maybe it
would be okay after all.  She leaves to walk over all the dead bodies.
Surprise, he is out there lurking in wait for her.  And surprise, the
scene is lifted straight out of a schlock horror film.</P>
<P>     Halfway through this abysmal picture, I began to think of the
Roman emperors.  I wanted so bad to stand up, turn my thumbs down, and
yell, "kill 'em all."</P>
<P>     Let me leave you with the question that Weaver asks Teri: "You are
a convicted inmate on death row.  What five albums would you pick?"</P>
<P>     TURBULENCE runs 1:43.  It is rated R for gory violence, implied
rape, and profanity. The show would probably be okay for older
teenagers who like horror flicks.  I hated this movie and recommend
everyone avoid it.  I give it 1/2 of a star for the special effects.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
