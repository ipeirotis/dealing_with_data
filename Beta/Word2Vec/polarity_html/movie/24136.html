<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This film is tied together by four tired soap opera tales, that are
competently-crafted but predictable. They are heart rendering tales of
love turned sour. Instead of being set in 1940s Egypt, this faithful
adaptation of Nobel Prize-winning Naguib Mahfouz's novel, is set in a
modern Mexican city, on a street called Midaq Alley. In my humble
opinion, this film could have been made by using only one of the
stories, instead of making them into roughly four- 40 minute segments,
each with a title flashed on the screen to indicate the start of the new
story. The four segments, which three of them are introduced by a game
of dominoes being played in a bar, are entitled: Rutilio, Alma,
Susanita, and The Return (Chava and Abel return from the States), with
each segment taking the view of the titled character. It is hard to
believe that this film won more awards than any other Mexican film ever
has! It makes you wonder about the quality of film that didn't win an
award.</P>
<P>In the first story, Mr. Ru is a macho man and hardworker, grimacing at
life as he sees its dark side from working in the bar that he owns on
Midaq Alley. His only son Chava is called lazybones by him, as he wishes
only to leave Mexico and live in the States and get rich quickly.
Chava's best friend is the young barber Abel, who dreams of some day
owning his own beauty parlor and marrying the beautiful Alma, a
neighborhood young girl he has known all his life. The two friends are
ridiculed by Mr. Ru for always hanging around together and for acting
like queers. This in-fighting between father and son, delights his
regular customers, the domino players.</P>
<P>After a night of forced lovemaking to celebrate with his wife Eusebia
their thirtieth wedding anniversary, Ru decides to become queer. It
happens just like that! The next day he's a queer and goes into a
department store and buys socks, in the process picking up the reserved
young sales clerk Jimy. Their gay union upsets Chava, who in a fit of
rage, cracks open Jimy's skull and then talks Abel into running away
with him to Tijuana and eventually to the States. Mr. Ru tells his wife,
I was going to leave him the bar and provide for him in every way, but
he disappointed me, as this segment ends with Ru weeping that he lost
his only son.</P>
<P>The second segment, the most bearable one of the four, mainly because
Salma Hayek as Alma, is a real knockout and her story of being poor,
looking for someone to take care of her, is filled with all the clichés
befitting the telling of a story about a young virgin lover, and of her
failure to find love. It is the usual tear-jerker fare seen on those
afternoon soap operas on American TV. She is impatient for the barber to
love her and open his own shop, but when he suddenly leaves with Chava,
even as they are embracing each other and promising to love each other
forever, he unexpectedly leaves her with the promise that he will return
soon with money and offer her his hand in marriage. She is confused and
disappointed by his action and she is ashamed with herself why they
never had sex to bond their relationship. Soon, after he is gone, an
elderly shop keeper, Mr. Fidel, comes onto her and with her mother's
permission, she accepts his proposal for marriage. But he has a fatal
heart attack just before the wedding, at Mr. Ru's bar, while playing
dominoes.</P>
<P>Alma, meanwhile, has been pursued in the street by a handsome rich man
named Jose Luis, who tracks her down, tempting her with his wealth, good
looks and self-confidence. He turns out to be a coke-sniffing pimp, who
turns her into a high-class whore. She runs away from home and lives in
his whorehouse, with him completely dominating her life, as her
impatience to wait for the right man ruins her life.</P>
<P>The third story is about a buck-toothed, middle-aged spinster, Susanita,
who is the landlord where Alma and her mother Cata dwell. Susanita is
desperate to meet a man before she gets too old, and is happy when she
has her fortune read in the cards by Cata and is told that the cards say
a man of passion will come into her life. At first she thinks that man
is Chava, but he only came to her on the night of his flight away from
here in order to get money. But he did arouse her sexual curiosity. She
then lures the 26-year-old sneak-thief waiter in Mr. Ru's bar, Guicho,
to marry her. He steals from her as he still does from Mr. Ru. When she
catches him in the act and asks him to leave, he begs her to not kick
him out. After all, she decides, she did get her teeth fixed and still
needs someone to love her, so, she keeps this untrustworthy thief as her
husband.</P>
<P>The final episode is about the return of the two young men, Chava and
Abel, who went to the States to make their fortune. Chava returns after
being away for two years, with a wife and a baby son. He has split from
Abel after a disagreement in the States and is surprised when Abel soon
shows up, courting Alma at her apartment door. For Chava, it is tough
going because his father is still angry with him and his marriage is not
a happy one and his economic prospects are dim. For Abel, it is a
bitterly disappointing time, as he returns home broke without any
economic prospects and he has found out that his virgin love is now a
whore and a drug addict. He goes to the whorehouse and confronts Alma,
but she can't leave. He then comes back and slashes her pimp with a
razor before he is fatally knifed in the stomach by the pimp.</P>
<P>On the plus side, the stories are intricately woven together so that
they make sense. There is much humor in the telling of the stories and
the acting is decent. Otherwise, this plays mostly as glorified soap
opera, with few surprises in all of its lengthy presentation.</P>
