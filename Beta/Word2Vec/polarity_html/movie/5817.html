<P>     When discussing "giants" of the non-English-speaking, international 
film world, four names leap immediately to mind:  Ingmar Bergman, 
Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, and Satyajit Ray.  Of these men, Ray 
has received the least North American exposure, but, arguably, the most 
critical acclaim.  Praise for the Indian director, who died in 1992 
shortly after receiving a lifetime achievement Oscar, has been effusive 
from both film makers and critics.  Vincent Canby, of the NEW YORK 
TIMES, once wrote that "an entire world is evoked" by each of Ray's 
films.  The late Louis Malle called Ray's body of work "magical and 
completely unique."  And James Ivory, the director of HOWARDS END and 
THE REMAINS OF THE DAY, has said that, after watching a Ray movie, the 
viewer will feel "fulfilled, enriched, maybe wiser, and wanting more."  </P>
<P>     Indeed, it is Ivory, along with his partner, Ismail Merchant, who 
has made this screening of PATHER PANCHALI, Ray's directorial debut, 
possible.  With financial backing from Sony Pictures Classics, Merchant 
and Ivory have cleaned up, packaged, and released a series of Ray 
pictures for distribution in select United States theaters.  Included in 
"The Masterworks of Satyajit Ray" is the complete APU TRILOGY, which is 
comprised of three of the director's early films:  PATHER PANCHALI, 
APARAJITO, and THE WORLD OF APU.  The movies, which exist on video but 
are not readily available, are worth searching out.  Anyone who believes 
in the uplifting power of motion pictures will not be disappointed.</P>
<P>     PATHER PANCHALI, Ray's first foray into the film making world, was 
completed in 1955, and proceeded to win the top prize at the 1956 Cannes 
Film Festival.  It's a quiet, simple tale, centering on the life of a 
small family living in a rural village in Bengal.  The father, Harihar 
(Kanu Bannerjee), is a priest and poet who cares more about his writing 
and spiritual welfare than obtaining wages he is owed.  The mother, 
Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee), worries that her husband's financial 
laxity will leave her without enough food for her two children, daughter 
Durga (Uma Das Gupta) and son Apu (Chunibala Devi).  Harihar's family 
often lives on the edge of poverty, coping with the unkind taunts of 
their neighbors, the burden of caring for an aging aunt (Chunibala 
Devi), and the terrible aftermath of a natural catastrophe.</P>
<P>     PATHER PANCHALI starts slowly, but builds inexorably towards a 
powerful climax as we come to know, and empathize with, the characters.  
Ray takes the time to create a meticulously believable world that draws 
the viewer in.  There isn't a false note in the entire film -- not in 
the characterization, the dialogue, or the storyline.  The emotions 
evoked by the events of PATHER PANCHALI are honest and true, not the 
contrived byproducts of manipulative formulas.  Ray makes us feel with 
the characters, not just for them.</P>
<P>     Most of what transpires is shown through the eyes of either 
Sarbojaya or Durga, and, as a result, we identify most closely with 
these two.  Harihar is absent for more than half of the movie, and, 
before the penultimate scene, Abu is a mere witness to events, rather 
than a participant.  Until the closing moments, we don't get a sense of 
the young boy as a fully formed individual, since he's always in someone 
else's shadow.  </P>
<P>     With its often-poetic black-and-white images and heartfelt method 
of storytelling, PATHER PANCHALI speaks intimately to each member of the 
audience.  This tale, as crafted by Ray, touches the souls and minds of 
viewers, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers.  The languorous 
pace, which initially seems detrimental, proves to be an asset -- PATHER 
PANCHALI would not have been the same experience had material been cut. 
Each scene builds upon what has come before.  This is the kind of motion 
picture that will stay with you for hours, or perhaps even days, after 
you've left the theater, and that's a rare characteristic for any movie.</P>
