<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Oliver Stone's impression of the Vietnam War, taken from when he
observed it first-hand,  as a grunt. He uses an innocent, middle-class
college drop-out, who volunteers to join an infantry unit for patriotic
reasons, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), to be his alter-ego. He is the
narrator and consumate letter writer to his grandmother, which allows us
to hear his personal reactions to what is happening; it is through his
eyes that we see the savagery of the war. It is a film that should
satisfy the protesters of the war for its depiction of it as being
without merit, but it also should satisfy those who are entertained by
the blood and gore action scenes. It portends to be a film about the
real war in Vietnam and not someone's metaphor for the war.</P>
<P>The first thing Taylor sees as his transport plane lands in Vietnam are
all the body bags and the disheartened looks of the soldiers leaving to
go back home. It is 1967. His unit will be somewhere near the Cambodian
border, in the jungle, where just existing in the stifling humidity,
with the snakes and bugs, is difficult enough. Taylor is immediately
sorry he joined and doesn't think he will make it through his year's
tour of duty.</P>
<P>On patrol, the stillness of this alien place is disturbing even if it is
visually beautiful. The men make their way through the dense bush
country on forced marches in the oppressive heat and then spend
sleepless nights, trying to avoid an ambush. No one cares if the new men
live or die. No one tells them what to do. If they survive, it will be
mostly because of luck. Sgt. Barnes (Tom Berenger) believes in the war.
He believes he represents reality and is a defender of the system. He
thinks, once the system breaks down, we all break down. He is hard-nosed
and combat-wise, the most experienced fighter in the company, the one
telling the commanding officer what to do. But while being a great
warrior, he has also lost his compassion for people. The company
commander, Lieutenant Wolfe (Mark Moses), is a college grad,
inexperienced in battle, trying to do the best he can, but not able to
connect with the grunts under him or earn the respect of his sergeants.
Sgt. Elias (Willem Dafoe) is the other experienced leader, called a
crusader by Barnes. He's a pothead who believed in the war in 1965 but
doesn't now. He realizes that the purpose of the war is not clear, that
it is inevitable the Americans will lose. He cares about the men and has
a loyal following, as the men get split in following either sergeant's
leadership. Taylor will side with Elias and joins him in his escape from
reality. Vietnam becomes like a microcosm of the way Americans back home
view the war.</P>
<P>Taylor's baptism under fire occurs at night when the unit sets a trap
for the Viet Cong. In an instant, trip-wired mines detonate, and all
hell breaks loose. Taylor survives with a minor scratch. He is falsely
blamed for sleeping through his watch on guard duty. It was actually the
disgruntled Junior (Johnson) who went back to sleep when Taylor woke him
for duty. Taylor's only blunder was that he froze when he saw the Viet
Cong and couldn't fire at them. As a result a few men are casualties,
including some new recruits.</P>
<P>Taylor joins Elias' drug smoking, rock'n'roll clique and smokes weed for
the first-time. When they question him, they are bewildered as to why he
is there, as he seems to be the only rich kid among them, the others are
high school drop-outs, the unemployed, and the poor. They are the bottom
of the barrel in American society, as the educated found ways of
avoiding the unpopular war. There also is a split along racial lines, as
the blacks and whites mainly stay in their own groups. For Taylor, his
initiation ritual with the potheads culminates, as Elias, in a drugged
state, tells the very high Taylor, now that you smoked, "The worm has
turned for you."</P>
<P>On the next mission, they come across Viet Cong tunnels, which are
booby-trapped. A few of the soldiers are killed and one of them has been
tied to a tree with his throat cut. The company comes to a nearby
village, angered and ready for revenge. These scenes are masterfully
done by Stone, as it is a reminder of My Lai, although it doesn't turn
into such a disastrous outcome. It is shown from the soldier's
perspective, how war dehumanizes one and survival becomes a basic
instinct. In the village, the men are suspicious that there are Viet
Cong forces being sheltered by them. Some act brutally. Some do what is
ethical. Some just want to make sure they don't overlook the danger they
are in and act cautiously. But since the men are in a dangerous
situation, it is hard to determine what is really the correct thing to
do, except there is no excuse for the excessive cruelty shown by some of
the men. There is the horrible incident where a redneck soldier, Bunny
(Dillon), who in an odd way enjoys being in Viet Nam. He feels free here
because no one tells him what to do; he smashes the head open of a
Vietnamese with his rifle butt, of whom he assumes, is an enemy 'gook.'
Barnes's men having arrived first use the excuse of finding some weapons
to begin intimidating the villagers, killing livestock; and, Barnes,
goes so far as killing an old woman. Elias' arrival on the scene
prevents a My Lai, as he tells Barnes of his intention to bring him up
for a court-martial. The tense situation is temporarily handled by Capt.
Harris (Dale Dye), who promises a full investigation back at the base
camp but tells everyone that they're still on the front-line and have to
work together.</P>
<P>This is a visceral film, even if the enemy is not distinguishable in
battle and appear like shadowy figures. They are faceless objects of the
war. The object for the ordinary infantry soldier is just counting the
days when he goes home. No one talks about why they are fighting. But it
is just for survival; survival is what mainly interests the men, and
they will choose which is the way they want to fight for survival. The
ones who follow Barnes think he is invincible, he can't die, that by
following him they will come out of the war alive. For some of the
others, they will do anything they can to make it out of here...even
smoke weed until everything seems unreal. All that counts for them is
get home alive. But one thing is certain, every infantryman lost his
innocence in the war.</P>
<P>Platoon is a moving film about the horrors of war. It is a visual film
that explores the reality of the actual war, told from the soldier's
point of view. It is one of the better war films made because it seems
real. It has an integrity to it because it is made by someone who knows
what the soldier faced and is able to communicate this. Taylor
summarizes the director's view by saying in a voiceover: "Looking back,
we did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves-and the enemy was within
us." The director's one fault, was that he couldn't resist feeding the
audience with his opinion, not able to rely completely on the visual
impact of his story to do the job.</P>
