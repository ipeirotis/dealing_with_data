<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Director-in-exile Roman Polanski (Rosemary's Baby) and the occult go
together like butter and toast. This, his first film since his 1994's
Death and the Maiden, is a visually stunning mystery chiller about the
supernatural that is a good example of old-fashioned storytelling. A
lengthy film (132 minutes) that doesn't overstay its welcome, as it
keeps one guessing till the very end how it will be resolved and even
then, there is puzzlement. But the film is not without some flaws in its
storytelling as attested by the last scenes, which are resolved in
pyrotechnics and do leave a lot to be desired.</P>
<P>Many critics will justifiably argue that there is no proper payoff in
the director's payoff. But I'll take this Polanski version of a horror
story over so many others that I have seen recently, there is an elegant
craftsmanship and an ability shown by him, to keep one in suspense for
most of the film without resorting to Hollywood's special effect grab
bag of tricks typically used for this genre. Polansky also captured the
feel of what it is like to be a rare-book collector. It is a film that,
if it does nothing else, it depicts the lives of those who are searching
for dramatic meaning in their life through books of the occult. That
Polanski is a skeptic, only adds resonance to the telling of the story.</P>
<P>A sleazy Manhattan rare-book dealer and consumate chain-smoker, Dean
Corso (Johnny Depp), is hired for a significant fee by a sinister,
extremely wealthy collector of occult books, Boris Balkan (Frank
Langella), to track down and authenticate which of the three extant
copies of a 17th century illustrated book "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom
of Shadows" authored by Satan himself is not the forgery. Aristide
Torchia, who co-authored the book, was burned to death by the Spanish
Inquisition as a heretic.</P>
<P>Balkan as owner of one of the three copies, has an overconfident
reliance on his demonic beliefs. He is dressed in an expensive
pin-striped Armani-type suit. After Corso meets with him in his sleek
New York skylight library setting, he is told that he will have to
travel to Portugal and France to track down the other two books.</P>
<P>The first casualty of the book is an elderly gentleman (Willy
Holt-Polansky's art director in "Bitter Moon") who hangs himself from a
chandelier in his study. He sold his book to Balkan the day before
killing himself. Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) is his rich widow. She aptly
fits the description of a femme fatale in a noir film, dressed in a very
unwidow-like black, as she seduces the book detective Corso in his New
York apartment. She comes calling on him, trying any possible means to
get back the book. When she is through with her sexual romp on the floor
with the owlishly bespectacled Corso, who is sporting a goatee, she
discovers the scholarly looking lover of rare books doesn't have the
copy of Balkan's Ninth Gates in his knapsack. She will, thusly, hunt him
down for the book throughout Europe, using her bodyguard/lover (Amoni),
a black man with blond hair (an albino), to do all her dirty work.</P>
<P>The only friend the mercenary broker seems to have, is Bernie (Russo), a
New York rare-book dealer, whom he has entrusted the invaluable book
with. When he heads to the airport, he stops by Bernie's bookstore to
get the book and finds him hung upside down in a similar way to the
first illustration in the Devil's book. Corso takes the book Bernie
securely hid for him to Europe and places it in his knapsack. He does
not make a copy of the book and therefore places himself in an awkward
spot if the book should be stolen.</P>
<P>In Toledo, Spain, Corso goes to the Ceniza Bros. bookstore, where the
Telfers acquired the "The Ninth Gates," interviewing the twins (Jose
Lopez Rodero-he plays both parts through the clever use of f/x
camerawork), in a scene that was deliciously funny, as they explain what
a forgery is and how rare-books could be verified by how they are bound
together. Corso then visits with Victor Fargas in Sintra, Portugal, who
now owns the book. It is interesting to see this once grand mansion
where the nobleman Fargas lives and how the once wealthy intellectual is
forced to survive by selling off a few of his rare books every so often,
but who refuses to sell the book that Corso wishes to obtain. His unique
lifestyle is one that is rarely depicted in movies as well as it is
here.</P>
<P>After some hectic dealings in Portugal, Corso takes his detective work
to Paris, where he meets the elderly wheelchair-bound Baroness Kessler
(Jefford-noted Shakespearian actress), in an attempt to see if Lucifer
has put his autograph on her book. Not surprisingly, murders and
intrigue follow the book detective's path, as he gets more fully
enmeshed in the search for authenticity. Some of the collectors believe
that by having the right formula they can conjure up the materialization
of Lucifer himself, giving the person holding that secret the same power
as God, which is indeed, if possible, more than what money can buy.</P>
<P>While Corso goes from one "Ninth Gates" owner to another to authenticate
their copies, he's pursued by a nameless, green-eyed blonde (Emmanuelle
Seigner-Polanski's actress wife), who appears out of nowhere and acts as
his guardian angel, and who may possess supernatural powers. She is the
most enigmatic character in the story, whose real identity will be
revealed by the end of the film. She did not appear to be like the other
book lovers in the film, even her choice of reading material is absurd,
"How to Win Friends and Influence People." She did have one nude scene
in the movie, which she passed with flying colors.</P>
<P>The film turns into a series of questions: Whose side is the
karate-skilled, mystery girl really on? Is she on Corso's side? Balkan's
side? Her own side? But the more pertinent question is, will Balkan get
Satan's powers by getting all the books?</P>
<P>There are more things to like about this film than dislike. For
starters, I was impressed by Depp's subdued performance, it gave his
character credibility and even though he wasn't an ethical character, he
made himself more palatable as the film progressed and he seemed to
become more of a victim than someone who is uncaringly in this deal for
just a windfall profit. He had a healthy detachment from the subject
matter of the book (just like the director was detached from the
storyline), as he unwittingly uncovers various reasons people like to
collect occult books. Then there is Langella, who is able to give a
masterfully threatening performance, as someone not satisfied with all
his possessions but who is after the power of the Devil. Satan shows up
not in a materialized form for him, but through his inner being. He is
more scary when he is offering his kindness (money) to Depp than any use
of a special-effect externalization of the devil could have been.</P>
<P>I was also impressed by the way Darius Khondji's cinematography took me
around Europe, into castles, private library collections,
voyeuristically looking into dark corners, and into a devil worship
ceremony. It was shot largely by using a wide-angled lens, always
pointing to interesting shots of dark corridors, or of villages that had
a strangely beautiful feel toward them. I felt I was transported into
the world of book collectors, hearing them converse and seeing what
makes them want to be collectors, and how some are merely pretenders and
some real lovers of books.</P>
<P>The film, unfortunately, ultimately suffered from an undue silliness and
how it ended by fading out to a glowing white screen, as if that is
supposed to mean something special, did not work for me. Unless, it is
meant solely as Polansky's private joke that all this devil worship is
nonsense in the first place, and by ending on a blank note, all he is
doing is telling the audience that there is nothing to see. If there's a
more metaphysical message, it wasn't conveyed to me by the film. But,
that aside, I still maintain that this picaresque film adapted from
Arturo Perez-Reverte's popular Spanish novel El Club Dumas is better
than most satanic thrillers, especially those recent ones relying on
blood and gore to shock the viewer. Here, the director is mostly
spoofing the conventions of horror movies and it is his very personal
humor that should be appreciated, along with the brilliance he brings to
the screen with his filmmaking ability.</P>
<P>The Satan worshippers' annual meeting on Torchia's birthday is a good
example of what I mean by the director's brand of malevolent humor being
on display, seeing how the wannabes in satanism are cloaked in black and
using mumbo jumbo to summon up Satan, as Langella boldly enters their
ceremony and calls them all fools and shouts, "Boo!" We then see them
run for cover. That is the joke Polansky is having with the audience. It
is similar in intention to what Stanley Kubrick's black mass orgiastic
gathering in Eyes Wide Shut, accomplished. Both these ritualized
ceremonies should not be looked at without seeing  them for the farces
they are in the eyes of each filmmaker.</P>
<P>Polansky has crafted a metaphysical suspense film that is more
lightheaded than scary, which might disappoint some but should not take
away from the many pleasures derived from this engrossing thriller.</P>
