<P>     Tom Noonan's 1994 debut, WHAT HAPPENED WAS=85, remains one of the=20
creepiest, most incisive motion pictures ever made about a first date. =20
It's a strange, disturbing piece that focuses on two characters trying,=20
and failing, to connect during an intimate evening.  Now, some two years=20
later, Noonan is back with THE WIFE, an equally edgy drama about how an=20
unplanned dinner party tears at the fabric of a pair of unstable=20
marriages.</P>
<P>     The setup is reasonably simple.  We are introduced to Jack (Noonan)=20
and his wife, Rita (Julie Hagerty), a pair of New Age therapists whose=20
marriage is on the rocks -- they are profoundly incompatible and=20
uncommunicative.  One snowy night, they are visited at their secluded=20
New York state demesne by one of their patients, Cosmo (Wallace Shawn),=20
who has brought his wife, Arlie (Karen Young), to meet his therapists. =20
When the spirited Arlie decides to invite herself and her husband to=20
dinner, the stage is set for all sorts of revelations.</P>
<P>     Despite the inclusion of some low-key comedy, THE WIFE is basically=20
a claustrophobic downer (although not as claustrophobic as WHAT HAPPENED=20
WAS=85).  In addition to dissecting the lives of his four main characters,=
=20
Noonan rips into therapists in general and New Age therapists in=20
particular.  This is not a nice, "touchy-feely" film about people being=20
healed by getting in touch with their inner selves. Instead, it's about=20
damaged men and women trapped in dysfunctional relationships. =20</P>
<P>     The script keenly observes various elements of human nature, and=20
numerous scenes are startling in the clarity and intelligence with which=20
the characters are presented.  On the other hand, Noonan has a tendency=20
to write pretentious dialogue, and certain passages are cluttered with=20
needless verbiage.  For the most part, the intimate moments work; those=20
that concentrate on globally philosophical issues tend to sputter.</P>
<P>     Karen Young, who has had small parts in a number of major studio=20
features, is explosive as the unpredictable Arlie, and, in many ways,=20
her vivacity holds the film together.  Wallace Shawn is his usual steady=20
self as a neurotic, nearly-"normal" man who "can't go on" with his=20
marriage as it is.  Noonan, with a quietly-intense, almost-sinister=20
performance, paints an unsettling portrait of Jack as someone who=20
derives sadistic pleasure from probing open emotional wounds.  Julie=20
Hagerty, better known for comic roles (AIRPLANE, WHAT ABOUT BOB?), plays=20
a woman who craves closeness with an aloof husband.</P>
<P>     The technical and visual aspects of THE WIFE engage the attention. =20
Noonan constantly toys with odd camera angles, distorted perspectives,=20
and shots involving reflected images.  One scene has characters viewed=20
through a window overlapping those reflected in it.  Another uses=20
mirrors to depict two physically-distanced conversations in the same=20
frame.  As in WHAT HAPPENED WAS=85, lighting is used to great effect.  On=20
one occasion, the light from a flickering fire playing on Jack's=20
features gives him a demonic appearance.</P>
<P>     With its echoes of WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOLFE? and its use of=20
the European style of moving the story forward through dialogue rather=20
than action (this could almost be Eric Rohmer at his grimmest), THE WIFE=20
consistently challenges viewers.  It stumbles occasionally (sometimes=20
noticeably), and isn't as hypnotizing as WHAT HAPPENED WAS=85, but many of=
=20
Noonan's observations about how men and women interact are on-target. =20
By turns uncomfortable and fascinating, THE WIFE offers a unique=20
perspective of the age-old institution of marriage. =20</P>
