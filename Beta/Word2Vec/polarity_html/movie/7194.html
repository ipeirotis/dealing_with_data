<P>     While watching LIAR LIAR, it occurred to me that the chief problem 
with this film is that it has a script.  If Jim Carrey had been 
unleashed without such silly, incidental constraints as plot and 
dialogue, who knows where things might have gone?  As it is, however, 
Carrey is forced to confine his antics to the needs of LIAR LIAR's 
unimaginative screenplay, and the results are mixed.  There are times 
when Carrey is excruciatingly funny, but, on those occasions when he's 
expected to do anything remotely approaching "real" acting, his 
limitations become abundantly clear.</P>
<P>     LIAR LIAR is the latest in a long line of movies to skewer lawyers.  
In this case, the assumption is that it's impossible for an attorney to 
get through the day without resorting to all sorts of lies and half-
truths.  For a nation that has just endured more than a year's worth of 
O.J. Simpson-related testimony, this idea has a great deal of resonance.  
So, although a smartly-written satire about this subject could be 
immensely satisfying, that film is *not* LIAR LIAR.  As directed by 
physical comedy specialist Tom Shadyac (ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE, THE 
NUTTY PROFESSOR), this outing is designed for one purpose only -- as a 
showcase for Jim Carrey.  The potential richness of the premise is 
irrelevant.</P>
<P>     Carrey plays (and I use that word loosely) Fletcher Reede, a slick-
talking lawyer whose over-the-top court performances have earned him 
numerous unexpected victories.  When an airheaded bimbo (Jennifer 
Tilley) wants Fletcher's law firm to handle a lucrative-but-difficult 
divorce case, Fletcher is all too eager to oblige.  Unlike some of his 
cohorts, he doesn't have an ethical problem with lying in court, and 
lies, he believes, will win this case.  His predatory boss (Amanda 
Donohoe), aware of his ability, tells him that if he comes out on top 
this time, he'll be made a partner. </P>
<P>     Meanwhile, Fletcher's five-year old son, Max (Justin Cooper), is 
celebrating his birthday.  When Fletcher calls to say that he won't be 
able to make the party (just another in a long history of no-shows), Max 
is crushed.  Then, with the candles on his cake beckoning to be blown 
out, he gets an idea and, as his breath extinguishes their light, Max 
makes a wish that his father will be unable to tell a lie for twenty-
four hours.  The wish comes true and suddenly Fletcher finds himself 
forced to speak the truth on a day when the ability to lie is critical.</P>
<P>     The comic apex of LIAR LIAR comes two-thirds of the way into the 
film, during a board room meeting where Fletcher bluntly and hilariously 
tells each of his co-workers what he really thinks of them.  Several of 
the court scenes are equally funny, with Carrey investing so much zany 
energy that it's almost impossible not to laugh.  There's no denying 
that the actor is a gifted physical comic, and his fans will almost 
certainly be pleased by what he has accomplished here.  </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, there is a dramatic element to this story, and 
that's where Carrey stumbles.  LIAR LIAR is a would-be tale of 
redemption -- its ultimate goal is to reunite a changed Fletcher with 
his son and ex-wife (Maura Tierney, from NBC's NEWS RADIO).  That aspect 
of the film doesn't really work, however, because Carrey's lack of range 
has us snickering almost as much at his attempts to be serious as at his 
most outrageous comic moments.  As a result, LIAR LIAR comes across as a 
series of manic explosions connected together by mush.  </P>
<P>     All-in-all, LIAR LIAR is pretty good fun, and it represents one of 
Carrey's most entertaining movies to date.  (Could he -- gasp -- be 
growing on me?)  The comic is in top form, both in the material that 
made it into the picture and during the end-credit outtakes (which, in 
many ways, are funnier).  And it's delightful to watch performers like 
Amanda Donohoe and helium-voiced Jennifer Tilley struggle to keep their 
composure when Carrey does something exceptionally goofy.  In the past, 
I have said that I generally prefer Jim Carrey in small doses.  This may 
be the exception.  Without him, LIAR LIAR would have been an 
unforgivably bad movie.  With him, it's a mediocre film peppered with 
amusing highlights.  And, honestly, I think that just about says all 
that needs to be said about Gentleman Jim's followup to THE CABLE GUY.</P>
