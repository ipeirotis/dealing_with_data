<P>     In many ways, the story behind the making of GO FISH, Rose Troche
and Guinevere Turner's girl-meets-girl lesbian love story, is as
interesting as the actual film.  This is certainly not a case of a
low-budget independent movie flowing smoothly until the rights are
bought by a distributor.  At times, internal strife threatened to bring
filming to a halt (Troche and Turner, lovers at the beginning of the
production, ended their personal relationship halfway through), and
finding money was always a problem.  The cast and crew, many of whom
are lesbians, worked for free.  By the time the Samuel Goldwyn Company
won the bidding war for the rights to the film (following this year's
Sundance Film Festival), Troche and Turner were deep in debt.</P>
<P>     In formulating this movie, the two women had two primary goals in
mind:  present a good, entertaining movie about lesbians, and have some
fun doing it.  Said Troche, "It's important for a first feature: Make
it simple, do something you know.  And a lot of it came so purely from
what we wanted to see--a film that, as two lesbians, we would be
really excited to see."</P>
<P>     The story focuses on Max (Turner), a "single lesbo looking for
love," and the unlikely candidate of her affections, Ely (V. S.
Brodie).  While Max is a cute, lively, and energetic young woman, Ely
is reserved, self-conscious, and not especially attractive.  (Max's
first reaction is to call her "U. G. L. Y.  She ain't go no alibi.")
Nevertheless, there is a connection between them, and the better part
of GO FISH is spent exploring their tentative overtures towards
romance.</P>
<P>     The characters that surround Max and Ely are almost as interesting
as the two principals.  There's Kia (T. Wendy McMillan), the
intellectual eldest member of the sapphic circle (she kiddingly tells
Max, "I was a dyke while you were in diapers"); her lover Evy (Migdalia
Melendez), who gets kicked out of her house when her mother learns of
her sexual leanings; and the promiscuous Daria (Anastasia Sharp), who
seems to have slept with just about everyone, including (*gasp*) a
man.</P>
<P>     The basic subject material is, of course, nothing new.  But the
unique and humorous spin that Troche and Turner place on it, is.  GO
FISH is a thoroughly engaging motion picture with a touching romance
and a great deal of humorous commentary.</P>
<P>     That commentary is provided by GO FISH's version of a Greek
chorus:  Kia, Evy, Daria, and Daria's lover-of-the-moment.  The four
lie on the floor and speak directly to the camera, giving a witty
play-by-play of the latest goings-on in Max and Ely's courtship.  In a
more polished movie, this technique might seem inappropriate, but in
the context of the grainy, black-and-white GO FISH, it works just
fine.</P>
<P>     The film certainly isn't a technical masterpiece.  The quality of
the 35 mm blowup print varies from adequate to poor, the sound
occasionally isn't synchronized with the picture, and the "arty" edits
employed by Rose Troche confuse as often as they provide an effective
transition.  Some of the acting is wooden (as might be expected from
amateurs) and more than a few lines of dialogue come across as
stilted.  When was the last time you heard someone use "facilitate" in
a sentence, as in "Why don't you facilitate a relationship for me?"</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, Troche and Turner have achieved their aim--GO FISH
is the most enjoyable and entertaining gay/lesbian film to come along
in a few years.  It is heartfelt, able and willing to see the humor in
almost any situation, and avoids a preachy or condescending tone.  This
is a modern romance of the sort that Hollywood is afraid to touch.
Fortunately, there are filmmakers like Troche and Turner who are
determined to make and distribute a GO FISH, no matter what obstacles
stand in their way.</P>
