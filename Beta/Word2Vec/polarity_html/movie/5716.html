<P>     Next to INDEPENDENCE DAY, TRAINSPOTTING may be the most hyped 
motion picture of the summer.  Miramax Films, the distributor that 
saturated the market with ads for THE CRYING GAME in 1992-93 and PULP 
FICTION in '94, has struck again.  TRAINSPOTTING, which is based on 
Irvine Welsh's cult novel and is directed by SHALLOW GRAVE helmsman 
Danny Boyle, became a smash hit in the UK during its run there.  
Miramax, hoping for a similar reaction on this side of the Atlantic, has 
been shouting from the rooftops, using big, splashy print ads and 
chaotic TV and theatrical spots to lure in their target audience.  The 
danger is, of course, that TRAINSPOTTING's substance will get drowned by 
the marketing. </P>
<P>     "I chose not to choose life.  I chose to choose something else," 
says the film's narrator and main character, a twenty-something 
Edinburgh man named Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), near the outset of 
TRAINSPOTTING.  In rejecting the yuppie culture of a nuclear family, 
material possessions, a paying job, and dental insurance, Renton is 
rebelling, but this isn't just the usual disaffection of youth -- it's a 
deeper, more pervasive dissatisfaction with a culture he views as sick 
and stifling. </P>
<P>     Renton's escape is through drugs -- primarily heroin, but really 
anything he can get his hands on.  He's surrounded by his "buddies", a 
group of crooks, liars, and psychos who are even more twisted than he 
is.  There's Spud (Ewan Bremner), a shy, inoffensive junkie; Sick Boy 
(Jonny Lee Miller), a vicious, duplicitous con artist who's obsessed 
with Sean Connery; Tommy (Kevin McKidd), a "virtuous" young man fighting 
the temptation of heroin; and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), a nutcase who 
gets his thrills from beating up people.   </P>
<P>     TRAINSPOTTING is careful not to present a one-sided view of drug 
use.  After all, why would anyone use the stuff if all it leads to is 
misery and unhappiness?  In Renton's words, to get an idea of what it's 
like using heroin, "Take the best orgasm you've ever had, multiply by 
1000, and you're still nowhere near it."  There are no worries about the 
problems and concerns of everyday life, just where the next hit is going 
to come from.  The giddiness of heroin addiction is well-illustrated 
during some of the film's early scenes, but it's a euphoria that gives 
way to tragedy. </P>
<P>     In the end, TRAINSPOTTING has an anti-drug message, but it presents 
its case through character studies, not preaching.  There are a lot of 
gruesome images, some of which are presented in an oddly humorous 
context.  For example, take Renton's headfirst dive into the "worst 
toilet in Scotland" or Spud's reaction when he wakes up in soiled 
sheets.  In portraying the cycle of addiction -- using drugs, trying to 
get clean, then giving in again -- TRAINSPOTTING recalls DRUGSTORE 
COWBOY and THE BASKETBALL DIARIES.  Boyle's style, however, is 
distinctly his own.  This is a kinetic movie, where everything, 
including the camera, keeps moving.  This isn't an examination of the 
Scottish drug culture from the outside looking in, it's one from the 
inside looking out. </P>
<P>     For one hour, TRAINSPOTTING is as compelling as any motion picture 
to be released this year.  It's exciting, energetic, thought-provoking, 
and never lets up.  Unfortunately, during the film's last third, the 
focus starts to shift, and, in doing so, it blurs.  Suddenly, after 
battling addiction for sixty minutes, Renton and his friends become 
Scotland's answer to Quentin Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS -- a group of 
inept thieves committing the "dodgiest scam" in a lifetime of petty 
crimes.  There's mistrust, betrayal, and bloodshed.  But, while this 
material has some appeal, it's debatable whether it belongs here.  For a 
segment like this to really work, it needs more time and attention than 
Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge are able to give it.  As such, the 
subplot seems almost like an afterthought, taking the film away from its 
darker, more compelling material and opening the door to a hopeful, if 
ironic, ending. </P>
<P>     The overlong epilogue aside, TRAINSPOTTING is one of the summer's 
most arresting motion pictures, and not just because of the offbeat 
visual style.  There's nothing new or unique about the story, but it is 
presented in a manner that reinforces its immediacy and impact.  The 
film makers were determined to make this a street-level view of 
addiction, not some "voyeuristic Oxbridge graduate's perception of these 
people".  In that goal, they have succeeded, and, while TRAINSPOTTING is 
not without its faults, it offers a powerful portrait that all of 
Miramax's overhyping cannot diminish. </P>
