<P>     In the world of animated feature films, only one production
company has managed to come close to the standard set by Disney--the
one headed by Don Bluth.  From AN AMERICAN TAIL to THUMBELINA, Bluth's
movies have been second only to the studio under which he made his
name.  The success of THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and
ALADDIN has brought an upsurge in animated motion pictures, most of
which (ONCE UPON A FOREST and WE'RE BACK: A DINOSAUR'S STORY) border on
unwatchable.  Fortunately, THUMBELINA breaks this non-Disney trend,
presenting a theatrical experience that is lively and enjoyable for
both children and adults.</P>
<P>     As her name indicates, Thumbelina (voice of Jodi Benson) is about
the size of a finger.  She lives a generally happy day-to-day life with
her human mother and several animal friends, but something is
missing--until she meets Cornelius (voice of Gary Imhoff), the Fairy
Prince.  One day, while out riding his bumblebee, Cornelius overhears
Thumbelina singing.  Circumstances bring the two together, and they are
instantly smitten with each other.  But before Cornelius can propose
marriage, Thumbelina is stolen away by a gruesome toad who also wants
her for his wife.</P>
<P>     Disneys animated movies have a threefold strength:  the quality of
the animation, the energy of the songs, and the clarity of the plot.
In all of these areas, THUMBELINA is close, but not quite up to the
level of THE LITTLE MERMAID, the weakest of Disney's recent entries.
Actually, THE LITTLE MERMAID comparison comes easily--both are tales
of young women striving for, and finding, love with a prince; and Jodi
Benson provides the voices of the heroines for both films.</P>
<P>     The animation is crisp and visually striking, with careful
attention paid to details--a trademark of both Bluth and Disney.
Thumbelina is perhaps not as completely-realized as Arielle, Belle, or
Jasmine, but she's far better drawn than the women populating all the
fringe big-screen cartoons.  The same can be said of the other
characters, most of whom are animals, and none of which embarrass their
creators.</P>
<P>     Barry Manilow's music isn't as immediately recognizable as that of
Alan Menken, but he does manage a worthy tune or two.  One song in
particular, "Let Me Be Your Wings", co-written by Manilow with Bruce
Sussman and Jack Feldman (who partnered with Menken for Disney's
live-action NEWSIES), is a standout, and every bit the equal of BEAUTY
AND THE BEAST's title track or ALADDIN's "A Whole New World."</P>
<P>     The storyline of THUMBELINA, adapted from the popular Hans
Christian Andersen fable, is relatively uncomplicated, and makes
excellent material for an animated romance/adventure.  There are
several occasions when the plot seems rushed, especially towards the
end.  While children most likely won't notice this, adults will,
although it shouldn't detract much from anyone's enjoyment of the
film.</P>
<P>The vocal talents of several well-known actors are made use of in
THUMBELINA.  John Hurt, the veteran British performer, supplies the
very proper voice of Mr. Mole.  Carol Channing is Ms. Fieldmouse.  And
Gilbert Gottfried, who stole his share of scenes as Iago in ALADDIN,
plays an acid-tongued beetle.</P>
<P>Entertainment comes in many forms, and THUMBELINA is among the
frothiest available.  But the best thing is that not only is it fun--an
eminently watchable--but it's a perfect "family film," capable of
pleasing both children and their parents.  With the exception of Disney
fare, this has become an increasingly-rare commodity, and when an
opportunity such as this occurs, it should be taken advantage of.</P>
