<P>     THE SWEET HEREAFTER is film maker Atom Egoyan's most compelling 
movie to date.  Amplifying many of the themes explored in his previous 
outing, EXOTICA, the Canadian director/writer/producer shows the 
powerful effects of grief and anger on a community devastated by an 
unspeakable tragedy.  During the course of this 110-minute, emotionally-
turbulent experience, Egoyan doesn't ask any easy questions or propose 
any pat answers.  This is film making at its most powerful:  drama 
capable of shaking the soul, yet free of even the slightest hint of 
manipulation, sentimentality, or mawkishness.  The movie has an impact 
that extends far beyond the walls of a movie theater – a quality shared 
by a distressingly few of today's releases.</P>
<P>     Egoyan began making films with 1984's NEXT OF KIN, a critical 
success that earned him a nomination for Canada's Best Director Genie 
Award.  He followed NEXT OF KIN with FAMILY VIEWING, SPEAKING PARTS, THE 
ADJUSTER, and CALENDAR, all of which shared certain common traits, 
including a wildly elliptical style, themes of emotional isolation, and 
a degree of distance between the characters and the audience.  Egoyan's 
early movies, although intellectually stimulating and fascinating to 
observe from a critical standpoint, were emotionally dissatisfying.  
However, the director's next effort, the much-lauded EXOTICA, broke down 
the character/audience barrier, and, at the time, proved to be Egoyan's 
most challenging effort.  Yet, as forceful as EXOTICA was, it was only 
an appetizer for THE SWEET HEREAFTER.</P>
<P>     As with all of the other Egoyan-directed movies, THE SWEET 
HEREAFTER involves more than one storyline, although the internal 
connections are less oblique here than in the previous features.  This 
could easily be viewed as Egoyan's most commercial work thus far. It is 
certainly his most accessible.  There are those who would equate words 
like "commercial" and "accessible" with the term "creative compromise," 
but nothing could be further from the truth.  Although Egoyan's methods 
may have become more mainstream, his message is richer and more complex 
than ever.</P>
<P>     The central event of THE SWEET HEREAFTER is a school bus accident 
that results in the death of fourteen children and the injury of many 
others.  On a cold winter's day in the small town of Sam Dent, British 
Columbia, the driver loses control of the vehicle and it careens off the 
road onto a frozen lake which gives way beneath the weight.  The scene 
of the bus sinking into the water – a stark, simple shot – is one of the 
most painfully effective and disturbing sequences in any film this year.  
The impact is further enhanced by presenting the fatal moment from the 
perspective of an impotent father.  Death has become such a cheap, 
bloody commodity in modern movies that viewing a scene like this is a 
revelation. </P>
<P>     Since Egoyan eschews linear storytelling by allowing time to be 
fluid rather than fixed, we don't see the actual accident until midway 
through the movie.  The opening scene introduces us to Mitchell Stephens 
(Ian Holm), an ambulance-chaser who has come to Sam Dent to persuade the 
victims' parents to join in a class action lawsuit.  He promises 
financial compensation for their losses, claiming that while no one can 
offer an outlet for their grief, he can be the voice of their anger.  In 
fact, Mitchell knows something about those emotions.  His daughter, Zoe 
(Caerthan Banks), is a drug addict on the road to self-destruction.  All 
of the fury bubbling within Mitchell becomes focused into his work in 
Sam Dent.  But there is no clear culprit to sue for the bus accident, 
and Mitchell is groping for a villain who doesn't exist.  Parents join 
him in the vain hope that money will soothe the pain or bring some sort 
of "closure," but the greed for compensation fractures the community.</P>
<P>     Other players in the drama include Nicole Burnell (Sarah Polley), 
one of the accident survivors.  She's a teenage, would-be rock star who 
loses the use of her legs because of the experience, and who becomes the 
corner stone of Mitchell's case.  As the victim of incest, however, she 
is a damaged individual.  Her parents, Sam (Tom McCamus) and Mary 
(Brooke Johnson), are among the lawyer's most eager clients.  Two others 
involved in the suit are Wanda and Hartley Otto (Arsinee Khanjian and 
Earl Pastko), who lost an adopted child in the crash.  Risa and Wendell 
Walker (Alberta Watson and Maury Chaykin), whose only son perished 
beneath the cold waters, have also signed with Mitchell.  But Risa's 
lover, Billy Ansell (Bruce Greenwood), reject's Mitchell's advances.  
Having recently lost his wife, Billy is acquainted with grief, and this 
enables him to accept the death of his twin children, rather than wallow 
in denial.  Finally, there's Dolores Driscoll (Gabrielle Rose), the 
longtime bus driver who must live with the weight of responsibility for 
what happened.</P>
<P>     THE SWEET HEREAFTER is based on the novel by Russell Banks, but 
Egoyan has infused it with his own inimitable style.  One of the film 
maker's more successful innovations is to make explicit comparisons 
between the situation in Sam Dent (the loss of the children) and the one 
in the Robert Browning poem, "The Pied Piper of Hamelin."  In the "Pied 
Piper," the lone crippled boy left behind by the Piper forever regretted 
his exclusion from a land where "everything was strange and new."  It 
could be argued that, in THE SWEET HEREAFTER, the abandoned one is 
Nicole.  The sweet hereafter is the strange, new land that her 
schoolmates reach, but which she has not yet attained.</P>
<P>     The most intriguing character is Mitchell.  The best-developed of 
all of THE SWEET HEREAFTER's numerous multifaceted individuals, Mitchell 
proves to be a sympathetic figure even though his influence is negative.  
The lawyer is not only after a quick buck (he gets 1/3 of the proceeds 
from any favorable settlement), but he believes that his own tragedy 
forges an emotional link between him and the residents of Sam Dent.  
What he can't see, however, is that his private agenda is tearing 
asunder the fabric of the community.  Personal demons and an obsession 
to assuage his own guilt, not a need to see justice done, drive 
Mitchell.</P>
<P>     As always, Egoyan has assembled a top-notch cast.  Ian Holm paints 
a powerful and stirring portrait of Mitchell as a haunted, hurting 
figure whose inner torment touches our hearts.  Holm acts with his eyes 
and face, as well as with his voice and actions.  The actor's shining 
moment is when Mitchell relates the story of how, as an infant, his 
daughter nearly died from a spider bite.  It is during this scene, more 
than any other, that the audience truly connects with a character that, 
under other circumstances, might be worthy of disdain.</P>
<P>     Most of the other performers are Egoyan regulars.  As always, the 
director's wife, Arsinee Khanjian, is on hand.  Bruce Greenwood, playing 
a role not unlike the one he essayed in EXOTICA, is again a grieving 
father.  Sarah Polley, who was also in EXOTICA (she was a babysitter), 
has a more complex role here.  In addition to portraying Nicole, Polley 
contributes the vocals to many of the songs heard throughout the film, 
including the one that plays over the closing credits.  Other familiar 
faces from previous Egoyan features include Gabrielle Rose, Maury 
Chaykin, and David Hemblen (as Dolores the bus driver's husband).  
Alberta Watson, who made a strong impression as the mother in SPANKING 
THE MONKEY, is Risa Walker.</P>
<P>     One of the many tangential aspects of THE SWEET HEREAFTER is to 
illustrate the shallowness of the numerous John Grisham movies.  
Compared to Egoyan's thoughtful and potent examination of the role of a 
lawyer in society, even THE RAINMAKER, the best adaptation of a Grisham 
novel to date, seems flat and unconvincing.  Egoyan has given us a 
powerful motion picture that resonates on every level.  The most amazing 
thing about THE SWEET HEREAFTER is not the style, the acting, or the 
cinematography (all of which are exceptional), but the way the film 
successfully juggles so many themes, persuading us to reflect upon them 
all before the 110 minute running time is up.  This is truly a great 
film – easily one of 1997's best.</P>
