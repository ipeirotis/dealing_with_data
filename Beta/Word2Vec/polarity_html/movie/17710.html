<PRE>
 10 Things I Hate About You (1999) 2 stars out of 4. Starring Julia Stiles
and Heath Ledger</PRE>
<P> "10 Things I Hate About You" is a simplified and simplistic adaptation of
Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew."</P>
<P> Set at upscale Padua High School, the story revolves around the Stratford
sisters, Kat and Bianca.</P>
<P> Kat is the school witch, a senior who hates guys and lives by her own
convictions. Bianca is a sophomore, the belle of the school, a popular girl
every guy wants to date.</P>
<P> But there's no catch. As in the original, Bianca can have nothing to do
with the opposite sex until Kat is wooed. In other words, until Kat gets a
date, Bianca must sit at home and wait.</P>
<P> The movie deviates from Shakespeare in several aspects, most notably
giving Kat a valid psychological reason for her disdain of boys.</P>
<P> And while "10 Things I Hate About You" is not as intellectually
stimulating nor as bawdy as the original, it has enough to satisfy young
viewers and give them a sampling of the Bard's wit and style.</P>
<P> A cast of basically unknown young actors breathe life into this 90-plus
minute confection, led by Julia Stiles as Kat and Heath Ledger as Patrick
Verona, the bad-ass student hired to tame "the shrew."</P>
<P> The movie lacks weight. It's a fast-food film, easy to digest, but nothing
remarkable or memorable.</P>
<P> "10 Things I Hate About You" follows in the wake of "Clueless" and "Cruel
Intentions" making the classics palatable for younger audiences. Whether it
stimulates young viewers to the point of actually reading the originals is
problematic.</P>
<P> Older audiences may find the proceedings juvenile, but "10 Things I Hate
About You" is a fun date movie for the under-25 crowd.</P>
<P> The only reason Shakespeare would roll over in his grave is any lack of
credit for inspiring this update. Well, that's Hollywood.</P>
