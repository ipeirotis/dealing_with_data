<P>     When it comes to embracing camp, there's no halfway point.  To be
successful in this arena, a movie must turn its back on even the
semblance of conventionality, expressing everything from the most
insignificant line of dialogue to a climactic event with an irreverence
that would make the Monty Python troupe members offer winks and nudges of
appreciation.  It is because TANK GIRL takes this approach that it
germinates into a high-spirited, madcap example of film making run amok.
Certainly, this movie isn't art, but it sure is fun.</P>
<P>     Film adaptations of comic books have become nearly as prevalent as
those based on Stephen King stories.  In some cases (THE CROW, THE MASK),
they work reasonably well.  In others (TALES FROM THE CRYPT), the results
are disastrous.  None, however, not even Jim Carrey's special effects
tour de force, have gone to the extremes visited by TANK GIRL.  Nothing
is sacred--this movie pushes the envelope as far as it will go, and the
result is an offbeat and energized juxtaposition of action and comedy.
This is the kind of tone that films like HUDSON HAWK, THE LAST ACTION
HERO, and DEMOLITION MAN tried in vain to capture.</P>
<P>     It's the mixture of seeming spontaneity and a total lack of
seriousness that fuels whatever success TANK GIRL has.  The name of the
game is outrageousness, and the script never attempts anything that might
damage it.  There is no characterization to speak of, and the plot is
simply a nonsensical piece of fluff upon which to drape so much excess.
And just when you think things can't get sillier, something happens to
change your mind, whether it's the insertion of oddly-rendered animated
sequences, a bizarre rendition of Cole Porter's "Let's Do It", or Lori
Petty's title character sporting a brassiere that would make Madonna gasp
with envy.</P>
<P>     TANK GIRL takes place in a post-apocalyptic future.  In this
scenario, the Earth-devastating disaster was a comet strike, and it has
left most of the globe in ruins and water in short supply.  There are
three types of survivors:  members of an organization called Water and
Power, small bands of nomads who won't submit to authority, and the
mysterious and deadly Rippers.  Rebecca (Lori Petty), aka "Tank Girl", is
a member of a renegade faction in the Blue Dunes.  When Water and Power
troops arrive, they kill everybody except Rebecca and a little girl
called Sam (Stacy Linn Rawsower).  While the girl is sent to work in a
strip joint, Rebecca is granted a personal audience with Kesslee (Malcolm
McDowell), the leader of Water and Power.</P>
<P>     Kesslee wants Rebecca to join his forces.  When she refuses, she's
put to work in a labor comp.  While looking for a way to escape, Rebecca
meets another ill-treated woman (Naomi Watts).  Together, the pair search
for a way out of Water and Power's fortress while Kesslee plots how to
use Rebecca to uncover the secret entrance to the lair of the Rippers--the
vicious and hitherto untouchable group of "demons" that routinely
slaughter Water and Power troops.</P>
<P>     Given her bleached blond punk hairdo and ever-perky expression, Lori
Petty is an inspired choice for Tank Girl.  She gets all the right
inflections on the one-liners and doesn't know the meaning of the term
"reserve".  Malcolm McDowell, the consummate over-the-top villain,
displays a far more delectable nastiness here than in STAR TREK
GENERATIONS.  This bad guy is someone to root against.  Naomi Watts is
appealing as Tank Girl's sidekick and Ice T is virtually unrecognizable
as the Ripper T-Saint.</P>
<P>     With a breakneck, don't-bother-to-stop-and-think-about-it pace, TANK
GIRL zips along for over one-hundred moments, only occasionally lapsing
from its zaniness.  The rock-and-rap soundtrack, supervised by Courtney
Love-Cobain, invigorates certain scenes, and blends nicely with the
visuals.  Judging by the finished product, it's pretty clear that
director Rachel Talalay achieved her vision.  TANK GIRL is one of those
chew-the-popcorn, munch-the-candy flicks--the kind you go into
expecting to have a good time, but nothing more.  Given those
expectations, disappointment is as unlikely as boredom.</P>
