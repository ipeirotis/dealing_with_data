<PRE>                              THE INSIDER
                    A film review by Mark R. Leeper</PRE>
<PRE>               Capsule: THE INSIDER traces the story of the
          incident in which the big tobacco companies went
          from incredible power to their current huge losing
          streak.  It is told blow by blow (by blow by blow
          by blow).  A former tobacco executive is slowly
          convinced to become a whistle-blower for the CBS
          News "60 Minutes" team.  It shoulda, coulda, woulda
          been exciting, but is told so authentically and in
          such detail that it becomes ponderous, over-long,
          and at times even dull.  Rating: 4 (0 to 10), 0 (-4
          to +4)</PRE>
<P>     I read the NEW YORKER magazine and I enjoy some of their really
in-depth articles about some incident.  They will take some incident
like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what
happened in detail.  It becomes a real education in what agencies get
involved and how theories are suggested, and what kind of pressure the
investigators are under, and just about any other aspect you can think
of.  Frequently I get the feeling that the article sounded exciting,
but I am being told in more detail than I really wanted to know.  Often
I get to the middle of a story and say, OK, it sounded good but I now
have invested more time than I am willing to spend on this subject.
Film is a different medium.  It is a visual medium.  That slows down
the telling of stories much more than people realize.  I frequently am
surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the
pages are empty space.  The magazine article and the film script are
two very different media.  THE INSIDER is a film adaptation of the
Vanity Fair article "The Man Who Knew Too Much" by Marie Brenner.  It
is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a
film.  It really verges on being tedious at least at times.</P>
<P>     For years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an
addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects.  But they
pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really
believe it.  The business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds
translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any
political movements against big tobacco.  The tide turned when a former
vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the CBS 60
Minutes News team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies
really knew about the health effects of smoking.  The resulting
pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at CBS.  Who were
the major people involved, what were their motives, how was the story
almost killed, how did it get aired anyway?  That is the story covered
in surprising detail by THE INSIDER.  This all could have been
enthralling, but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like
Michael Mann would be likely to do well.  And in the end, he failed.
To make a long story short, the film needed a director who knew how to
make a long story short.</P>
<P>     The film opens with the CBS 60 Minutes team in Iran with the
assignment to interview a terrorist.  We get a taste for their personal
style and how they get the upper hand.  They go from being one newsman
blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with
Mike Wallace (played by Christopher Plummer). There the news team under
producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) are ordering around the terrorists
and getting away with it.  This seems to have nothing to do with the
main line of the story, but later when the tobacco industry is so much
harder to manipulate than committed terrorists, we have a wry irony on
who really has clout in the world.  Terrorists can grab the headlines,
but the tobacco companies have the real position of power.</P>
<P>     Incongruously intercut with the Iran interview sequence we see
Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) dejectedly returning from work to his
home.  We discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a
complete halt unexpectedly.  He had been a very profitably rewarded
vice-president in charge or research and development at Brown and
Williams Tobacco; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his
family.  Rather than support him his wife Liane (Diane Venora) demands
of him what are they supposed to do for income.  Meanwhile the 60
Minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have
obtained some data they do not understand.  They offer Wigand $12,000
just to interpret the data.  Wigand's severance agreement swears him to
secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings, but he is
reluctantly he stretches the severance terms.  He is willing to read
some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for
Bergman.  In spite of the secrecy, Wigand's former employers seem
immediately to know Wigand is talking to 60 Minutes and he is warned
off by former boss Thomas Sandefur played Michael Gambon in an all too
brief but deliciously sinister role.  And so the game begins.  Wigand
is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered
continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer.
Meanwhile someone is playing very rough with Wigand and his family.</P>
<P>     The film examines Wigand and the pressures placed on his family as
they are caught between two powerful giants.  Wigand has always wanted
to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story
out.  He and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially
by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight.  Al
Pacino is given top billing but the Wigand family is the core of THE
INSIDER.</P>
<P>     The story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous
detail.  The film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for
the audience.  The musical score by Pieter Bourke, Lisa Gerrard, and
Graeme Revell is one of the worst in recent memory.  It puts ominous
chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a
distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling.  Also disturbing
is the casting of Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace.  Plummer and
Wallace are such different types and Wallace is too well-known for even
so good an actor as Plummer to play him convincingly.</P>
<P>     This film might have been a really engaging experience under
another director's control.  Michael Mann was the wrong person to helm
this film and THE INSIDER lacks intensity because of his style.  I rate
it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
