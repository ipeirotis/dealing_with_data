<PRE>"Why is the price of justice so high?" 
  - Maheude, GERMINAL </PRE>
<P>     GERMINAL, based on the landmark novel by Emile Zola, presents a
startlingly authentic and powerful look into the tumultuous, tragedy-
riddled lives of 19th century French coal miners.  Forced to endure
hellish conditions, risk death and dismemberment, and work from before
dawn until after dusk, these men and women had only one alternative to
mining:  starvation.  GERMINAL is not a happy story, but it is
impossible not to sense the realism that pervades the project.</P>
<P>     The film opens with the arrival of Etienne Lantier (Renaud) at the
Voreux coal mine.  An out-of-work machinist, Etienne is willing to do
almost anything to make money, including descending into the pit and
taking pick-axe to coal.  He is befriended by Maheu (Gerard Depardieu),
who takes him onto his digging crew and invites him to lodge at his
house.  Once there, Etienne becomes enamored with Catherine (Judith
Henry), Maheu's daughter, and she with him--although neither of them
is willing to admit their feelings.</P>
<P>     As the drudgery of working in the mine worsens, and pay is cut
back, Etienne prods Maheu into organizing a strike.  At first peaceful,
it doesn't take long before the labor unrest explodes into violence,
with predictable consequences.</P>
<P>     Director/producer Claude Berri, who is perhaps best known for his
films JEAN DE FLORETTE and MANON OF THE SPRING, has dedicated GERMINAL
to his father, a furrier who toiled for most of his life in factories
and died at the age of 58 from inhaling animal hairs.  Actors Gerard
Depardieu and Miou-Miou participated in this film as tributes to their
own laborer parents.</P>
<P>     In a movie that could easily have become little more than a
platform for damning 19th-Century labor conditions, Berri has breathed
life and vigor into both characters and script.  We are drawn into
GERMINAL, not only by the finely-realized people who inhabit this
world, but by the ability of the cameras to evoke with claustrophobic
authenticity the labyrinthine tunnels of the mines.</P>
<P>     Berri refuses to gloss over the ugliness of what it was like to
work underground, and, in vivid contrast to soot-coated, sweating,
weary men and women trudging through candlelit darkness, he presents
the pampered lives of those who run the mines.  As a strike looms, one
such woman hopes that this unfortunate turn of events won't disrupt her
plans for a lunch party.</P>
<P>     Berri's indictment of plight of the miners is at once simple and
moving.  While Zola's impassioned cry for social reform is at the heart
of GERMINAL, the interactions of the individual characters represent
the picture's soul, and lift it above other movies with similar
messages.</P>
<P>     There is the unconditional love of one man, Maheu, for his family,
and the sacrifices he must endure for them.  Maheu is a hard worker,
and in his heart he believes in the innate goodness of man.  He cannot
accept, for example, that soldiers brought in to defend the mine would
fire on their own countrymen.</P>
<P>     GERMINAL, which cost $30 million to make, is a lavish production,
and it's clear that the money was well-spent.  The scenes in the mine
are remarkable in conveying the desperate circumstances confronting the
characters.  How many members of the audience experienced an irrational
desire to wash away the accumulating coal dust from their own skin?</P>
<P>     Aided in no small part by an exemplary cast, Claude Berri has
brought to the screen a masterpiece, interweaving personal tragedy and
social upheaval against the background of a way of life that would not
yield easily to change.  There is much that is right about GERMINAL,
and very little that is wrong.  When released in France, this film went
toe-to-toe with JURASSIC PARK.  Financial considerations aside, take
one look at this movie, and it will be clear which is the real winner.</P>
