THE CELL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>THE CELL is surrealistic grand opera as choreographed by the Marquis de 
Sade.  As first-time screenwriter Mark Protosevich accurately points out 
in the press kit, he wanted to take the next step beyond THE SILENCE OF 
THE LAMBS.  Even this critic, who generally has an iron constitution 
after years of watching 300 films a year, was squirming in his seat on 
this one.  Taking itself completely seriously, the movie blends science 
fiction technology with an old fashioned hunt for a serial killer and 
his dying last victim.  </P>
<P>The result is an edge-of-the-seat thriller that should have been rated 
NC-17 but was given an R.  Consider THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as your 
personal benchmark.  If it was too much for you, then you do not want to 
see THE CELL.  Other the hand, this is one of the best movies of the 
summer, and you can always close your eyes if you have to.</P>
<P>The story opens in an imaginary landscape as psychologist Catherine 
Deane (Jennifer Lopez) tries to help a young boy, Edward (Colton James), 
break out of his coma.  Through a new transcendental science, she is 
able to work her way into his unconscious mind.  As she and the boy wear 
red-ribbed bodysuits, they are suspended on cables from the ceiling.  
Once up in this contraption, her mind goes into his.  It sounds silly 
and looks a bit ridiculous, but the story shoots for and achieves 
intelligent science-fiction rather than camp.</P>
<P>The majority of the credit for THE CELL should go to first-time feature 
film director Tarsem Singh, who crafts audacious scenes of great visual 
power.  He puts his background as a music video director to work, 
finding inventive and beautiful ways to stage scenes.</P>
<P>Paul Laufer's stunning cinematography, with its dark, oversaturated 
colors, calls to mind another Lopez film, Oliver Stone's U-TURN.  THE 
CELL's striking visuals along with its fantastical costumes absolutely 
mesmerize the viewers.</P>
<P>Even though she had little luck with poor Edward, Catherine is called 
into service by the FBI.  After a dramatic investigation, the FBI, led 
by FBI Agent Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn, CLAY PIGEONS) captures serial 
killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio, Abbie Hoffman in STEAL THIS 
MOVIE!).  But there is a problem.  After putting his last victim into a 
cube slowly filling with water, Carl fell into a coma.  Carl, the doctor 
explains, is "not just catatonic.  He has disappeared."   The doctor 
says that Carl will never regain his consciousness.  This means that, 
unless Catherine can enter his mind and find the location of the torture 
chamber, his last victim will die by nightfall.</P>
<P>Along her terrible journey into the creepy unknown of a schizophrenic's 
mind, we witness a plethora of horrible and beautiful images.  Jake 
Thomas, as the young Carl, is sometimes Catherine's tour guide.  The 
scene of someone's intestines being slowly ripped out is not even the 
worst of many nightmarish incidents that we encounter.  Carl appears a 
malevolent king of his terrifying netherworld.</P>
<P>"Remember, it's not real," one of the institute's scientists (Marianne 
Jean-Baptiste) admonishes someone about to try the machine for the first 
time.  Yeah, right.  It looks pretty scary to the audience, so one can 
just imagine how frightening it would be going inside the head of a 
serial killer.  Nevertheless, the movie makes this voyage completely 
engrossing, like reading a book that you can't put away until you've 
read every page.</P>
<P>Although the movie may make you embarrassed for not having more 
elaborate dreams, it could also have another effect.  It may make you 
wish that the future described in the story would get here sooner.  
Imagine arranging for Jennifer Lopez to appear in your dreams with a 
disk that you could insert into your bed's electronics.  Now that would 
be a movie tie-in worth purchasing.  </P>
<P>THE CELL runs a blazingly fast 1:45.  It is rated R for bizarre violence 
and sexual images, nudity and language,  but it should have been rated 
NC-17.  It would be acceptable for high school seniors and older.</P>
