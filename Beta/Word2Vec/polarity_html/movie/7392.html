--------------------</PRE>
<P>The most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning
side and a losing side. In a nuclear confrontation, everybody loses, and
the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire
world--assuming the world survives. The idea--and perhaps the only real
option--is to avoid war at all costs. This is the theme of Sidney Lumet's
"Fail-Safe," a fictional drama based on the novel by Eugene Burdick and
Harvey Wheeler.</P>
<P>"Fail-Safe" takes place during the heart of the cold war (the actual film
was released two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis), when the United
States and the Soviet Union were in static discord over an issue that can
be summarized in a single word: communism. The premise centers around a
combination of accidents and operation flaws. Five U.S. bombers carrying
nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for Moscow after an
unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward America. The unidentified
aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner, but a mechanical failure
strikes the military base that commands the bombers. Suddenly out of
contact, and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new
directives, the bomber pilots cannot be recalled, and they proceed to
Moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike.</P>
<P>A great deal of "Fail-Safe"'s plot follows various characters as they
attempt to devise ways of stopping the U.S. bombers from reaching Russia's
borders--at any cost. The plot is compelling, and the story creates urgency
and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios. The reality
sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails.
General Bogan (Frank Overton), taking orders directly from the President of
the United States himself (Henry Fonda), is powerless--the fate of the
world lies in the hands of an automated, pre-programmed system that may not
be stoppable, simply because the creators of the war machines were too
efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable. </P>
<P>The events in "Fail-Safe" are fascinating because they're anything but
predictable, but the real reason "Fail-Safe" works is because it
understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of
its plot. A key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing
polemic about nuclear war, communism, the cold war, and the United States'
role in all of it. Most of this is through the film's use of the character
Groeteschele (Walter Matthau), an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear
weapons use who, incidentally, is on the President's advising staff for
analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war.</P>
<P>Many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where
Groeteschele is one of the key voices. Early in the film, he hosts a dinner
party where he explains the importance of "strategy" in a nuclear assault
to "minimize" casualties. "What's the difference between 60 million and 100
million dead?" a guest asks impatiently. "Forty million," Groeteschele
responds wryly. The problem with Groeteschele's mindset is that he
*believes* nuclear combat to be a viable method of war. The only difference
to him between nuclear Armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data
and the casualty totals.</P>
<P>Groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several
times over. Yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to
cool the situation off, as General Black (Dan O'Herlihy) has often
recommended. On the contrary--according to Groeteschele, that would lead to
Russia having *more* nuclear weapons than the U.S., which would clearly put
America at a disadvantage. Such a stance was perhaps the central paradox
and misguided practice of the arms race. "Fail-Safe" clearly sees it as one
of the central issues of the cold war, and, likewise, it becomes a central
theme in the film. Why continue to build such machines of mass destruction
while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times
over? Is it wise? Is it even logical? No, not really.</P>
<P>Although "Fail-Safe" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is
about the political ramifications of communism, there is a scene in the
film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial, one-sided
sort of way. Again, this is achieved through Groeteschele, who is easily
the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme
significance. In addition to providing the central "pro-nuclear war" voice
that the film warns against, he also makes key remarks about Communists
that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone
to when it came to communism. The context the film uses suggests that this
hatred was often glib. One of Groeteschele's "logical" trains of thought
ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely
absurd. He labels the average Marxist an "unfeeling, calculating machine"
that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself. Groeteschele takes it so
far as to say that if the U.S. drops the warhead on Moscow, the Soviets
will *instantly* surrender, for to retaliate would invite counter-measures
that would further destroy Russia's home soil--which must be preserved at
all costs. Groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with
emotions; General Black quickly reminds him that the Soviets would attack
out of revenge--as any normal person would. The irony here is
Groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing. He is so quick to judge the enemy
that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns.</P>
<P>Once the film makes it evident that turning the U.S. bombers will be
impossible, the question becomes what the *consequences* of destroying
Moscow will be. Just how will the Soviet Union's leader react, and what can
the President do to convey his best intentions? (Just *how* does one pass
off the deaths of millions of people as an *mishap*?) With the help of his
translator Buck (Larry Hagman), the President negotiates at length with the
Soviet leader, in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their
simplicity, with Lumet's long takes of Fonda and Hagman in the same frame,
exchanging the dialog between the President and the Soviet leader. Without
getting into too much detail, I will say that the compromise they
ultimately reach is very costly, yet necessary and as sensible as possible
under the circumstances. (That is, as sensible as a nuclear "incident" can
probably be.) It does accomplish what it must: it avoids an all-out war,
something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real
consequences. Dramatically, the ending is quite powerful, and the use of
O'Herlihy's character as the symbolic "matador" (providing a bookend to the
film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the
film's opening), is particularly appropriate.</P>
<P>"Fail-Safe" is a production of a major Hollywood studio (released by
Columbia Pictures), and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense
thriller that one might expect from a Hollywood film. Nevertheless, under
Lumet's direction and Walter Bernstein's intelligent adaptation of
Burdick's and Wheeler's novel, the film continues to have a lasting effect
even after the events on screen have unfolded. The film often warns that
the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an
unintentional consequence of such mass arming. But it was the conscious,
human choice to *initialize* this automatic arming that "Fail-Safe" also
finds dangerous. In retrospect, the arms race seems to be one of the most
puzzling exercises in futility of the century. It's just fortunate that
both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down, rather
than continuing Groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and
causing a possible meltdown.</P>
