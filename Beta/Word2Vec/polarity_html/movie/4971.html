<PRE>                             THE LOVER (L'AMANT)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     THE LOVER (L' AMANT) (1991) is an English language film set in
1929 French Indo-China (Vietnam).  It is a highly atmospheric and, some
would say, erotic tale of two sad and lonely people.  The message of
the film appears to be that we are trapped and life is hopeless.</P>
<P>     Based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Maugerite Dumas, the
film tells the tale of a 15 1/2 year girl.  The girl (Jane March) is
called only "the young girl" by the narrator known as "the writer"
(Yvonne Wingerter in the beginning and Raymonde Heudeline in the end).
The girl leaves her home to go to a boarding school.  While on the
ferry she meets a lonely and depressed rich man known as "the Chinaman"
(Tony Leung Ka Fai).  He offers to driver her to her boarding school in
his large limo.</P>
<P>     Although the Chinaman is filthy rich, only 31 years old, and
handsome enough to be a fashion model, he has little confidence and
looks so sad you think he is about slash his wrists at any moment.  The
young girl seems suffering from clinical depression as well.  When the
man says it is his fault, she corrects him, saying, "It's me.  I am
always a little sad.  I'm like my mother."  Actually, everyone in the
movie seemed to suffer from major depression.</P>
<P>     In an attempt, I guess, to find meaning in their life, the two
protagonists spend over half of the movie with their clothes off and
most of this time is spent doing sex.  The sex is certainly not erotic
and is mainly exhausting.  They don't seem to enjoy any of it and
watching them do it is about as much fun as watching athletes doing one
wind sprint after another to get in shape for a track meet.  I saw the
videotape version where scenes deleted so that could get an R rating
were added back in.  I suspect the movie was better in the released
theatrical version.</P>
<P>     Jane March, whose only other film was COLOR OF NIGHT, shows little
acting ability.  COLOR OF NIGHT was number one on my worst films of
1994 list, and she showed a lack of talent in that movie as well.  Tony
Leung Ka Fai shows promise, but the maudlin script (Jean-Jacques Annaud
and Gerard Brach) with which he has to deal left he little room to
maneuver.  The worst part of the dialog is given to the writer.  She
has to say one pedantic line after another, and overall, the narrator's
part is just too wordy.  Director Jean-Jacques Annaud has the actors
pause frequently in their dialog so the audience can fully ponder the
drivel they have just uttered.</P>
<P>     Actually, the best part of the movie is some wonderful
cinematography (Robert Fraisse) that has a sepia tone look to it.  This
is complimented by sets (Thanh At Hoang) of great and natural beauty.
The lushness of the jungle and especially of the rivers is complimented
by buildings of old brown stone.  The film transports you to a long ago
era and makes you feel as if you are there.  Now if you could just get
rid of those actors and actresses populating the scenery, ...</P>
<P>     THE LOVER runs 1:50.  It is rated R for non-stop sex and nudity.
There is no violence.  The film would be fine for most teenagers.
Although I can not recommend this depressing film, I did like some of
the technical aspects so I am giving it * 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
