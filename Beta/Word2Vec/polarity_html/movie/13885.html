Susan Granger's review of "A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES" (October Films)</P>
<P>Kaylie Jones writes about what she knows. In this fictionalized
autobiography, the daughter of James Jones, who wrote "From Here to
Eternity y" and "The Thin Red Line," details what it was like to grow
up bilingual in the late '60s and '70s in Paris, inhabiting two
disparate cultures yet not totally comfortable in either. Her
expatriate parents were obviously conflicted about America and France,
and they passed that ambivalence on to their children. There's the
adolescent girl (Leelee Sobieski), her novelist father (Kris
Kristofferson), free-spirited mother (Barbara Hershey), and adopted
French brother (Jesse Bradford). Plus her best friend (Anthony Roth
Costanzo), an artistic, sensitive soul who sings opera in a lilting
soprano. Then, when her father's heart disease propels a move to Long
Island, there's a whole new set of emotional conflicts as she
comes-of-age in a sexually liberal, unrepressed home. Curiously, it's
the idiosyn= cratic, anecdotal story, adapted by James Ivory and Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala,not the acting performances, that distinguishes this
Merchant-Ivory film. Kaylie Jones's enduring, unbridled homage to the
memory of her father presents him as a tender, doting, understanding
paragon of loving, paternal qualities. James Jones becomes the father
every girl wishes she had. And cinematographer Jean-Marc Fabre
captures this wistful, nostalgic mood on film. The conclusion,
however, is enigmatic and problematic; given her = disturbed brother's
troubled background, it's just not credible that he would not read his
mother's diary which his sister holds for him. Nevertheless, on the
Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, "A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries" is
a subtle, delicately etched, poignant 7, a devoted "Daddy Dearest" for
the art house crowd.</P>
