<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is Sam Peckinpah's masterpiece. The ultimate in violent Westerns,
filled with clichés and violence drawn to extremes. In Peckinpah's
rugged masculine world, brutality and innocence (children) co-exist. The
opening scene highlights Peckinpah's theme of man's inherent violent
nature from childhood and points to the bloodshed that will come in the
film's payoff, as he shows a bunch of Mexican children poking a stick at
a writhing scorpion being devoured by killer ants and of them laughing
as they watch. This is witnessed by a gang of outlaws on their way to a
brutal robbery.</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoilers to follow.</PRE>
<P>A band of soldiers led by Pike Bishop (Holden) and his right-hand man
Dutch Engstrom (Ernest Borgnine) by his side, ride into town by horse in
a military manner. They are not really soldiers, but they are in this
dusty South Texas border town dressed that way to rob the railroad
office of its gold. The only problem is, that they are being set-up for
an ambush, arranged by a particularly despicable railroad magnate named
Harrigan (Dekker).</P>
<P>Things start to go wrong immediately for the ambushers awaiting on the
roof of the building across from the railroad office, who are led by
Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan). His low-life bounty hunters get on the
nerve of the professional gunman by pointing their rifles upward in
sight of the street, showing their ineptitude. Thornton once rode with
Pike's gang, but he felt that Pike betrayed him through his carelessness
which resulted in his arrest, and he now sees this assignment as both a
chance to get revenge and to be free from his prison term, as he now has
a deal with Harrigan that if he brings Pike and his gang in, he will be
released from prison. He has given his word that he will get Pike, and
his word is all that is needed as a bond that he will not run away.</P>
<P>Pike's men soon see the glint of the rifles on the roof and prepare for
a fast escape. To make matters worst, a Temperance Union meeting just
breaks up and they are marching in front of the robbery scene. The six
men trapped in the railroad office, besides Pike and Dutch -- are the
brothers Lyle Gorch (Warren Oates) and Tector Gorch (Ben Johnson), and a
Mexican just taken into the gang, Angel (Jaime Sánchez). The sixth
member is Crazy Lee (Bo Hopkins). He is asked to remain behind and guard
the hostages in the railroad office. The gang uses the marchers,
consisting largely of children and women, as shields for their escape,
and Thornton's men do not hesitate for a second, firing into the crowd
and killing some of the marchers and in the chaos 5 of the 6 bandits
escape with the bags of gold, only the one they left behind gets killed.</P>
<P>When the bandits go to their rendezvous point to get fresh horses and
split up the loot, the old geezer who is part of the gang, Sykes (Edmond
O'Brien), greets them with maddening cackles of jubilation. When they
open up their railroad bags, they are surprised to find them filled with
washers. Discouraged but still able to laugh at their misfortune, Pike's
gang goes to Mexico and passes through Angel's ravaged home village,
with the bounty hunters in hot pursuit.</P>
<P>The film is set in 1913 and Europe is nearing the outbreak of WW1, while
in Mexico there is a revolution taking place and a self-appointed
dictator with the help of Germany, is looting the country and arming
himself while trying to put down the revolution. Angel turns out to be
opposed to the local dictator, Mapache (Emilio Fernandez), who has
sacked his village and, on a personal basis, he is revolted to learn
that his girlfriend has voluntarily run off with the generalissimo.</P>
<P>Pike sees in this generalissimo an opportunity to get gold, as he is
told when he meets him of a U.S. Army shipment of weapons coming through
by rail, which he doesn't want to rob himself because he doesn't want to
alienate the U.S.. The gringos agree to do it for the money promised
them by the dictator, as they have nothing to lose because they are
wanted anyway back in the States, with a heavy price tag on their heads.
Only Angel is upset by this, saying he sides with the people in the
mountains fighting the dictator. So a deal is secretly worked out
whereas they will allow Angel to take one crate of rifles to the freedom
fighters and they will tell the dictator they lost one shipment of
rifles.</P>
<P>These outlaws are seen as the last of a dying breed. Their bonds are
formed through loyalty: by giving their word, whoring together, getting
boozed up together, and being bad desperadoes, willing to die for their
outlaw lifestyle, they have formed a comraderie that even humanizes
their violent ways to a certain extent. But there are changes in the air
and these are seen by them clearly while they are on the run--such as,
the generalissimo's automobile, the telegraph wires and the railroad now
linking the country, and the worn expressions they have when riding
their horses. They realize America and the West as they knew it -- is
history, and that there is no place for them in the new America.</P>
<P>They thusly side with the freedom fighters when they had a chance to
keep the money and escape the bounty hunters. They come to rescue Angel
who is being tortured in the generalissimo's headquarters by being
dragged on the ground while tied by rope to the dictator's automobile
going around in circles and the children in the village laughing and
lobbing firecrackers at him, as he is there because he was ratted out
for stealing the rifles by the mother of his girlfriend. Thereby the
memorable closing scene, which is a picture of pure violence as an
answer to everything, as the generalissimo's men and Pike's remaining
men shoot it out, leaving no survivors. It is only Thornton and Sykes
who live and find salvation by staying in Mexico and joining with the
freedom fighters. Sykes when wounded by the bounty hunters and left to
die, was rescued from certain death by the freedom fighters who
discovered him in the desert. Thornton's bounty hunters, including two
vicious vultures, Coffer (Strother Martin) and T.C. (L.Q. Jones), try to
go back home with their bounty of the deadmen: Pike and his gang, to
collect their reward, but are not successful. While Thornton makes it
clear that he has no respect for the law, for the capitalists, or for
the U.S. Army, but he respects Pike because he stood for something real
and he realizes that the two of them have this in common, and he has
been brooding about their troubled relationship ever since he took on
this assignment. His conscience is also clear about not returning,
because he only gave his word to get Pike and not to what he would do
afterwards. He can now only laugh at what he's been through, as he heads
to the hills to be a gunfighter for the cause he might or might not
understand, but he has given his word to the revolutionaries and his
word is his badge of honor.</P>
<P>They don't make violent Westerns like this one anymore, but they tried
to imitate it many times, but they could never quite capture the spirit
that this classic Western had.</P>
