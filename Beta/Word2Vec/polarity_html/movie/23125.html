<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Joel Schumacher's "8 MM" jumps into the underworld of pornography,
focusing on the makers of "snuff" films, those who are so vile that they
make the ones in the regular porno business seem like angels in
comparison. Nicolas Cage as Tom Welles, an ambitious career, family man
from Harrisburg, Pa., whose father was a coal miner but he went to
college on an academic scholarship, choosing to do surveillance work
because that's where the big money is at. Slowly building up a
repetition in the field because of his discretion, he gets his break
when a coal factory tycoon dies and his widow, Mrs. Christian (Myra), on
her lawyer's (Heald) recommendation chooses him to find out if the
"snuff film" she found in her husband's safe, actually happened. She
wants to know if the girl is alive or dead.</P>
<P>Tom kisses his loving wife Amy (Keener) and his baby daughter goodbye,
and tells them don't ask questions, I'm doing this so we can all live
better. Catherine Keener, a normally interesting actress, has nothing to
do in this role but whine and act drab. All the Charles Bronson-like
heroics are reserved for Cage, in a role that is more incredulous than
believable, and less introspective than ridiculous, as he heads for
Cleveland after tracking down who the missing girl is through the
computer files of the missing persons records and identifies the girl as
Mary Anne Matthews. In Cleveland he talks with her mother (Morton) and
is able to track the white-thrash 16-year-old girl's next destination as
Hollywood. Cage, at all times seems wooden, never relaxed in the role.
It makes one nervous just watching him trying to act a role he can't
seem to get the handle on.</P>
<P>All his reactions against the evil people he is up against, are
knee-jerk reactions, whereas nothing feels hearfelt. It seems as if it
is a set-up for the middle-class audience, the one the film hopes to
attract, so they will get some vicarious feelings of revenge as Tom acts
as a surrogate for them, who will enforce the law vigilante-style from
his nebulous position of highly paid private investigator. What the
director thought he was getting, was Tom searching for the evil in
himself, where this straight-arrow becomes capable of taking the law
into his own hands by dancing with the devil and becoming like the
devil. It just never came off that way, and for a number of reasons, not
the least of them being, was that Cage wasn't right for the part and
that he was never seen in a reflective moment undergoing a life change.
The dramatics here seemed misplaced, as if they were intended more for
one of the director's Batman flicks, something the director brought more
life to than he did with this film.</P>
<P>The writer is Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote ''Seven,''as he toiled at
his day job as a clerk in a New York City Tower Records store. He again
has a protagonist who looks at evil and is amazed by it. But this time
the look seems artificial and not well-placed, as Cage is not really an
introspective person, he is just someone trying to make a better life
for himself at a job he is good at. And that is the main problem with
the film, it has a false gritty noir look to it. This film is not the
real deal, it's ersatz. Therefore it never works on the intellect,
instead it attacks the emotions and cheapens its efforts by pretending
to delve into Cage's angst. Even the credible camera work, which seems
too sharp-edged for the film, works against it, because it is so much
better than the story and the weak acting, that it highlights even more,
how artificial the film seems.</P>
<P>The film seems most comfortable when it is in the middle of its soft
porn scenes, as Tom reaches the sleazy streets of Hollywood and watches
some porno films in his motel room. He finds an adult book store and
befriends the clerk, Max California (Phoenix), into helping him get
around in the porn world, a world Tom makes faces at, showing us how
nice a guy he is by not liking this sleazy form of sex.</P>
<P>We know Max is a good-guy because he is reading Truman Capote, not some
porn novel, while working behind the cash register. Tom is so impressed
with Max, that he hires him to locate the maker of the snuff film he is
looking for, and the two become soul mates, sort of telling us they both
do what they do because they have to make a living and are blind to the
consequences of their work. Max once had ambitions to be a musician, but
in Los Angeles, the sex trade is such an easy lure, that it takes many
an aspiring artist down its sleazy path, as they think there is no other
way for them to make a living.</P>
<P>The heavies of the film are all personifications of pure evil. There is
nothing good about them. They belong to the underworld of porn. Machine
(Bauer), Eddie Poole (Gandolfini), and Dino Velvet (Stormare), are the
ones Tom must come up against to find his answer if the girl is still
alive. There is one other mystery evil man, the producer of the film,
the one who pocketed most of the money for the film, cheating his trio
of partners. Machine is the masked one in the films, the one who knifes
the girl to death. Poole is the contact and distributor of the film.
Velvet is the tacky artist; he makes the films. Velvet is considered to
be the Jim Jarmusch of S&M films. His creepy studio of torture devices
and knives and whips, will be the place where Tom takes these perverts
on and seeks revenge for the girl he completely identifies with.</P>
<P>The results are as gratituous as any found in a myriad of cheap
adventure films that appeal to a ready made audience, not looking for a
thinking picture. The box office mistake of this film, is that it took
itself seriously, somehow believing itself a thinking picture, and
thereby lost both types of audiences. Because those who enjoy the
exploitive gore films, must have found something lacking here also, like
just enough thinking to turn them off from the film.</P>
<P>The film had perhaps one line in it that didn't seem phony, when the
masked killer is unmasked and says, " The things I do--I do them because
I like them. Because I want to. I wasn't abused as a child. I don't hate
my parents.'' At last, the writer and director have located where the
evil comes from that they are looking for. It is everywhere. The film's
saving grace is that it had a morality to it, one that the viewer might
have trouble reconciling in his mind, as the handcuffed to the bed
private investigator fights his way out of the porno studio and has to
call the victim's mother to see if she loved her daughter and thinks her
killers should die, before he can take his revenge on them. That dilemma
might have worked as a morality play, if the acting and the story didn't
seem so wooden and phony.</P>
