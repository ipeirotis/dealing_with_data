REVIEWED BY: Alex Ioshpe (C) 1998<HR></P>
<PRE>RATING: 3/10 </PRE>
<P>I have never been so confused after watching a movie. "Meet Joe Black"
is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year,
with a cinematography, music and cast that will dazzle most of us. At
the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience
hat you will have this season.</P>
<P>At first you marvel at the elegant direction, graceful cinematography
and sensual musical score. Then you'll wait for something to happen
for half an hour, but when you finally understand what's going on,
you'll wonder what are actors such as Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and
Claire Forlani are doing in a film like this? The script is simply a
silly and unresolved story, which is artificially stretched into a
three hour long motion picture. It feels like an eternity. Most of the
time it is a pompous soap opera, filled with empty dialogue that the
actors deliver in a high pitched voice and " meaningful" winks.</P>
<P>The film is based on Alberto Caesella's play "Death Takes A
Holiday". The story concentrates around Bill (Anthony Hopkins) who
lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man, but sometimes he
wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying
"yes". Soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen (Brad Pitt) who
introduces himself as "Death". It is Bill's time. But Death has other
plans. It has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means
to be alive. Our Bill is chosen to be Death's guide and in exchange he
gets time. Bill introduces Death as Joe Black, who immediately becomes
the center of everyone's attention. Bill's business partners speculate
about why Joe is constantly at Bill's side, lives in his house and
resides at his office. That is not all, however. Bill's youngest
daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) falls in love with the mysterious
stranger and Joe falls in love with her. This relationship is bound to
have some serious consequences.</P>
<P>It wouldn't be fair to say that this film didn't have some interesting
moments, such as the scene where Joe is invited to join Bill's family
for dinner. When Joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in
love, the experience is somewhat different. It is obvious that a story
like this story is very difficult to structure. It's one thing to say:
"Wouldn't it be fun to have Death take human form and come down to
earth.." To create a motion picture out of this is another. Four
screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic. It
is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film. On the other
hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent
direction by Martin Brest ("Scent of a Woman"). Hopkins looks great in
any role, and no matter how shallow or hollow it is, he will complete
it. His talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else,
since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment. But
Pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent
time. How can you play Death in human form? To me it seems that death
and life are not something that can be associated with earthly
matters. They are not creatures, but phenomenas. Saying that death
takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would
take human form. Handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly
difficult and Pitt deserves some credit for his work. Speaking in a
calm, soft voice, portraying Death as a lonely, distant and powerful
guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters. He looks and
acts more like an Angel of Death, rather than a demon or a red-eyed
executioner. Claire Forlani and others are also fine, stretching their
stereotypical characters to their limits. Unfortunately their
performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self
inflicted misery.</P>
<P>In other words this is not what I expected from the director of "Scent
of a Woman". It could (and should) be better with such cast and
crew. In the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working
on a ravishingly looking soap opera.</P>
