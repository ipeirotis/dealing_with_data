MEDEA (TV) (director: Lars von Trier; cast: Vera Gebuhr, Ludmilla
Glinska (Glauce), Solbjørg Højfeldt, Henning Jensen (Creon), Udo Kier
(Jason), Kirsten Olesen (Medea), Baard Owe (Aiceus), 1987-Denmark)</P>
<P>So what if the great Danish director, Carl Theodor Dreyer's screenplay,
written with Preben Thomsen in the mid-60s, is not adhered to, so be it!
Dreyer died in 1968, unable to get funding for the film.What counts is
what von Trier has done with the film he has inherited from Dreyer.
Right ! So who cares about his self-promotional schemes that have turned
many people off him. I'm talking about him saying that he communed with
the spirits of Dreyer and those spirits approved of what he is doing to
change the film. I just can't get caught up in that nonsense, for me,
it's what I see on screen that counts. It does not matter how others
filmed it or would have filmed it, whether it is Pasolini's most
interesting 1969 version of it, starring Maria Callas or von Trier's
take on it, that is the better one. And even though both Pasolini and
von Trier are gifted filmmakers, with Pasolini, in my opinion, being the
more poetical and imaginative of the two, nevertheless, Dreyer is still
the master, and I would have expected more from him than I do from the
others, though I am pleased to say, I am sated by both these differing
versions of Medea, but in differing ways.</P>
<P>Vision and intensity are certainly important elements in a film, and
that is what is the driving force behind this film, based on Euripides'
tragedy, that was made for Danish TV. And that is what made me become
taken aback by the power of von Trier's camera, the majesty of his amber
and golden and brownish shadings, that is what made the tragedy even
more moving, as he took me into the hearts of the innocent kids this
woman hung from a small tree in order to satisfy her vanity. It was as
mythic as the crucification of Jesus or the sacrifice Abraham would have
done if God asked him to do it. This tale of Medea is still a living
myth, one that every generation should come to its own terms with, and
that is precisely what Trier has attempted to do.</P>
<P>Knowing the story doesn't necessarily preclude that we can feel the
story. Whatever opinion you might have about von Trier's telling of the
myth, you can agree that his version of it, is definetly a deeply felt
emotional experience, one that went to the heart of the matter in terms
of feeling the agony of what a woman who has lost touch with herself
because of her pride, is going through. By emphasizing her feelings as
being only for herself, her irrationality is made rational, even if it
isn't rational. Through her fall from grace, we see the tragedy unfold,
and the deadly consequences of her jealousy and sense of being wronged
come around to its bitter fruition.</P>
<P>Medea (Kirsten) has been dumped by her husband, Jason (Udo), for a
younger and more attractive woman, Glauce (Ludmilla), whose father is
King Creon (Henning). Jason comes across as a modern male chauvinist
pig, someone with cold feelings, whose ambitious nature rules his life.
Medea is the scorned woman, the intuitive one, the one capable of
performing black magic. When told by King Creon that she must leave the
country with her two sons or else, she plots her revenge. And she gets
her wish for revenge, by sweet talking Jason into accepting her wedding
gift for his bride, a queen's crown that she has dabbed with poison,
hoping that the bride will prick herself on it. Playing on Jason's
paternal instincts, she gets him to believe that she wants him to keep
the kids because she was wrong and he was right in what he did, now that
she has had time to think it over. Thusly, she talks him into softening
up his bride with the gift, and then, he will be able to get her to ask
her father to give permission for the kids to remain with him and his
new bride, and she would be content to leave the country knowing that
her children will be properly cared for.</P>
<P>The dialogue is sparse. The open air scenery is intense, it appeared to
me as if I was looking at Van Gogh's wheatfields, with the wind swirling
forcefully in and out of the fields. There was a mystical feel to his
mise- en- scene, tragedy was inevitably in the air, whether in the
distant sea or on the faces of the children running through the fields,
playing like children do but stopping at times to look into the camera
with perplexed expressions on their faces, as the wind runs across their
blond hair.</P>
<P>And this tale is all the more a tragedy... because Medea takes the
children to the tree to hang them even though she loves them both. And
when the younger one runs away, the older one brings him back to her,
and her deed is done, her mold is cast in stone, as she then proceeds to
carry out the death of the older, the more obedient son, the one she
dearly loves as much as she loves anything else in this world.</P>
<P>All that is left for us to see, is the final fade-out shot, with the
disbelieving and enfeebled Jason, who is left with a poisoned
father-in-law and bride, and the dead children he would have abandoned
or kept with him, whatever the circumstances dictated. As a result, he
has lost his will to live, and we see him moaning in pain as he takes
his life in the amber fields.</P>
<P>Kristen is an accomplished and noted actress, her performance was as
emotionally and intellectually satisfying as the one Dreyer got from his
young unknown actress (Renée Falconetti) in his THE PASSION OF JOAN OF
ARC (1928). The only difference is that from Dreyer's style of
simplicity in filmmaking, we can feel the pains ourself, we didn't need
it enlarged and magnified by wasted and unnecessary movements. For von
Trier, he must get himself catapulted into the story, simplicity and
spareness is not enough for him, he doesn't trust it, everyone must know
that this is his stylized version of the myth.</P>
<P>That he succeeds in this film, is certainly evident. He succeeds because
he has found the right Medea for the part, and has caught enough of the
mood without ruining it as he almost does, by going overboard with his
excesses. I am mainly referring to the hanging scenes of the children.
He came very close to turning me off, as I was beginning to suspect that
these scenes didn't have to be that explicit in all its morbid details,
the idea of having the older child go back for the younger one, seemed
to me, to be exploitive and incredulous, as well as unnecessary. All we
had to see was the pained expression on Medea and the children and we
could have drawn our own visions, even more powerful ones than the ones
we materially witnessed.</P>
<P>The reason Dreyer is a master and one of the greatest directors ever, is
because he did not compromise his integrity or the film's integrity
going after anything that was superfluous to the telling of the story. I
always get the feeling when I am seeing a Dreyer film, I am seeing
something that is truly visionary. Yet when I see a von Trier film, I
can't say the same, even though he is a very talented director, I just
can't trust his judgment when it comes to telling the story without it
seeming to be pretentious. I am never sure if he really got it or if he
is putting me on.</P>
