<PRE>Mission: Impossible 2 </PRE>
<P>Tom Cruise is back as super secret agent Ethan Hunt who must save the world - 
not from nuclear war or
terrorists - but from a lethal man-made virus. An original idea to be sure, 
but the execution of the story is
not. Instead of being too confusing like the last time, this time it's almost 
too simple and certain key plot
points and sequences are waaaaaay over the top and unbelievable. Action 
filmmaker John Woo certainly
puts a lot more energy into this film than Brian De Palma did in 1996. We can 
really buy Cruise as a genuine
action performer (the long, drawn-out fight scene at the end is proof of 
this). </P>
<P>Whatever you're expecting this film to be will, it WILL be, so enjoy the 
ride. </P>
