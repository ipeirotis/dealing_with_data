<PRE>                               CEMETERY MAN
                           (DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<P>     CEMETERY MAN is an English language horror story by Italian 
director Michele Soavi.  It tries to be erotic, funny, supernatural, and 
shocking.  It succeeds with the later.  This is a gross picture with few 
redeeming features.  I can not think of them now, but I am sure there 
must have been some.</P>
<P>     CEMETERY MAN tells the story of Francesco Dellamorte (Rupert 
Everett from DUNSTON CHECKS IN) who is the watchman at the Buffalora 
Cemetery.  He is assisted by an enormous and gross half-wit known as 
Gnaghi (Francois Hadji Lazaro).  I hope never to see this terrible actor 
again.  Watching him is painful.</P>
<P>     Dellamorte has a problem.  As soon as his guests arrive, they do 
not politely stay buried.  Instead they rise from their coffins, and he 
must split their heads open to make them stay dead.  The is done with 
brains exposed.  Best to eat before you see the show.</P>
<P>     Dellamorte is a philosopher and a playboy.  He muses that, "at a 
certain point in your life you realize you know more dead people than 
living."  An intellectual he is not although he is a college graduate.  
He says that, "I haven't read more than two books in my whole life.  One 
I never finished, and the other is the phone book."  This is one of the 
few lines in the script by Giovanni Romoli, and based on the book by 
Tiziano Sclavi, that is actually funny.  </P>
<P>     Most of the humor is macabre sight gags.  If you find extreme 
grossness humorous, you may like it.  To me when Gnaghi eats with food 
pouring out of his mouth onto his chin and clothes, I was not impressed.  
When he constantly drools, I do not find it cute.  The low point of the 
humor is that when Gnaghi meets girls that turn him on, he throws up on 
them, literally.</P>
<P>     Let me describe a typical scene so you get an idea as to what this 
uniquely bad film is like.  One of three women known only as "she" and 
all played by Anna Falchi takes Dellamorte into an ossuary.  There she 
kisses him but insists they kiss each other only through thick flowing 
veils.  A skeleton pulls her blouse partially off, and then she takes 
Dellamorte to make love on top of her recently buried husband's grave.  
Supernatural small torches like large insects keep interrupting them.  </P>
<P>     The scene switches to a view from inside the husband's coffin.  He 
pushes the top open and steps out of his grave to attack them.  He has 
large vines growing through his body.  He starts realistically chewing 
off large sections of skin from his wife's body.  Dellamorte stops this 
by grabbing a cross and splitting the husband's head open with brains 
and blood flying.  Sickening enough for you?</P>
<P>     As Dellamorte puts it to Gnaghi toward the end, "pass this town is 
the rest of the world.  What do you think the rest of the world looks 
like?"  I take just the opposite view and wonder why the rest of the 
world had to look at this town through this movie.  There are people who 
love these Italian blends of horror and comedy, but I now know that I am 
not one of them if this monstrosity is representative.</P>
<P>     CEMETERY MAN runs 1:40.  It is rated R for sex, nudity, some bad 
language, and lots of gore and violence.  I would not want my teenager 
to see it.  I suggest everyone avoid this show like the plague.  I give 
it 1/2 of a * only because did not quite reach the threshold of pain I 
reserve for zero star films, but it did come close.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
