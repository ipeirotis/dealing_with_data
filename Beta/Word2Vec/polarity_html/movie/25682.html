<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"Space Cowboys" opens in 1958 at Edwards Air Force Base in the
California desert. The black-and-white photography starkly highlights
the empty sky and the frolicking nature of four test pilots who are
breaking the sound barrier in the experimental X-2 rocket plane. But, in
the process of their daredevil tactics, the pilot and co-pilot have to
bail out and crash the expensive plane. As a result, the snaky officer
in charge of them, James Cromwell, grounds them from further space
missions, and to add insult to injury, announces that a monkey will be
the first to orbit space. He also announces that a new organization
called NASA will use astronauts for further space exploration, no longer
will the Air Force be in charge of the program.</P>
<P>Cromwell is faced with a crisis 42 years later, as a joint program
between the U.S. and Russia, has run into a problem-- the Russian
satellite communication ship Ikon has developed a failure in the system
and is about to crash. As a gesture of good will and political
diplomacy, Cromwell offers to send his team of astronauts to repair the
problem. But, it's not so easy, the system is an antiquated one and was
built by Clint Eastwood when he was the engineer designer for Skylab,
and it turns out that Clint is the only one who knows how to locate and
fix the problem in that obsolete system. These new engineers and punky
young astronauts have all been raised on computer technology and have no
idea about the old language used in space technology, to the chagrin of
Clint.</P>
<P>Cromwell, on the urgings of a space agency head, whose expertise is in
engineering, Marcia Gay Harden, decides to contact his old rival Clint
for help. When told about it in his suburban California home, Clint, who
is living in retirement, tinkering around in his garage and seemingly
happily married, tells Marcia he doesn't trust Cromwell. When he meets
with Cromwell, he tells him that he will not train the astronauts
because there is not enough time to do so, and refuses to budge from his
position, even when ridiculed for not being a team player. He says, I
will only fix the problem if my old Daedalus Team goes on the mission,
which is met by jeers from Cromwell. But they work out a deal whereby
the geriatric crew can go, with the provision being that they must pass
the physical and endurance tests. The crusty flight director of the
program, William Devane, also insists that two of his hotshot
astronauts, Loren Dean and Courtney B. Vance, also go along, especially
since the old codgers are not familiar with the new computer systems
that run the space vehicles nowadays.</P>
<P>To add some cold war paranoia to the story, Clint wonders how the
Russians got his equipment since it was classified information, only
available to the Americans.</P>
<P>When Clint's blackmail strategy works, he goes to gather the other
senior citizens to join the mission. He finds James Garner in Oklahoma
City, where he is a second-rate Baptist preacher; Donald Sutherland is
designing roller coasters, and though sporting a gray pony tail, wearing
glasses and having false teeth, and being pictured as a friendly wolf
around the younger ladies--he will be the flight engineer; Tommy Lee
Jones is at least twenty years younger than those other three seventy
plus seniors. He is not on good terms with Clint ever since they were
grounded from any further space missions as pilots in 1958 and Clint
blamed him for that, accusing him of being a reckless pilot, someone who
took too many risks. Tommy is now working as a stunt pilot on a
crop-duster, giving harrowing rides to those who request them. After
thinking about the chance to go into space, a dream all the men had,
Tommy decides to go along and make history with the other men. This
premise would seem improbable, but in the recent news of the geriatric
John Glenn going on a space mission for experimental purposes, it shows
that their mission is possible, though not in the manner as depicted in
this fantasy film.</P>
<P>The story takes the men through their training sessions, and each of
them, giving understated performances, tries to outdo the other. Tommy,
who is a widower, has a romantic spin with Marcia, who looks attractive
despite her official looking NASA hairstyle. Donald is prone to act like
the improvident reader of 1958 Playboy magazines he was back then,
showing that his lifestyle hasn't changed even with his advancing years.
While Garner has faith in God and his lucky dancing doll, but is given
the short-end of the script and therefore has only a few lines to chew
on in his competition with the others. There are a lot of good natured
jokes about aging and some friendly ribbing between the young astronauts
and the veterans, and it all seems pleasantly entertaining, though
somewhat staged. Clint even makes fun of some of his older pictures,
which I presume is why he has so much fun with the monkey in the opening
scene. Everything seemed smooth and compliable with a formula movie, and
it seemed as if the actors were having a good time acting together.</P>
<P>The heaviness in the story came about when America's old cold war
paranoia was introduced into the mission. The paranoia is a reminder
from those cold war days, when many Americans thought that the Russians
were looking for a chance to nuke America. The mission turns out to be
more dangerous than first perceived, as betrayal and nukes surface.</P>
<P>But through the wonderful special effects and the full cooperation of
NASA as consultants, there was a sense of awe in seeing the sights of
space travel. And, when Clint is able to make an impossible landing,
something Hollywood films are good at doing, there is a sense of relief
that the old timer, who now has a lined and craggy face and looks like
an American icon, is safe and sound. Since the film didn't take itself
so seriously, there was no undue tension and everything was fun, even
all the contrivances the film allowed for.</P>
<P>This is not one of Clint's top films, but if it is his swan song, as
rumored, there are a lot of reasons why this is not a bad film to end
one's career on. The love and affection from his fellow actors comes
through loud and clear, in this well-crafted production, which shows
Clint could direct with the skills that only the most competent
Hollywood directors possessed, even if Clint never reached greatness
himself, as he was unable to overcome his artistic limitations. What he
couldn't do in this film, was move beyond the easy humor and special
effects, and make a film that had something involving to say about old
age and those facing death.</P>
