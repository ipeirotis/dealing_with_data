<P>     Sometimes, it's impossible not to contemplate what a motion
picture could have been, had a few things about it been different.
Often, especially for very good or very bad movies, the changes will
make little difference.  However, in the case of THE HOUSE OF THE
SPIRITS, which is a worthy effort as it stands, certain alterations
(not all of which would have been simple to execute) might have
transformed this into a devastating film.  Alas, deficiencies rob the
picture of a share of its impact, limiting the ultimate emotional
appeal and power of Bille August's adaptation of Isabel Allende's
novel.</P>
<P>     THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS is a story that spans six decades,
beginning in South America in 1926 and ending in the same country in
the early 1970s.  The primary focus is on Esteban Trueba (Jeremy Irons)
who, as a young man, comes courting the beautiful and gentle Rosa Del
Valle (Teri Polo).  The two are set to be married when Rosa
accidentally drinks from a poisoned glass of wine meant for her father
Severo (Armin Mueller-Stahl).  Following the death of his fiancee,
Esteban travels to the countryside to claim the plantation of Tres
Marias, which he moulds into a thriving estate using the labor of those
living on the land.  In 1944, he returns to the village of his birth to
ask the other Del Valle daughter, the clairvoyant Clara (Meryl Streep),
to be his wife.  The pair marry and, along with Esteban's sister Ferula
(Glenn Close), move to Tres Marias where a stormy life, filled with
deceptions and brutality, unfolds in the shadow of revolution.</P>
<P>     THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS is driven by its complex and many-faceted
plot, not by the characters that populate the film.  The story moves
along at a rapid pace, sometimes glossing over the more trivial events
that might have bolstered the substance of the protagonists.  Events
fly by as fast as the decades, with political activities gaining
importance as the movie races towards its conclusion.  What starts out
as a relatively simple love story ends as a clash between cultures and
classes, between the old ways and the new ones.</P>
<P>     Many of the characters, both major and minor, are little more than
ciphers for a certain point-of-view or belief.  This includes Pedro
(Antonio Banderas), the lower-class revolutionary; Esteban Garcia
(Vincent Gallo), the unprincipled army officer; and even Ferula, the
maligned and misunderstood sister who wants only to be shown love and
affection.</P>
<P>     Even Jeremy Irons' Esteban remains relatively undeveloped until
well into the second half, when events conspire to re-mould his
previously intransigent personality, lending it depth and dimension.
Meryl Streep's Clara is one of the few characters to be well-rounded
from the start, although even in her case, there is unplumbed
territory--her odd psychic powers are only occasionally brought into
use, and then as minor plot devices, when so much more could have been
formed from that raw material.</P>
<P>     Winona Ryder is given perhaps her most difficult role to date, and
carries it off with aplomb.  As Blanca, the daughter of Esteban and
Clara, she plays an integral part in all the develops during the second
half of the motion picture, including the events that finally open her
father's eyes to those basic truths which he had been hiding from.</P>
<P>     In addition to that of Ms. Ryder, the best performances are given
by Ms. Close, Ms. Streep, and Mr. Irons (although it becomes something
of an annoyance trying to pin down what Esteban's accent is supposed to
be).  Each member of this well-respected trio does the kind of job
expected of them.  It's surely a bit of a stretch for Ms. Streep to
appear as a young woman in her early twenties, but with the help of the
makeup artist, she succeeds in suspending our disbelief.</P>
<P>     Perhaps director August was constrained by running time, but his
latest project shows little of the careful examination of character
that his two most celebrated films--PELLE THE CONQUEROR and THE BEST
INTENTIONS--exhibit.  In fact, THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS is in many
ways the antithesis of THE BEST INTENTIONS.  While the latter was a
slow-moving piece that allowed its participants time to grow and
breathe, this new film seems at times constrained and cramped.</P>
<P>     Regardless of its flaws, however, THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS is an
engrossing motion picture.  It doesn't capitulate with the "Hollywood
mentality" that demands a complete ending, willing instead to risk
something open-ended.  The story attains a momentum of its own that
sweeps the viewer along until the end.  This movie is one-hundred
forty- two minutes long, but could easily have been double that, had
the screenplay demanded it.</P>
<P>     At its best, THE HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS interweaves the very
personal story of its main characters with the turbulent political
backdrop which frames their actions.  Bille August has done a fine job
with Isabel Allende's tale, crafting a captivating motion picture, but
it's hard not to recognize the flaws, and wonder about the lost
potential.</P>
