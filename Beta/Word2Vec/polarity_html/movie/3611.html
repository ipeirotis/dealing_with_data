<P>     This is the second film from director He Jianjun, who has worked on 
pictures with Fifth Generation film makers Chen Kaige (FAREWELL MY 
CONCUBINE), Zhang Yimou (RAISE THE RED LANTERN), and Tian Zhuangzhuang 
(THE BLUE KITE).  His first effort, 1993's RED BEADS, won the Fipresci 
Award during that year's Rotterdam International Film Festival.  POSTMAN 
captured the Tiger Award at the same venue earlier this year, although 
there was some initial uncertainty about whether director He would be 
able to show this film after the Chinese government tried to stop its 
completion.  The movie had to be smuggled to Europe where a grant 
allowed it to be finished. </P>
<P>     After viewing POSTMAN, I'll probably never be certain of the 
privacy of any correspondence sent through the mail.  Although this film 
takes place in China, the nature of human curiosity allows for similar 
events to occur any place in the world.  After all, who can say that the 
secrets of a letter have not been perused by one or more mail handlers?  
However, POSTMAN is not designed to foster paranoia.  Instead, it deals 
with at least two compelling subjects:  voyeurism and the inability of 
one man to take responsibility for the consequences of his actions.   </P>
<P>     The voyeurism of Xiadou (Fang Yuanzheng) is not the "typical" sort.  
Quiet and  introverted, the young postal worker spends much of his time 
alone in his room.  When an older man loses his route after admitting to 
reading letters he was entrusted to deliver, Xiadou is offered the job.  
He accepts, but soon the same fascination grips him.  Cautious and 
tentative at first, he purloins a few letters, takes them home, and 
opens them.  Once Pandora's Box is unlidded, however, Xiadou is 
hopelessly enthralled, and he becomes obsessed by the lives of those in 
his district.  His actions go beyond merely reading; he rewrites 
letters, meets people face-to-face, and visits abandoned flats.  Along 
the way, Xiadou's sexuality is awakened as a result of contact with a 
young prostitute.  This leads to an incestuous tryst with his sister--a
relationship which devastates her but leaves him unaffected.  In fact, 
guilt is something Xiadou never feels, even though his meddling causes 
confusion and heartbreak, and perhaps even contributes to a death. </P>
<P>     With POSTMAN, director He Jianjun explores the connection between 
voyeurism, sexuality, and a failure of conscience.  The movie is also a 
compelling character study.  Xiadou starts out as a normal, shy young 
man.  By the final scene, he is a living example of amorality, seeing 
all life as a game for him to indulge in.  He denies culpability, even 
when it's his own sister who is traumatized.   </P>
<P>     Certainly, POSTMAN traces an extreme instance--a pastime that has 
evolved into an obsession.  This is not some harmless case of glancing 
through an open window.  In Xiadou's view, his own life has meaning only 
through whatever vicarious pleasure he can derive by reading the mail of 
others.  Given an opportunity to go out with an attractive co-worker, he 
would rather stay home to read his day's "stash."  The script 
illustrates the dangers of such behavior, both to the innocents who 
become unwitting victims, and to Xiadou's own personality. </P>
<P>     The difficulty with this film is that it's often confusing and 
difficult to follow.  The editing is choppy and there are scenes where 
it's hard to determine what's going on.  This abstruseness is not 
merely an artistic conceit--it's a legitimate impediment to the full 
appreciation of the director's message.  There is a great deal of value 
in what this movie has to say, but there are times when the difficulty 
of extracting the themes becomes nearly counterproductive.  
Nevertheless, despite this imperfect, disconcerting style, the material 
is still provacative enough to make POSTMAN of more than passing 
interest. </P>
