<P>     HOUSEHOLD SAINTS, based on the complex novel by Francine Prose, is
really two distinct, albeit interrelated, stories.  While the first
claims an easygoing, amiable tone and a few interesting characters, the
second, although imaginatively-realized, is poorly-paced and saddled
with a bland protagonist.</P>
<P>     Set just after World War II in New York's Little Italy, HOUSEHOLD
SAINTS opens in the midst of a brutal heat wave.  A group of local men
are gathered for their regular game of pinochle in the back room of the
butcher's shop.  When Lino Falconetti (Victor Argo) runs out of money,
he agrees to wager the hand of his daughter Catherine (Tracey Ullman)
against unlimited blasts of chilly air from the freezer of his host,
Joseph Santangelo (Vincent D'Onofrio).  Joseph wins, and sets about
smoothing over the differences between himself and Catherine so that he
can claim his prize.</P>
<P>     Years later, Catherine and Joseph's daughter Teresa (Lili Taylor)
is growing into maturity, and has decided to follow the calling of God
and join the Carmelite order.  Her father, of the opinion that nuns are
sick in the head, forbids this.  Although bitter and hurt at first,
Teresa eventually decides to follow her mother's advice and be useful
as the Lord's servant in everyday matters.  So it happens that, one day
while ironing her boyfriend's shirt, Teresa has a vision of Jesus.</P>
<P>     HOUSEHOLD SAINTS begins with a promising sequence featuring the
fateful pinochle game in which Joseph wins the right to marry
Catherine.  Unfortunately, with the except of a few notable scenes
during the courtship of the pair, nothing else in the movie comes close
to matching the simple magic of the opening.  While most of the
Catherine/Joseph story is passably entertaining--if somewhat
unoriginal--the film strikes a dissonant chord when shifting its focus
to Teresa.</P>
<P>     In addition to dragging on for too long, Teresa's spiritual
struggles are uninteresting, as director Nancy Savoca proves unable to
create a compelling drama out of Teresa's relationship with God.
Expressions of Catholic mysticism comes across as hokey, and the
character as pathetic rather than sympathetic.  By the end of the
movie, it's difficult to care what happens to this confused girl.</P>
<P>     One of the faults of HOUSEHOLD SAINTS lies in the casting of
Tracey Ullman.  Lifeless and flat in her performance, Ullman fails to
imbue Catherine with more than the occasional, fleeting emotion.
>From her first appearance, trying to look much younger than she
actually is, it's apparent that the actress is wrong for the part.</P>
<P>     Vincent D'Onofrio, however, does an excellent job in his
three-phase role as randy bachelor, loving husband, and concerned
father.  His strengths help offset Ullman's weaknesses.  The supporting
cast is also solid, especially Judith Malina as the superstitious
mother who hates her son's choice for a bride.</P>
<P>     HOUSEHOLD SAINTS' decision to change viewpoint around the midway
point proves to be an unfortunate choice.  After laying the groundwork
for a story whose potential is never fully explored, the film
inexplicably metamorphoses from a simple drama about an Italian family
to an exploration of religious fanaticism.  The result is that
something which starts as an enjoyable narrative becomes disjointed and
uncomfortable, with a lighthearted tone at odds with its serious
theme.  HOUSEHOLD SAINTS is an admittedly ambitious project for Nancy
Savoca and her cast, but sometimes ambition isn't quite enough.</P>
