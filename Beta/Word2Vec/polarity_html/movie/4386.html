<PRE>                                  CASINO
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     CASINO is a disturbing show by the great director Martin Scorsese
(MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, THE KING OF COMEDY,
GOODFELLAS, CAPE FEAR, and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE).  Scorsese is obsessed
with evil and violence.  Think of him as the Darth Vader of directors,
and yet, his work is frequently brilliant.  His THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
was my second favorite movie of 1993.  (To answer your question,
GETTYSBURG was number one for me that year).  Scorsese has a talent of
which most directors can only dream.</P>
<P>     Like the FBI warnings on the front of video tapes, let me warn all
viewers who are incapable or unwilling to see movies with extremely
graphic and arguably gratuitously violent scenes, you should pass on
this movie.  Feel free to read the review of course.  I will cover the
gory aspects at the end when I discuss its ridiculous mere R rating.</P>
<P>     We are told that CASINO is a fictional show with fictional
characters that was adapted from a true story.  This means the audience
hasn't a clue as to how true or realistic any of this is.  I bought
some parts, but doubted others.  The degree of reality was not a big
issue for me in this picture.</P>
<P>     CASINO starts in the year 1983 with Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Robert
DeNiro) being blown to bits in a mob hit in Las Vegas.  It then
flashbacks back to ten years earlier and spends the rest of the movie
slowly working back to 1983.  It seems that Ace is one of the world's
best gamblers since he does the research to make sure his bets are all
sure things.  He makes so much money for the mob that they make him
manager of their Tangiers casino in Las Vegas.  He is a consummate
businessman and turns the Tangiers into a highly efficient operation
that is a money pump for the mob.</P>
<P>     The mob bosses stay safely in Kansas City, and they send a runner
once a week to skim money off of the top of the casino's take.  When
the runner comes, Ace and everyone else turn their heads.  Ace has a
series of titles at the casino to keep one step ahead of the gaming
commission, but the casino is nominally run by a puppet director of the
Teamster's Union pension fund, Phillip Greene (Kevin Pollak).  It turns
out all you had to do then to work in a casino was apply for a license,
actually getting one was unnecessary.  It took ten years to process the
application, and so long as you change titles every few years, your
application would go to the back to the bottom of the stack thus
ensuring that any unsavory past and any mob connections are never
discovered.  This and the details of operating a casino is the best
part of the show.  I collected tons of fun trivia about how pit bosses
work, how card cheating schemes are detected, etc.</P>
<P>     Eventually Ace, the Albert Speer of the casino business, has his
world complicated by the arrival of his old mob friend Nicky Santoro
(Joe Pesci).  Ace just wants to run a "clean" casino and spend his time
figuring out more innovative marketing techniques.  Nicky, on the other
hand, wants to use mayhem and murder to arrange payoffs from everyone
in all of the casinos, but especially in the Tangiers.  Since Nicky is
a made man, and Ace is Jewish, Nicky holds the upper hand with the mob.</P>
<P>     To further complicate this picture, we have Sharon Stone as Ginger
McKenna.  Ginger is a hooker, an alcoholic, and a heavy cocaine user
whom Ace falls in love with and marries much to the chagrin of her
sleazy pimp, Lester Diamond (James Woods).</P>
<P>     CASINO is told in a long series of narratives with all of the
leads and feature actors getting their chance to tell their version of
the story.  Actually most of the movie is told in narration that is
periodically interrupted to let the whole cast get a chance to speak.
In one scene the action freezes while the actor tells why he is going
to chose to say what does.  I found this extreme narration approach
intriguing, but ultimate tiring.  In fact, one of the chief problems
with CASINO is that at about three hours long, it overstays its
welcome.</P>
<P>     The best parts of the movie are the costumes by John Dunn II and
Rita Ryack.  Ace wears one iridescent suit after another - orange,
peach, lime green, cranberry red, salmon, chartreuse, you name it, but
always with a contrasting solid colored shirt and tie.  To complement
this, the violent Nicky sticks to dull grays and black outfits with
little character.  I think the costume designers are a shoe-in at award
time.  I believe they must have used Crazy Glue to attach a cigarette
to Ace's hand since he has one in every scene in the movie.  The sets
by Dante Ferretti are fun too - full of solid gold rather than pink
flamingos as well as other tributes to the bad guys' bad taste.</P>
<P>     There is no bad acting in CASINO.  Stone plays the most complex
role of her career and amazingly is pretty good at it, but I still
liked her best in BASIC INSTINCT.  Most of her movies have been
terrible, but she does have talent in addition to good looks.  DeNiro
is one of the best actors alive today, but I found Ace to be of his
least interesting roles.  I got tired of Ace after a while.  Woods has
a small but well done role as a wasted loser.  Pesci was a little too
out of control for my taste, but it was a good piece of acting.</P>
<P>     Now about that violence. In CASINO you will get to see heads with
large holes shot into them at close range followed by blood spurting
everywhere.  Bad guys will yank pencils out of people's hands and stab
them in the throat.  You have to endure seeing a man's hand being
smashed with a hammer and the sounds of the bones being broken as the
bloods gushes out.  In the most disturbing of all of the images, men
are killed with baseball bats with the sound of large bones snapping
and blood flowing everywhere, and then you get to see them buried
alive.  You can handle that?  Great, you are certified to see this
film.  Whether you want to or not of course is another matter.  I found
myself watching my back in the parking lot when I left the theater; I
had lost a little trust in my fellow man.</P>
<P>     CASINO runs a little under three hours, but your seat will feel
like it is at least five due to the plodding pace by editor Thelma
Schoonmaker.  The movie is rated R by the MPAA which is is a travesty.
This movies is clearly NC-17.  With the aforementioned heavy violence,
heavy cocaine and alcohol abuse, sex, and constant smoking, it deserves
an NC-17.  I do not think is appropriate for teenagers.  Actually, with
much tighter editing, say an hour less movie and even if they left in
all of the gore, I could recommend this movie to adult audiences with
strong stomachs.  As released, I give it a mild thumbs down and award
it **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
