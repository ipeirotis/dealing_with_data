<P>     One of the most consistent makers of excellent motion pictures 
during the 1980s and 1990s has been Ken Loach.  With a resume 
highlighted by such unforgettable titles as HIDDEN AGENDA, RIFF-RAFF, 
RAINING STONES, and LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD, Loach is recognized as the kind 
of director who will face challenges without backing down.  His 
provocative, idea-rich movies are always populated by believable 
characters, and his latest offering, LAND AND FREEDOM, is no exception.  
With this movie, however, Loach has moved out of his familiar territory 
of modern-day England, turning the clock back to 1936 Spain to tell the 
story of one group who stood against General Franco and his fascist 
supporters.</P>
<P>     The Spanish Civil War was like no other uprising in history.  It 
was a messy, disorganized affair with pro-communist and pro-democracy 
forces fighting each other instead of uniting against their common 
enemy.  This lack of organization among the country's landless workers 
led to victory by Franco, who was backed by both Mussolini and Hitler.  
Some, including Loach, believe that the pernicious influence of the 
Stalin-backed Communist party fostered the divisiveness among the 
revolutionaries that resulted in the fascist victory.</P>
<P>     LAND AND FREEDOM opens in present-day England, with a young woman 
(Mandy Walsh) reading the diaries and letters of her late grandfather, 
who was part of the multi-national Republican Militia fighting against 
Franco.  David (Ian Hart), a card-carrying member of the Communist 
Party, was unemployed in Liverpool when the call went out from Spain for 
support in the war against fascism.  Driven by idealism, David left his 
wife behind to join a ragtag division of one of many local militias 
struggling to defeat Franco.</P>
<P>     There are several gritty battle scenes in LAND AND FREEDOM, but, as 
with all of Loach's movies, this one is impelled by ideas.  It's 
unlikely that you've seen a war movie quite like LAND AND FREEDOM.  
After the militia liberates a small town, they join the local workers in 
a lengthy argument about the pros and cons of collectivization.  It's a 
rich, spirited discussion, and both sides make excellent points.  LAND 
AND FREEDOM is filled with such scenes as characters talk about things 
that mean something, like why they should reject the organized Communist 
army and why they shouldn't moderate their slogans just to gain the 
support of other nations.</P>
<P>     The story unfolds as seen through David's eyes.  This is his tale, 
and, like all epic journeys of the heart and spirit, it involves 
triumph, tragedy, love, passion, and pain.  Torn between supporting the 
organized resistance and continuing to be a part of an isolated but 
autonomous militia, David makes the "safe" decision, then, to his 
dismay, learns the reason why Franco is winning the war -- the 
Stalinists are more interested in suppressing the real freedom fighters 
than opposing the fascists.</P>
<P>     While in Spain, David falls in love with a Blanca (Rosana Pastor), 
a fiery Spaniard who has already paid a terrible price in the war.  This 
relationship forms the film's emotional center, but, like everything 
else that David holds dear, it is endangered by his ambivalence about 
which revolutionary arm to support.  </P>
<P>     Loach directs with a deft hand, and Jim Alleln's script is filled 
with small, unpredictable turns.  Violence is used sparingly but 
effectively, as when a substandard gun blows up in David's face while 
he's trying to teach townspeople how to use it.  In LAND AND FREEDOM, 
death is given a face, and one scene late in the film underscores the 
real tragedy of what was, in Loach's words, "the revolution betrayed."</P>
<P>     For the director, there's a relevance between what happened in 1936 
Spain and what could happen today, and that's why he chooses to frame 
the story with David's granddaughter unraveling his story.  Loach sees a 
creeping apathy enveloping Western society, and wonders whether the 
fires of idealism are dying or dead.  As a wake-up call, LAND AND 
FREEDOM reminds us of the price of fighting for beliefs, and the greater 
price of being abandoned by supposed allies during that fight.  Idealism 
can be a lonely, difficult road when action is required -- something 
that David, Blanca, and all the other members of the Republican Militia 
learn. </P>
