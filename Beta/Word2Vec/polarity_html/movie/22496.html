<P>Denzel Washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very
impressive milestone performances. This perhaps may be Washington's very best
to date. He joins Matt Damon and Jim Carrey in having the talent, this season,
to become his character, copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly. His
very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting "The Hurricane" a
much better film than it actually is. When his Rubin "Hurricane" Carter feels
pain and is tormented by racism, he creates for the audience a great sense of
sympathy, disgust, and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is
our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices. The
horrific true events Carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more
disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago. The
powerful expressions of Denzel Washington alone, as his tortured Carter, sum up
the troubles of racism in America's history. He is that amazing. The problem
with "The Hurricane" is that when compared to Washington, all of the other
actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles. Mainly because the script
focuses so much on Carter, that it leaves little interest or room for the other
actors. This is, without a doubt, Washington's movie but in order for any film
to be completely satisfying, it must utilize everyone in the cast to their
highest potential not just the stars.  </P>
<P>Denzel Washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and
very depressing tour de force performance. As Rubin Carter, we see a black man
whose existence has been a punching bag for the white American court system.
>From the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a
crime he did not commit. Then after a successful marriage and boxing career, he
was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder.
Carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against
jealous, powerful white men who refused to let him succeed. From these past
experiences in jail, Carter realized that he must make his case heard for all
of America. After several court appeals, an autobiography, and many public
marches for his freedom, Carter remained locked in prison. It was not until a
young black boy from Brooklyn being educated in Toronto read Carter's book in
the 1980's, that a serious battle for freedom took place. The young boy and his
three Canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until
Carter is released. </P>
<P>The greatest scenes in the film are when Carter begins to lose his mind after
spending three months in isolation. Washington really shows the breakdown of
Carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again, he is unfairly
framed at the height of his innocent career. The devastation in Washington's
eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to
be punished for it. In the hole, Carter attempts to maintain emotional balance
but he cannot. His anger is heightened to a point of no control. We see
multiple Carters, a violent angry one, a silent passive one, and a mediator. We
see an emotional boxing match inside Carter's head. From this point in the hole
to the end of the film, this fight continues. It is very apparent at times
which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch
from angry to caring or the opposite. When Carter sees that white Canadians
want to help him get out of prison, the angry Carter at first erupts. White
people have been trying to hurt him his whole life, this reminder leads to
anger in his head. However, as the film continues and the Canadians continue to
help Carter we see the calm side him. He realizes that society is changing.
That racism is decreasing and now Carter wants to leave jail immediately and
become a part of this world. Very rarely have I seen such determination to
perfect his role as Washington has done here. If only the other actors had this
same determination.</P>
<P>Dan Hedaya, ridiculously plays the man who sends Carter to prison twice by
forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around. It felt like his
character was taken straight out of a "Scooby Doo" episode; he would have
gotten away with it if it wasn't for those annoying little kids. "The kids" in
this film are the three Canadians who are terribly underused making their
relationship with Carter underdeveloped and unbelievable. The lawyers who help
release Carter also are underused, as is Clancy Brown as a kind prison guard
(the complete opposite of his character in "Shawshank Redemption"). There is a
great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears.
Hedaya was superb in "Clueless," same for David Paymer in "Get Shorty," Harris
Yulin in "Ghostbusters" and Liev Schreiber in "The Daytrippers." It is a
mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles. On the other
hand, it is absolutely no mystery why Denzel Washington agreed to play Rubin
"Hurricane" Carter. This role is about as far off from shallow as you can get.</P>
