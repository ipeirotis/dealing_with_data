<P>     Hey, did you ever hear the one about the really good post-SCREAM teen
horror film?  It seems that some film-makers, realizing there was a new
market to be tapped after the success of SCREAM and its sequel, decided to
make an even better variation on the theme.  The script was intelligent,
the obligatory pop culture asides felt more than obligatory, and the
suspense was genuinely scary.  It was both fresh _and_ frightening.  No,
really, it actually happened.  A friend of my cousin's sister-in-law
actually saw it.</P>
<P>     Sorry, friends, but the preceding is a myth -- an URBAN LEGEND if you
will, exactly the kind which forms the basis of the film of the same name.
You see, the story on the Northeastern U.S. campus of Pendleton College
goes that a psycho professor murdered a dorm full of students 25 years
ago, but the administration hushed it up.  Now, as the silver anniversary
approaches, more nastiness is going on.  A young woman is decapitated by a
figure in the back seat of her car; another is killed in a darkened room
while her rommate lies blissfully sleeping.  All of it is somehow
connected to Natalie Simon (Alicia Witt), a student with a dark secret in
her past, but who is murdering students based on urban legends?  Hot shot
school reporter Paul (Jared Leto)?  Frat boy prankster Damon (Joshua
Jackson)?  Folklore professor Wexler (erstwhile Freddy Krueger Robert
Englund)?  Or some other disgruntled soul?</P>
<P>     If you actually care about the answer to that question by the end of
URBAN LEGEND, it will only be to see how convoluted the explanation could
be.  Like too many recent horror films, this one obliges you to play Name
That Killer, without giving you enough information to permit anything but
a random guess.  And if you think abut the revelation for long enough
afterwards, you'll realize it just doesn't matter.  Memo to horror
film-makers:  we don't need to be guessing who's behind Michael Myers'
mask in order for him to be threatening.  Stop wasting our time; this is a
slasher film, not Agatha Christie.</P>
<P>     Frankly, it's about time slasher films started acting like slasher
films in plenty of ways.  Ever since SCREAM (or even Wes Craven's earlier
NEW NIGHTMARE, if you wanna be picky), horror films have gone all
post-modern on us, eschewing grind-it-out gore in favor of winking
recognition of genre conventions.  URBAN LEGEND's pop culture nuggets
range from the acceptably smirky (a snippet of the "Dawson's Creek" theme
played when "Dawson's Creek" cast member Jackson turns on his car radio)
to the who-cares ridiculous (naming one character after one of the film's
producers), and those are only a couple of examples of the strained
reaches for gags in Silvio Horta's script.  There's just not enough humor
or creativity to compensate for the raw terror lost in forced attempts to
be cute.  Aside from the effective prologue sequence, URBAN LEGEND misses
the boat on providing gut-level scares.</P>
<P>     Ironically enough, it also misses the point that most of the late
70s/early 80s slasher films these arched-eyebrow cousins goof on were
actually moralizing cautionary tales, just like the ones described by
Englund's folklore professor.  When he asks his class if they know the one
about the babysitter who gets a call from inside the house, many movie
fans will say yes...it was called WHEN A STRANGER CALLS.  URBAN LEGEND
nicks from the cine-literate horror of SCREAM without even realizing it,
because movies _are_ our urban legends.  The film might have been on to
something with a killer copycatting other movie murders, rather than
trying to pass off the ever-popular "impaled on the parking lot tire
spikes" tale as part of the collective unconscious, or giving us the
Nanook of the North terror of a killer hidden behind a zipped-up parka.
Pity the talented Alicia Witt (late of TV's "Cybill") for getting caught
up in a horror film that's not clever enough or scary enough to succeed as
anything but a clutch-your-date Friday night special.  URBAN LEGEND is a
tale too often told.  And as one character in the film says, "If you're
going to tell the story, at least get it right."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 sub-urbans:  3.  </PRE>
