<P>As much as I wanted to like this film as I went into it, the more
pleased I was when I left.  First, getting through all the usual lines
of newspaper glitz:  "If you liked Scream, you'll love Wild Things!"
"Campbell gives a stunning performance!"  "This twisty plot will have
you dazzled for days!" (Oh yeah, the day a newspaper uses these is the
day Neve Campbell falls in love with me)</P>
<P>Now, onto more serious stuff (and with this film, I mean that in nearly
a sarcastic way).  WILD THINGS has single-handedly broken down the rules
surrounding the R rating from the MPAA.  I'm not saying that in a bad
way, but when you see this film, you may be shocked by what you see.
However, perhaps the MPAA was pleased by the film's charming cast and
tricky plot, that they let the film slide with an R rating.  Being
Mormon, I'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me
not to see the film.  Trouble is, I have already seen it.  And I like
it!</P>
<P>WILD THINGS is a film noir of the 90s, filled with 40s sensibilities,
and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture.  The
style in which it is filmed is rich in color.  The actors are all
gorgeous people, seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into
this film.  Sure, it's all too good to be true, but ain't it fun to
watch?  When movies like this come along (sort of a better version of
Basic Instinct) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate
it.  There will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see,
but I tell you, most anyone who sees this will like it.</P>
<P>WILD THINGS begins at Blue Bay High School, the one high school in the
world that any teenager would love to get into.  It's almost as if
students are put through entrance exams just for admittance (totally
based on looks alone).  Of course, there are those select few who may
look slightly ugly, but compared to the average person, they are
gorgeous.  Immediately, the film finds its tone and the audience settles
in for an enjoyable time.  We can turn off our brains, right?  Wrong.
While you may be expecting one thing to happen, it certainly doesn't
turn out that way.</P>
<P>The film begins in a classroom, with nearly all the main characters
present.  There's Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon), a counselor for the
students.  He's heading the class discussion.  There's also Kelly Van
Ryan (Denise Richards), a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with
Sam.  Teaching the class, however, are two policemen: Ray Duquette
(Kevin Bacon) and Gloria Perez (Daphne Rubin-Vega), who want to talk
about 'Sex... (Cheers) Crimes (Boos)'.  "What is a sex crime?" Ray
asks.  "Not gettin' any!" one student responds.  This pretty much sets
the tone of the film we are about to watch.  However, upon hearing this,
one student, Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell), stands up and leaves the
room, commenting that they can both kiss part of her body.  And so, WILD
THINGS sets into motion.</P>
<P>Quickly, Kelly begins hitting on Sam, but Sam doesn't want anything to
do with her advances.  Kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him.
She even pleads with him to let her wash his Jeep.  Surprisingly, that's
really all I can tell you about the plot.  Any more would give away one
of the many crucial plot twists.  And what's more, these plot twists are
actually unpredictable.  Going along the way of SCREAM, WILD THINGS
maintains that film's surprises, and then adds even more to them.  There
are more plot twists in this film than probably any I have ever seen.
And even though you think you may get tired of them, the surprises are
so genuine that it's rather pleasing.  Going back over them in my mind,
nearly all of them work, though some stretch the boundaries of belief.
Thankfully, the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about
each one, pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the
previous one has worn off.</P>
<P>As for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well, it is.
This is pretty much just one trashy film.  However, it is the kind of
trashy that isn't hard to watch.  It's good trash, in a sense.  One, the
screenplay knows that it's not to be taken seriously, and it includes a
lot of humor and satire into the story.  This varies everywhere from
Kelly's mother (Theresa Russell), who is more of a caricature of rich
people, all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer (Bill Murray), who
wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running.  Bill
Murray also provides the best character in the film, and most of the
genuine laughs.  And two, the sex is more than gratuitous, although not
unwelcomed.  WILD THINGS is supposed to have sex in it (what film with
that title wouldn't?), and this movie breaks the boundaries.  Instead of
having heterosexual sex scenes, it also includes lesbian scenes between
Denise Richards and Neve Campbell (don't worry... it's not as graphic as
you might think).  The heterosexual scenes are quite graphic, but the
surprise shocker is Kevin Bacon's full-frontal nude scene.  It's very
brief, so if you blink, you may miss (ahem) it.  And, for as long as I
can remember, I don't think I have seen an R-rated film show an erect
one before (it's not completely, but judging from the audiences'
reaction, it was more than they expected too).  Also, during one scene
late in the film, there seemed to be a relationship brewing between
Bacon and Dillon's characters, but nothing came of it (makes you wonder
if the director had to cut it in order for the R rating, or if the
actors refused to do it).</P>
<P>What first made me want to see WILD THINGS was its cast.  Neve Campbell,
of course, has been one of my favorite actresses since the SCREAM films
were released.  Here, however, she turns every typical role she has done
on its head and plays a gothic pothead.  The closest role to this was
her performance in THE CRAFT (though even in that she was a nice girl).
Campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of
talent.  You can tell she will be around for a long time.  Denise
Richards will also be around for a long time, although she may be
limited to the roles without much range.  Here, she gets to express more
emotions than in her stiff (yet effective) performance in STARSHIP
TROOPERS.  Hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can
display her ability.  And then there is Daphne Rubin-Vega, a newcomer to
the movies.  She gives a very good performance, although her character
is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half.  Towards
the end she does get a bigger part.  On the male side, Matt Dillon is
probably the best, giving a subtle performance that surprises with every
twist.  Kevin Bacon has a slightly wooden character, but he makes the
most of it.  You must have admiration, though, for what he did on
screen.  And judging from many of the women's reactions in the theater
to that shot, they have grown a deeper appreciation for Bacon (yeah,
right).  And then there is Bill Murray.  His performance is the comic
relief, and he nearly steals the film.  As a whole, the entire cast
works wondrously together, and they seem at home, even when doing the
menage a troi.</P>
<P>Director John McNaughton, who has previously done the critically
acclaimed HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, has constructed a
wonderfully twisty plot that works.  His direction is smooth and
stylish.  The visuals are striking, filled with rich colors, and almost
so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air.
However, he seems more at home when the actors aren't talking.  His
fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant, and his photography of
Denise Richards' climbing out of the pool is a highlight.  The
cinematography is gorgeous in its details.  Its not often that you see a
film like this, and we should watch it just to see how the camera can
take pictures.  Then, there is the music.  This was probably the most
obvious thing to me, as it set the perfect mood for the film.  It's hard
to describe in words, so just see the film and listen to it.  It's
wonderfully composed and presented.  And be sure to stick around during
the closing credits!  McNaughton has finally put the ending credits to
good use (while most comedies use it for outtakes).  He has included
some small scenes which help explain the preceding events.  Some may say
that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot, but it's an
entertaining way to finish the film.  Plus, there are some shocking
moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun.</P>
<P>WILD THINGS is appropriately rated R for strong sexuality, nudity,
language and violence.  Again, the nudity is rather unnecessary, but
let's face it--people want to see it.  So why not give it to them?  Neve
Campbell, admirably, has a no-nudity clause in her contract, and the
most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off (way to go,
Neve!).  The sex scenes are graphic, especially the first one we see,
between the mother and one of her deck hands.  One almost wonders how
they got away with the R rating.  The language is quite harsh too,
ranging from sexual innuendo to your average, everyday profanity.  And I
can't stress it enough: Don't allow kids under 18 to see this film.  The
target age for the movie is the 18-24 range, and that's who should see
it.  It's definitely not for those under 18!  Did I mention that this
film is rated R?  However, for those that do get a chance to watch it,
you will probably more likely be pleased, and may even take friends to
see it the next time.</P>
