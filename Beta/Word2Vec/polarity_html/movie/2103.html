<PRE>                                NEEDFUL THINGS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Max von Sydow, Ed Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, J. T. Walsh.
Screenwriter:  W. D. Richter.
Director:  Fraser C. Heston.</P>
<P>     NEEDFUL THINGS is the eighteenth feature film based on the
published works of author-cum-cottage industry Stephen King.  If one
adds sequels, original screenplays and television adaptations, that
totals roughly 50 hours of film treatment, about two thirds of which
has been useful only as a mild sedative.  Although to state that King's
works have fared poorly in translation to the screen may be to give him
more credit than he is due, it is certainly true that King on screen
has been far less successful than King in print.  That is not likely to
change with NEEDFUL THINGS.  Lacking the suspense to be a crossover hit
like MISERY, or sufficient mayhem to please the Freddy Krueger crowd,
it treads a soggy middle ground, going for cheap laughs rather than
working up solid scares.</P>
<P>     Set in King's favorite haunted hamlet of Castle Rock, Maine (still
thriving in spite of serial killings, a rabid St. Bernard and two or
three minor demonic possessions), NEEDFUL THINGS begins with the
arrival of Leland Gaunt (Max von Sydow), a grandfatherly sort who opens
a curio shop called Needful Things.  It turns out to be a rather
special shop, one wherein every patron can find the one thing that he
or she wants most in the world.  As a fee, Gaunt asks only that the
purchaser perform a small task, a prank on a fellow citizen.  When the
pranks begin to turn sour, Sheriff Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) begins to
investigate, and slowly begins to believe that Mr. Gaunt is not exactly
what he seems.</P>
<P>     There is the germ of an intriguing idea in NEEDFUL THINGS, one
borrowed from Ray Bradbury's SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES:  what
would you be willing to do for your heart's desire?  Add to that the
simmering hatreds and intolerance beneath the veneer of polite
interaction, and there's the potential for something beyond your
run-of-the-mill gore fest.  Screenwriter W. D. Richter and director
Fraser C. Heston set up reasonably well, but don't deliver.  NEEDFUL
THINGS seems to take forever to get any kind of momentum going, and
when it does at last seem to be moving it runs into a brick wall of
silly dialogue and shoddy acting.</P>
<P>     The latter is somewhat surprising given the reasonably talented
cast.  The performances range from the competent (Bonnie Bedelia as the
sheriff's girlfriend) to the confused (Harris) to the scenery- chewing
(almost everyone else).  Valri Bromfield sneers and swears as a loony
turkey farmer; Amanda Plummer does a New England accented variation on
her standard eccentric; J. T. Walsh seems to be channeling Jack
Nicholson's performance from THE SHINING, but without the charisma, as
the town's pompous leading citizen.  The biggest shock is von Sydow,
who seems completely miscast.  He appears to revel in the campier
elements, never bringing any genuine menace to Gaunt.  It's hard to
stir up any dread towards a character who calls his enemy a "wussy."</P>
<P>     I suppose the blame for that lies with Richter, best know as the
creator of the campy cult favorite THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI.
He seems to have been a poor choice for this job, sacrificing suspense
for silly punch lines.  His black-humored approach to the story just
didn't work.  Similarly, director Heston (yes, _that_ Heston's son)
doesn't quite have the deft touch required to direct suspense.  He does
a nice job with the fantasy sequences as Gaunt entices his customers,
but other elements go completely astray.  He never gives his actors a
sense for the proper tone, which makes it appear that Harris and
Bedelia are acting in a different movie than everyone else.  And he
lays on the atmospheric smoke in Gaunt's shop so thick I thought I
could see it puffing in from off-camera.  NEEDFUL THINGS is muddled,
and in too many of the wrong hands.</P>
<P>     I did find a few moments of amusement, all of which were probably
unintentional.  In one scene, a jukebox skips while playing "Achy
Breaky Heart," repeating the title over and over.  Also ironic is
Harris' statement that "this is a quiet town."  Given Castle Rock's
history in the King canon, "quiet" is definitely not the adjective
which springs to mind.</P>
<P>     I think a line by Gaunt summarizes NEEDFUL THINGS better than I
ever could:  "A couple of deaths, a few explosions ... not my best
work, but what the hell."</P>
<PRE>     Indeed.</PRE>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 explosions:  3.</PRE>
