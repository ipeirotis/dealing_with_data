<PRE>HOPE FLOATS
Directed by Forrest Whittaker
Stars:  Sandra Bullock, Harry Connick, Jr., Gena Rowlands
Rated:  PG-13</PRE>
<P>        A friend invites you to a movie.  This film would evade the
explosions and special effects of standard summer fare, and be grounded
in reality.  The plot is as follows: after a terrifying incident, a
mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move
away from the city.  They need fresh air to get some perspective, maybe
to start over.  Romance begins to brew, however, as one of the locals,
played by an international superstar in rugged clothing, sparks things
up, (especially at a country-western slow dance).  It stars a rising
young starlet, helms a good cast, and is directed by one of the better
actor-turned-directors in Hollywood.</P>
<P>You accept.  You jump at the opportunity to see, what you
believe to be, _The Horse Whisperer_.  But, poor moviegoer, you have
been conned.  Alas, you find yourself watching, incredulously, _Hope
Floats_.  Oh, woe.  Your hope has sunk.</P>
<P>Why was this movie made?  Why was it released?  It is a travesty
on nearly every level, and has the authority to sink the careers of
nearly everyone involved.  At the hands of a better script, the film
could have been a gem.  But it is clueless as to what it is about, and
only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers.</P>
<P>_Hope Floats_ stars Sandra Bullock as Birdy, who, after
discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend
(on national television no less), takes her daughter and drives back to
her home, helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by Gena
Rowlands, (she decorates with stuffed wildlife).  Birdy's nephew, Travis
(played by _Leave it to Beaver_'s Cameron Finley), is under her custody,
and in one of the film's many failed in-jokes, is always seen wearing a
different Halloween costume.</P>
<P>What is the point of this?  Does it make any sense?  Is it
supposed to be funny?  The point of the film is to show that the family
is eccentric, but I was convinced that the grandma should have been
locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child.</P>
<P>All of this undercuts the plot, of which there is none.  There
are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion.  There's the
scene where Birdy, who used to be the prom queen, is humbled by
approaching a peer she once mocked, for a job.  There's the scene where
Birdy dances with her father, in the hospital for Alzheimer's.  And then
there's the sentimental scenes with Justin, played by Harry Connick Jr.,
who is taking a liking to her again, showing her a beautiful pad that he
built from scratch.</P>
<P>And during each of these scenes, I was sidetracked by my earlier
question.  What sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great
pains as to provide a dog costume, a Kermit costume, a cowboy costume
(with whip), and a full furred Barney costume for her grandson to wear
during dinner? What sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the
rest of his life? </P>
<P>Outside of this, there are other sure signs of screenwriters
block.  When the daughter stands up to the bully at school.  When Birdy
almost loses her job.  When the family pulls in a goofy lip-synch to
cheer someone up.  When someone dies.  When the daughter cries, (no,
wails) in exasperation that her father is not coming back.  In a movie
like this, you notice the strings being pushed, and you sit there,
comatose, hoping it will end.</P>
<P>Who can survive such a debacle?  I worry for Bullock's career,
which has been running on auto-pilot for the last few years.  She has an
attitude, a solid perkiness, and can drive a bus--but she can't handle
the emotional scenes, much less hold a Southern accent.  Harry Connick,
Jr. is worse--stick with singing, or get some acting lessons, please!</P>
<P>Gena Rowlands is the best part of the film.  But she's such a
good actress, that it staggers the mind that she's weighed down by such
lukewarm material here.  It would be a severe tragedy if the recurring
star of John Cassavettes' great films is known for this film.</P>
<P>Two notes to Forest Whittaker:  (1) Cut the slow-motion
sequences.  There are twelve times where you undercut your own direction
by such a failed trick.  Have you done so, you could have shaved off
ten-minutes of this almost unbearable debacle.  (2) You've had to know
something was wrong if your cinematographer's filter makes the
candlelight appear like little "x"s.  You're not a bad director, but you
can't change a terrible script.</P>
<P>There's a recurring scene where Birdy, working at the
neighborhood Fotomat, finds the machine go wrong, and image after
destroyed, warped, dark image appear.  Think about it.  A succession of
destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie.</P>
