<P>NOSTALGHIA (director: Andrei Tarkovsky; cast: Oleg Jankovsky (Andrei
Gortchakov), Erland Josephson (Domenico), Domiziana Giordano (Eugenia),
Patrizia Terreno (Gortchakov's wife), Laura De Marchi (chambermaid),
Delia Boccardo (Domenico's wife), 1983-It.)</P>
<P>Tarkovsky in his book, SCULPTING IN TIME, mentions that he wanted to
make a film about Russian nostalgia- "about that state of mind peculiar
to our nation which affects Russians who are far from their native land.
I wanted the film to be about the fatal attachment of Russians to their
national roots, an attachment which they will carry with them for their
entire lives, regardless of where destiny may fling them. How could I
have imagined as I was making this film that the stifling sense of
longing that fills the screen was to become my lot for the rest of my
life; that from now until the end of my days I would bear the painful
malady within myself?"</P>
<P>For that reason, seeing how the filmmaker himself was pleased with the
film and considered it so important to himself, and because of the power
and perfection of craft the film exhibited, it makes it that much easier
for me to say that this film ranks as one of his best works, an
intriguing masterpiece, that is equal to, if not better than his other
masterpieces, SOLARIS, ANDREI RUBLYOV, THE SACRIFICE, and MIRROR.</P>
<P>This is the tale, and it seems almost unreal and dreamlike at times, of
a Russian poet (Oleg) who is on assignment in Italy's Tuscany area, to
write a book about an obscure 17th - century Russian composer,
Sosnovsky, who studied music in Bologna. His landowner sent him there
because he believed he was immensely talented. He was able to live in
Italy for awhile composing, but he soon returned to Russia voluntarily
to face enslavement as a serf, evidently feeling that he would rather be
a slave in the country he loved, than a free man in a country he did not
understand. Something must have gone wrong, because soon after his
return he hung himself. How to understand that, is puzzling to Oleg, who
is deeply plagued himself with family problems and deeply ensconced in a
brooding type of meditation, definetly not Buddhist-like, that leaves
him in a state of disorientation as he tries to discover who he is.</P>
<P>The film opens in a deep fog, as he and his Rubenesque Italian
translator (Giordano) drive in the sloping mountaneous terrain to visit
one of the shrine's that mostly women tourists visit when they pray here
to the Virgin Mary. This opening scene is shot in black- and- white
until the translator enters the church, and then it is shot in a
magnificent sepia and pastel coloring. The visual images of all the
scarved peasant ladies with lit candles and starlings coming out of the
Virgin's body are, indeed, startling. Tarkovsky will use the black- and-
white shots again in the film when he is using flashbacks to show that
he is dreaming or reflecting back on the events in his life.</P>
<P>The first impression one gets, is that he is having an affair with his
translator, but that is not the case, he is so obsessed with his
thoughts that he has difficulty communicating with her, which is
frustrating for her, as she expects something to happen between them
and, when nothing happens, blames it on her poor luck of always choosing
the wrong man. The mood of the film is gloomy, when a laugh is heard or
someone does something silly it is monumental and takes on an unreal
scope. The feeling one gets, is somewhat as if a child, saddened by the
outside world, is nevertheless able to laugh at something he makes up,
and thereby feels good about himself.When Giordano is asked by the
sacristan, "Whether she has come to pray to have a child, or to not have
one," she says, "She is just looking." The sacristan's response is,
"What are you here for, then?" The implication being that a woman's duty
is to raise kids. But what is even eerier than her evasive response, is
that Oleg, who insisted on coming here, chooses not to even go inside
the church. It would seem that he is making a statement to the effect,
that he suddenly realizes, amidst such a religious setting, that what he
wants to find is not outside of himself, that he cannot be a tourist
anymore, he must look inside himself to find what he is looking for.</P>
<P>He meets his kindred spirit in a madman, a former math teacher(Erland),
with gloom and doom prophesies for the world, who locks his family in
the house for seven years for their own safety before someone breaks the
door down and they escape; and, as one guest in the luxurious hotel Oleg
is staying at says, "the child runs out of there like a rat from his
cage." These two hit it off, they see something in each other that is
akin in spirit. At first, Erland is reluctant to talk about what he did,
but when Oleg pursues him to his house, which is damaged and flooded
from a leaky roof, their conversation becomes surreal, as both recognize
in each other that they are possessed to do what it is they seem
compelled to do and nothing can stop them.When Erland gives a prophetic
speech in Rome and then torches himself to death to the accompaniment of
music as his parishoners stand impassively by, and only his dog shows
feelings for what is happening to him, we are struck with feelings of
empathy and wonder about someone who is so sensitive, yet is not
sensitive enough to function in a world that is so apathetic to the
sufferings in others. His suicide is a harsh opinion on orthodox
religion's failing role in getting him to alleviate that suffering, and
how it is quite necessary that we learn ourselves, how to humble
ourself  before we relate to God, otherwise there can be no proper cure
for our disease.</P>
<P>The best and truest lines in the film are spoken by the madman. The poet
is inarticulate, taken aback by his memories and loss of spirit. All the
other people he meets on this journey, he forms only an allegorical
relationship with, whether it's the translator, or churchmen, or hotel
guests, or the Italian workers, they all have little to say to him. The
people are much like the weathermen who can give you the temperature,
but are lost when the conversation takes a deeper turn, they are simply
not prepared to talk about what they do not comprehend. For Tarkovsky,
this film is a lifetime journey, made by someone who is in pain and must
see this pain through for what it is, because there is no going ahead
without taking this pain with him. He must also be prepared to take care
of his spiritual obligations. Since Tarkovsky, for all intensive
purposes, is a projection, at least for this film, of Oleg, as he
envisions his life passing before him, and is in anguish as he sees his
faith being tested; and, as he starts to take hold of his fragile life,
maybe for the first time in his long life,  he seems like a changed
person, who recognizes his melancholy to be a death wish, something that
poetically inspires him, something that is necessary.</P>
<P>Things do not seem so foreign to him, anymore. He knows now that he can
travel anywhere in the world without a translator, as he lights the
candles in the holy water at the hotel and carries out the promise he
made to Erland when they conversed in his house. The flames are
important reminders to him about what he must do to cleanse himself, as
he takes the lit candles over the baths in his cupped hands; he believes
they can burn away the core of the material world and give him hope for
purity and an eternal life. The film ends in light, as through the open
circular window of a ruined church the sun shines in and, metaphorically
Erland's house is transposed in it, symbolizing his divided state. And,
as Oleg begins to meditatively see who he is inside these literary
structures, he realizes that he is whole again, and that he will return
to his native Russia that he loves so dearly, that is inside his blood;
and he knows for certain, now, that it will be there for him, forever,
wherever he goes.</P>
