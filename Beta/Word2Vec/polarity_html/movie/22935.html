<PRE>[MEDIUM SPOILERS]</PRE>
<P>I should have known, damn it, I should have known. Ewan McGregor -
Codename: "Eye" - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat,
bald business-oriented American engaging in illicit sexual activities
in a window across the street. We get the requisite electro-green
through-the-sight view. We the audience, seeing a high tech rifle-ly
gadget, of course think that Eye is going to assassinate the target,
but instead, he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so
hazy, low-quality photographs, which Eye then proceeds to fax and
e-mail to everyone in his target's office. All right, so thirty
seconds in, I was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless
rifle/camera, but I was still open minded... maybe there's a really
good reason for it. I've got reason to believe, you see - I admire a
lot of Ewan McGregor's previous work... and he's Obi Wan Ke-
friggin-nobi for God's sake. And director Stephan Elliot's last movie
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert was a quirky little delight. There's
some genuine talent involved here.</P>
<P>I think at the twenty minute mark, there was still a spark of hope in
my heart.  Eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his
organization's son (I still have no idea what this organization was -
British intelligence?  National Spy Ring? Private investigation?), who
is apparently stealing from his trust fund. He has received his
assignment from k.d. lang, through an elaborate and expensive
teleconferencing briefcase. When Eye tracks his target to an
expensive- looking secluded house, he witnesses a mysterious and
beautiful woman (Ashley Judd) take a knife out and proceed to stab the
poor bastard. OK, that's odd, I think to myself, this could be
interesting. Then she starts to cry, and through her tears exclaims
"Merry Christmas, dad!" for the first time.</P>
<P>So begins our tale of obsession... or... something.</P>
<P>The rest of the movie involves Ewan McGregor's Eye character following
Ashley Judd around to every corner of the United States, totally and
completely obsessed by this woman from afar. Throughout his entire
professional life, he has been a voyeur; so when he falls for someone,
the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes
and cameras. Fine, that's a lovely premise, I suppose. But gosh darn
it, if you're going to go there, you better have some sort of
explanation. And that's precisely where this film fails.</P>
<P>This is the kind of movie that pisses me off. It's an abortion, a
collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely
nothing in the end.  It pretends it is something that it is not - a
surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech
thriller. Here, the filmmakers have confused "surreal" and "deep" with
"vaguely unclear" and "crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors."</P>
<P>I never, even for an instant, had the foggiest idea why Eye would fall
so in "love" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people. The
movie offers only two explanations, neither of which make a lick of
sense. Explanation Number One: The obnoxious presence of Eye's
imaginary daughter, who was taken away from him by his wife some time
ago, tells him he shouldn't leave Ms. Judd.  Explanation Two, which by
the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and
dialog and even the title of the movie: "Beauty is in the eye of the
beholder." Whoo hoo, that helps, thanks a bunch, case closed. That's
as deep as it gets, folks. There is an attempt at an explanation in
the final minutes, which, instead of tying everything together, ends
up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade Mad Lib.</P>
<P>There are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and
serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the
hell the point was. My personal favorites include: the prison-matron
modeled after Austin Powers' Frau Farbissina, who apparently taught
Ms. Judd everything she knows about wearing wigs; Jason Priestley's
awfully played Dirty Desert Vagrant #1, who tries to emulate Dennis
Hopper a la Blue Velvet, but fails miserably; and the
cop-who-sees-Ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and-
then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot. Each one in this sad little
parade is a little more pointless than the last.</P>
<P>The script pays no attention to the laws of time and space. Any time
one of the frequent location changes occurs, the camera zooms in on a
souvenir snow globe, and minutes, weeks, or years could have
passed. Bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole
affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a
slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass. Ewan McGregor at one
point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be
repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell. Jason Priestly
starts philosophizing about sharks, then laughs maniacally... cut to
random guy with eye patch... iguana out of focus... iguana comes into
focus. Wow, man.</P>
<P>When I found out afterward that this film was based on a novel, it
came as no surprise to me. There are plenty of elements here that, if
extended and fleshed out more, would have made for a decent story. And
I wouldn't be surprised if I found out there was an hour and a half of
footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere, or waiting
in the wings for the DVD Special Director's Cut... Not that anything
would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what I was
missing.</P>
<P>The last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the Eye and
the Judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing
exposition. Some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his
cell phone, and this time I didn't particularly care all that much
because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy
crap; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar
to what I was thinking. Someone near cell-phone-guy did eventually
yell, "Shut the hell up!", but it was a lot funnier when we thought he
was talking to the screen.</P>
