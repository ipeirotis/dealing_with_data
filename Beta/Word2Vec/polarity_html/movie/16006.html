<PRE>HILARY AND JACKIE (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Anand Tucker
Writer: Frank Cotrell Boyce (based on the novel "A Genius in the Family"
by Hilary Du Pré and Piers Du Pré)
Starring: Emily Watson, Rachel Griffiths, David Morissey, James Frain,
Charles Dance, Celia Imrie, Rupert Penry-Jones, Bill Patterson, Auriol
Evans, Keely Flanders</P>
<P>Maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled
like the Hallmark Hall of Fame Movie of the Month, because it very well
could have been a manipulative tearjerker, broadcasted on ABC on a
Monday Night, starring Kelly Martin and Yasmeen Bleeth, respectively.
Because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely
why it's so great.  Underneath the to-die-for cinematography, the
brilliant acting, and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of
modesty, not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with
the balls to run with it, tell it in a certain original way.  It doesn't
merely go from plot point to plot point.  It goes from character to
character.  It obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all,
and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts MS and
dies prematurely into the story of two sisters, both musicians, who have
a totally unique relationship.</P>
<P>It's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this
film transcend any cornball, shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it
could have had and makes this, unlike "Patch Adams," effortlessly
emotional and real.  In short, this movie is just awesome.  It merely
tells its story really well, and that's something that just has to be
commended these days, when most stories are botched because they're not
told by great storytellers.  Director Anand Tucker tells this story
well.  He overdramaticizes everything, but still keeps it real.</P>
<P>The film tells the story of Hilary and Jacqueline Du Pré (Rachel
Griffiths and Emily Watson, respectively), two sisters who are first
seen in childhood (played by Auriol Evans and Keely Flanders,
respectively) as the very best of friends.  They are also both
musicians, Hilary a flutist and Jackie a cellist, and when it all
begins, both are considered child prodigies, but Hilary is seen as the
better of the two.  Jackie, a bit jealous, works and works at her
playing skills, and soon the tables are turned.  When they both hit
adulthood, Hilary strives for a comeback, while her sister is playing in
famous halls around the world, but instead of fame, captures the heart
of a hapless, joyful conductor, Kiffer Finzi (David Morissey, in a
semi-star-making turn).  They marry, after a short courtship, and move
to a lovely country house, making Jackie incredibly jealous since her
cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life: when she plays, she
has the eyes of the world, but when she stops, she's alone.  She enters
into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist, Daniel
Barenboim (James Frain), in hopes that she may overcloud her sister, but
she eventually begins to lose it, and runs away to Hilary's country
home, where she hopes to gain admittance by Hilary to sleep with her
husband, since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure.</P>
<P>It's all terribly melodramtic, as you can see, and by the time Jackie
has contracted MS (in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the
breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar "Shine" in technical and emotional
devastation), it would have been the time that I could easily call the
sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn't been handled in such a way.
The key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip
into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship
with her sister, which, I might add, is perfectly realized.  Their
relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year: they
love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world, but they're
also completely jealous of one another.  When a young Jackie surpasses
her playing abilities, she tries in vain to make a comeback but can't,
and almost seems to marry to get back at Jackie for her success.  When
Jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man, she is
jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that I've ever
seen in a film (only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare
share the same man).  And the whole time, their love for eachother is
never doubted or even tested.</P>
<P>Another thing I really liked is Emily Watson's performance.  I usually
make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a
drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease (or any
combination of the three).  My reasoning for this is that it's a fucking
easy job.  The worst case for this very year may be Thandie Newton in
"Beloved": sure, she's good, but what's so tough about playing a woman
who stumbles around, slurs her words together, and acts like a three
year old inside a 20-year old's body?  Hell, I could play that if I had
a pair of breasts.  In that same exact movie, though, is a performance
by Kimberly Elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family
together as her mother slowly goes insane, her brothers run off never to
be seen again, and her mother's lover is scared off.  She has to
actually deal with real emotions, something much harder than mere
stumbling about.  But the Academy of Arts and Sciences loves loves loves
overpraising performances like Newtons.  If you don't believe me, look
at Jack Nicholson's performance in "As Good As It Gets": great
performance, but easy job.</P>
<P>This isn't so for Watson, though, because her insanity comes from real
emotions, not just a plot point.  And thanks to the opening sequence,
where we see her and Hilary as kids, we understand the motives behind
all her actions, and by the time she actually contracts MS and begins to
loose her sanity and her life, we've already understood that this is the
last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses.  Rachel
Griffiths, who would have otherwise been the understudy to Watson's
protagonist, actually matches Watson step-for-step, because as Watson
grows insane, and demands unspeakable things from her, Griffiths holds
her own, and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who
needs emotional help from her.  Griffiths, an otherwise unknown actress
(and Watson being famous from "Breaking the Waves" and "The Boxer"), is
absolutely brilliant, just as absolutely brilliant as Watson is, and if
the Academy and all the other Critics groups, who've already deemed
Watson's performance the best of the year, glance over hers because
she's the one who doesn't get to go insane (read: she gets the boring
role), then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me.  After all,
Griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real - the Tom Cruise
role in "Rainman" (the one who should have gotten Oscar consideration
and not Hoffman).  She does, and if anyone deserves accolades from the
Academy this year, it's Griffiths.</P>
<P>Together, the two actresses work extremely well, though, and both have
to go through deep emotional hell, the likes of which haven't been seen
this year.  If it hadn't been for an otherwise not-totally-great final
section that deals way too much with Jackie and not enough with Hilary
(when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety), I'd say this
is one of the top ten best films of the year.  It's so close to
perfection, in its structure, its treatment of its subject, and its
beautiful technical specifications (cinematography nomination, without a
shred of doubt in my mind, and maybe film editing), that it's nearly a
shame that it's not the flawless gem that it should be.  But, hey, as it
is, I can hardly complain.</P>
