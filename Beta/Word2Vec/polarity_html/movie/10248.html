<P>     AS GOOD AS IT GETS is a perfect Christmas release, not because the 
story takes place during the Yule season, but because many of the plot 
elements are straight out of Charles Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  
There's more than just a little Scrooge in Melvin Udall (Jack 
Nicholson), the most unpleasant man in Manhattan.  And, like Scrooge, 
the unwilling sinner is on the road to redemption.  Instead of four 
ghosts, we have four living, breathing entities (one woman, two men, and 
a dog), but the result is the same.  By the time we leave the theater, 
the warmth of love has melted the coldest heart on Earth.  That's the 
reason this is called a "feel good" movie.</P>
<P>     AS GOOD AS IT GETS is really two related movies in one, which 
explains the surprisingly long running time.  While 138 minutes is fine 
for an epic adventure or a weighty drama, it makes a lightweight effort 
like this seem a little bloated.  The film is ambitious:  it tries to 
wed the modern-day, non-supernatural A CHRISTMAS CAROL with a 
traditional romantic comedy.  Director James L. Brooks, who does these 
kinds of movies as well as anyone in Hollywood, has moderate success.  
AS GOOD AS IT GETS is not a positive triumph, but it does bring a smile 
to the face and, perhaps in some cases, a tear to the eye.  </P>
<P>     Jack Nicholson plays Melvin, a successful author who lives the life 
of a recluse.  When the movie opens, he's depicted as so thoroughly 
rotten that it actually becomes difficult to root for him, even once he 
begins to mend his ways.  He's a homophobic, anti-Semitic racist with an 
intense dislike of dogs (he throws one down a garbage shoot) and people.  
Every time he opens his mouth, something vicious comes out.  The 
neighbors in his Greenwich Village apartment building all avoid him, and 
the waitress at his favorite restaurant barely tolerates his presence.  
To make matters worse, Melvin is afflicted with an obsessive/compulsive 
disorder that makes his behavior seem even more strange.  He brings his 
own utensils when he goes out to dinner, he refuses to step on sidewalk 
cracks, and he wears gloves all the time.</P>
<P>     Then something happens to change Melvin's life.  One of his 
neighbors, a gay artist named Simon (Greg Kinnear), is beaten up by a 
group of robbers.  Simon's dealer, Frank (Cuba Gooding Jr.), forces 
Melvin to care for Simon's dog.  Gradually, Melvin comes to love the 
little animal, and, after discovering a previously-unsuspected 
wellspring of humanity deep within himself, he begins exercising it in 
other ways:  paying a doctor to care for the sick son of his regular 
waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt), and offering Simon support when he comes 
home from the hospital.  Of course, no one can change overnight, and 
there are times when the old Melvin rears his ugly head, leading to plot 
complications.</P>
<P>     Nicholson is wonderful as Melvin the jerk.  He delivers the acid 
one-liners with real venom, has perfected the irritating mannerisms of 
an obsessive/compulsive individual, and generally makes it easy to 
accept the character as the last person you'd want to spend any time 
with.  As the kinder, gentler Melvin, however, he's not quiet as 
successful.  Vulnerability doesn't come easy to Nicholson, and the 
prickly side of his personality interferes with our acceptance of Melvin 
as a new man.  We get the feeling that as soon as the end credits roll, 
he's going to fall back into his old habits rather quickly.  He does 
have some great lines, though.  (For example, when explaining how he 
writes women so well in his books, Melvin comments, "I think of a man, 
then I take away reason and accountability.")</P>
<P>     Helen Hunt, last seen on the big screen in TWISTER but best known 
for her role in TV's "Mad About You", gives real breadth and depth to 
Carol, a woman who lives to serve her son and who doesn't know how to 
cope with Melvin's attention.  Like Melvin, the events in AS GOOD AS IT 
GETS transform Carol, but her gentler, gradual personality shift is more 
believable.  Hunt does a good job portraying Carol's weariness early in 
the film, followed by an almost-childlike joy as she rediscovers 
herself.  Alas, she and Nicholson never really click, which puts 
something of a damper on the romantic storyline.</P>
<P>     The real surprise is Greg Kinnear, who turns in a more solidly 
dramatic performance than we had a right to suspect based on his past 
record.  In SABRINA, Kinnear displayed a feckless charm, but here he's 
required to dig deeper.  Simon, an already-emotionally-wounded 
individual, has suffered a massive betrayal that has robbed him of the 
will to live, and Kinnear manages to capture the essence of this 
individual and bring it to life on screen.  The supporting cast includes 
veteran actress Shirley Knight as Carol's mother, Skeet Ulrich as one of 
Simon's models, and a scene-stealing dog.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, it's the quirks and details of AS GOOD AS IT GETS' 
script (by Brooks and co-writer Mark Andrus), rather than the broad 
strokes, which make the film enjoyable.  Essentially, this is a 
formulaic, connect-the-dots tale which offers few, if any surprises.  
Fifteen minutes into the movie, you'll be able to guess exactly how it 
will all work out.  As a result, the chief pleasure for the next two 
hours is watching the characters grow and interact as they traverse the 
familiar path.  AS GOOD AS IT GETS may not quite live up to its title, 
but it doesn't fall unacceptably short of the mark.</P>
