<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Warning: spoilers throughout review. </P>
<P>Producer George Pal presents onscreen the H.G. Wells story, the one used in
Orson Welles' infamous radio play of 1938 that scared the world. The star of
this film is Pal's special effects, orchestrated by Gordon Jennings, which won
an Oscar. This updated version from the Victorian-era London of 1890 is now set
in contemporary Southern California of 1953. The acting was wooden, the romance
was blah, and the religious messages tacked on were pathetic. But this sci-fi
spectacle had much in it to be praised for; it was especially scary, the Martian
design was sleek and ominous (there were spider-like characters with cobra-like
heads), and the recreation of an Atomic bomb blast was spectacular. It wisely
stuck to the theme of mankind's arrogant belief of his own superiority rather
than go the Red Menace route as most sci-fi films of that day did. </P>
<P>The film opens with the sobering commentary by Cedric Hardwicke, telling
something about the scientific facts about Mars and how the Martians are on the
verge of extinction, stranded on a dying planet. Their only hope for survival is
landing on the green Earth and conquering it. </P>
<P>In a carefully designed plan to carry out their mission, groups of three
cylinder spacecrafts fall from the sky in different parts of the world looking
like giant meteors, with the one falling in the small town in Southern
California of Linda Rosa, about 30 miles from L.A., being of main interest to
the story. </P>
<P>A leading atomic scientist from Pacific Tech, Dr. Clayton Forrester (Gene
Barry), vacationing in the area, joins the crowd of curious onlookers and
strikes up a romantic friendship with a teacher Sylvia (Ann Robinson), the niece
of Parson Collins (Lewis Martin). The romantically inclined couple go square
dancing while waiting for the meteorlike object to cool down before the
scientist begins his observation. But the Martians descend from their spaceship
and zap the three locals guarding the area, who go to the Martians thinking they
could make friends with them. They also cut the town's electrical power and
telephone lines and mysteriously their watches stop working, as the authorities
realize that they have visitors from another planet. The military is called in,
and word from across the world is that they are zapping cities with their heat
rays and are bent on destroying the Earth. </P>
<P>Sylvia's uncle believes he can show them he's a true man of God and attempts to
talk with them about friendship, but he's quickly zapped for his futile effort.
The Army then blasts away with all its modern weapons of destruction, but the
Martians have an electronic shield around their space vehicles and the weapons
have no effect. The authorities now figure that they better come up with
something drastic to save the world and since the U.S. has the Atomic bomb, it
uses it to thwart the Martians. But the Earth's most powerful weapon of
destruction, the bomb, is also ineffective. It seems machines can't destroy them
and as Dr. Forrester, in his deep baritone voice says: we'll find their mortal
weaknesses and destroy them that way. </P>
<P>In the lab the scientists study samples of their blood collected and the Martian
electronic eye Forrester salvaged, which the Martians use as a periscope, leads
the scientists to the conclusion that the Martians are physically primitive even
if they are mentally superior to us. They also have anemic blood and because of
the darkness of Mars, it's 140 million miles away from the sun, they can't
handle a strong light. The religious Sylvia says: the world was created in 6
days and will be destroyed by them in 6 days. </P>
<P>The film's climax occurs as Los Angeles is being attacked and the evacuation of
the city causes a great panic. Barry is disappointed with the selfishness of
humanity and fights through a crowd of rioters who steal transportation out of
the city, he does this so that he may be reunited with Ann in the church she
seeks shelter in before the world ends. In the end, the Martians are defeated
not by science or the military, but by bacteria germs their systems can't adapt
to--or, as the film states, these insignificant things were put on Earth by God
in his wisdom. </P>
