<P>George Little (Jonathan Lipnicki) wants a little brother.  After Mr. and
Mrs. Little (Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis) visit the orphange, they
decide to adopt Stuart, a talking mouse (voiced by Michael J. Fox). 
George isn't so fond of his new brother when Stuart arrives at the
Little house, and neither is Snowbell the family cat (voiced by Nathan
Lane).  George and Stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote
control boat race, but Snowbell wants Stuart out of the house (he's
unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it's
ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat). </P>
<P>Stuart Little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery
(CGI).  The character of Stuart, while obviously a computer generated
image, grows on you as the film progresses and you'll soon see him as
much more than a mere special effect.  There is also a great deal of
animal training involved with this film, as many of the "supporting
cast" are actual cats (with computer animated mouths so they can
speak).  It's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without
an actual mouse to interact with. </P>
<P>Stuart Little is a charming family film.  There are some great laughs in
the movie (with a script co-written by The Sixth Sense's M. Night
Shyamalan no less!), some moments that can only be described as "too
cute" (the boat race sequence is what won me over) and even the majority
of the one-liners (common nowadays in children's films or films
featuring Nathan Lane) are tolerable.  Kids and parents will love this
one. </P>
<P>Stuart Little is available on DVD from Columbia Tristar Home Video. 
There are two different DVDs on sale: one contains the film in full
frame, and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect
ratio of 1.66:1.  Both versions feature choices of either Dolby Surround
or Dolby Digital 5.1 audio.  Both versions also contain the following
extras (and hang in there with me here... there's a lot of them): a full
length audio commentary track by director Rob Minkoff and animation
supervisor Henry Anderson, a full length audio commentary track by the
visual effects supervisors, an isolated score track, an interactive
trivia game, an interactive featurette that goes step by step through
eight of the effects in the film, a making of documentary that
originally aried on HBO, and a Stuart Little read-along story (which you
can read yourself or have Stuart read for you).  </P>
<P>There are also three music videos, and six theatrical trailers (called
TheCATrical Trailers... get it?  It's funny!) for Stuart Little and five
other Columbia Tristar releases: The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland,
Madeline, The Nuttiest Nutcracker, Muppets From Space, and Baby Geniuses
(the only bad thing about this entire DVD... I did not want to be
reminded of the awfulness that is Baby Geniuses).  DVD-ROM features are
also on the disc, including web links and a demo of the Stuart Little
CD-ROM game. </P>
<P>But wait... there's still more!  There's a section called "Basement
Treasures" where you will find the auditions of the film's animators,
six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without
commentary from the director, a visual effects gag reel, a production
gag reel, and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing
the original concept for the boat race scene (with commentary from the
director). </P>
<P>The first commentary track features director Rob Minkoff and animation
supervisor Henry Anderson.  They give insightful and detailed thoughts
about the film's production.  Minkoff likes to point out scenes where
other screenwriters came in and polished up the script, namely writers
like Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (who wrote The People vs.
Larry Flynt and Ed Wood) and Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (who wrote
Splash and Multiplicity, among others).  Anderson is very appreciative
of the animators who worked with him and often points out which
animator worked on each scene as they occur.  The second commentary
track features visual effects supervisors John Dykstra and Jerome Chen
who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film.  Movie
fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track, serious
animation buffs will love the second one. </P>
<P>Now I know this is slightly off topic, but it is related specifically to
this DVD so I must voice this now.  One of the music videos on the disc
is for a song called "I Need To Know" by a group called R Angels.  This
video features four mid-teenage girls (the singers obviously) having a
slumber party.  The girls ask a Ouija board "I need to know... who to
do, who to do, who to do" as the song begins.  They then sneak out of
their house, and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber
party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker
outfits.  Then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys
while singing lyrics like "I'll be your pleasure all the time... just
say the words that you'll be mine".  Um... what the hell?  What does
this have to do with Stuart Little?  How is this in any way a song
suitable for a kids movie, let alone a video suitable for a kids movie
on DVD?  When the video concludes, the words "to be continued" appear. 
Oh I can't wait to see who they've slept with when the Toy Story 2 DVD
comes out. </P>
<P>Kids won't care about most of the special features on this DVD, but
those of us who can sometimes be turned into a "kid at heart" thanks to
a winning family film sure appreciate them.  This is the way to do DVD,
a good movie LOADED with great features at a reasonable cost.  The
Di$ney people could learn a lot from Columbia Tristar. </P>
