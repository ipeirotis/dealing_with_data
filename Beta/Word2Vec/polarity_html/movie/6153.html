<P>     1996 has seen the birth of a new motion picture sub-genre:  the 
Death Row story.  So far, the lineup goes three deep.  Leading off, back 
in January, was Tim Robbins' searing DEAD MAN WALKING, one of the most 
powerful motion pictures of the year.  Following came Sharon Stone in 
LAST DANCE, an overwrought telling of a similar tale.  Now, batting 
third, is the weakest of the trio, THE CHAMBER, based on the novel by 
the only author to rival Jane Austen for recent cinematic exposure, John 
Grisham.  </P>
<P>     Grisham's novels all have a depressing sameness to them, and this 
one is no different.  We have the young, good looking hero crusading for 
right.  Whether he wins or not isn't important, only that he gives it 
his best shot and, in doing so, redeems himself.  Along the way, there's 
probably a pretty (and pretty insignificant) female sidekick willing to 
help him out.  This isn't just the plot of THE CHAMBER, it's the plot of 
THE FIRM and A TIME TO KILL.  And, if you do a little gender-swapping, 
it's also the plot of THE PELICAN BRIEF.  Frankly, when you get down to 
it, THE CLIENT isn't all that different, either.</P>
<P>     Tom Cruise.  Matthew McConaughey.  Now Chris O'Donnell.  These are 
the "Grisham men" -- the good-looking, young actors who play basically 
the same hero.  In THE CHAMBER, his name is Adam Hall, and, as usual 
when it comes to Grisham, he's a lawyer -- but one with principles, of 
course.  His role is to defend Sam Cayhall (Gene Hackman), who's been on 
Death Row for 16 years after being found guilty of setting a bomb that 
killed two children.  His death warrant has just been handed down -- he 
has 28 days to live.  Adam, having traveled from Chicago to Jackson, 
Mississippi to defend Sam, has that long to file the appeals and do some 
detective work.  Otherwise, this aging racist and former Ku Klux Klan 
member will die in the gas chamber.  So why does a young hotshot like 
Adam take such a hopeless case?  Because Sam Cayhall is his grandfather.</P>
<P>     As I indicated earlier, THE CHAMBER isn't so much about getting Sam 
off as it is about Adam exorcising his personal ghosts.  The problem is, 
in order to get him to this point, Grisham toys with a pair of heavy 
issues:  racism and the death penalty.  And "toys" is the right word.  
This isn't a deep or intelligent examination of either -- it's a blatant 
attempt to push viewers' buttons, relying on speeches and melodrama to 
replace an honest, more powerful form of emoting.  When someone in THE 
CHAMBER has something important to say, they pontificate.  Too often, 
dialogue in this film is people talking at one another, rather than to 
one another.</P>
<P>     There's an inherent danger in the way THE CHAMBER addresses its 
serious subject matter -- one that was apparent, but less blatant, in 
the most recent Grisham adaptation, A TIME TO KILL.  It's all part of 
the Grisham formula:  present facile, "tabloid" examinations of 
controversial issues.  The danger arrives if members of the audience 
start mistaking Grisham's simplistic views as thoughtful presentations 
rather than devices to move the plot along and get us to sympathize with 
the protagonist.</P>
<P>     Plot-wise, THE CHAMBER is full of seeming irrelevancies.  The movie 
should have been streamlined better; there's no need to try to include 
virtually every character from the book.  Some of them, like Lela 
Rochon's Nora Stark, could have been cut out with little loss.  There 
are too many tangents that distract our attention from the central 
relationship between Adam and his soon-to-die grandfather.  The only 
"external" character with any real importance is Adam's aunt, Lee (Faye 
Dunaway), who blames herself for one of her father's crimes.  </P>
<P>     Grisham likes defining characters as "good" or "evil", which is why 
playing the racism card is such a cop-out:  by definition, racists are 
bad -- and most of them presented here are downright monstrous.  The 
exception is Cayhall, who we learn may not be guilty at all.  Grisham 
allows Sam to be painted with shades of gray, and, not surprisingly, he 
becomes the most interesting character in the film.  Of course, that 
could also have something to do with the passionate portrayal given by 
Gene Hackman, who comes across as the cream of the crop even in a John 
Grisham movie.  Chris O'Donnell, on the other hand, is flat, and his 
character is dull.  We're supposed to be identifying with this guy, but 
he fails to grab our attention, let alone our imagination.</P>
<P>     When it comes to the actual Death Row scenes, THE CHAMBER is 
especially weak.  Even LAST DANCE was more impressive.  There's no 
emotional power here, and, most importantly, no catharsis.  The end of 
DEAD MAN WALKING put everyone in the audience through an emotional and 
ethical ringer, and there weren't many dry eyes in the house.  THE 
CHAMBER, on the other hand, is mechanical and artificial, and tells you 
what to think.  If anyone was crying at my showing, they hid it well.  
Ultimately, of course, that's the problem with Grisham -- he presents 
shallow, modern-day pulp fiction, so, when he pretends to deal with 
serious issues, it's all a thinly-disguised masquerade.</P>
