<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Carl Theodor Dreyer's emotionally intense masterpiece, The Passion of
Joan of Arc, soundly evokes the passion and resonance of France's
heroine, the soul of her country, who was burned at the stake in 1431
for being a heretic and then in 1920 was made a saint, as if time can
heal such wounds.</P>
<P>Not relying on the standard techniques used in silent films during that
time frame, nor on the avant-garde and Surrealist's vision of the
radical 1920s on debunking the church, the Danish filmmaker, Dreyer,
concentrated on making an intensely personal film, a film that eluded
any known styles. Nevertheless, he constructed an exact replica of the
trial scene for this big budget film, using the style of German
expressionism for his set design.</P>
<P>The Passion of Joan of Arc featured many close-ups of Joan (Renée Maria
Falconetti) and the judges, and used the symbols of the church to show
the extent of its authority. Dreyer records the story of the 19-year-old
illiterate who termed herself as France's savior, who faced her accusers
and challenged their authority. Though the film appeared to be shot
without any long and medium shots, that was not the case. It just seemed
that way because Dreyer, for reasons of getting at the truth without any
other interference, had made isolated shots of Joan, showing how alone
she was from her accusers, and from the soldiers and peasants watching
the trial, and these shots became abstractions, allowing you to think of
them as being solely close-ups. It is because of this style that we are
forced to concentrate only on the main players and on the truth of the
trial, and our attention is not diverted in any other direction.</P>
<P>The genius of Dreyer in assembling a cast that was perfectly suited for
their parts is a major reason for this work of art and critically
acclaimed icon in the history of filmmaking to be as absorbing as it
was. Dreyer chose as his Joan a young French stage actress, known for
doing light comedies. He picked her because under her skin-deep beauty
and makeup he saw her soul and the simplicity of her nature. No actor
wore makeup, every attempt was made to make things seem as natural as
possible. Dreyer was rewarded with his choice for actress, by getting
from her one of the greatest magical performances ever seen in the
history of films. Falconetti, interestingly enough, never made another
film, but instead chose to go back to doing light comedies on the stage,
except for a brief respite, where she repeated her Joan role on the
French stage. The rest of his casting was also inspired, this time by a
mixture of professional actors and those chosen in the bistros, as he
opted to cast for his English general, Warwick, someone who in real-life
was a cafe-keeper. For the evil bishop, he chose Eugène Silvain, who was
a professional actor in his seventies, best known for his work in French
comedies. Antonin Artaud, noted bad boy artiste of the avant-garde
theater and later on noted for going mad, played the sympathetic Brother
Massieu.</P>
<P>The film's opening is a study in starkness. It starts off as a pair of
aged hands turn the soiled pages of an old book; in the next shot, the
past comes alive with the entrance of  the ecclesiastical judges of
Joan's trial. The contrasts between the two shots will be a recurring
theme of the film: historical events will seem to be eternal. As the
judges settle in for the trial, they are shot huddling together,
seemingly in-on-the conspiracy to get the innocent maiden, and on their
glutton faces are the looks of craftiness and hypocritical sympathy for
the girl they are persecuting as a witch.</P>
<P>Joan, the peasant soldier hero of Orleans, who hears God's call to save
France, has been  made to defer from her plans to attack Paris with the
king's full support. When she insists on carrying on her mission in some
outlying cities, she is captured by the French loyal to the British and
turned over to the British to face her trial as a heretic. The film will
only cover her church trial and her execution in Rouen, ignoring her
activities as a soldier and a nationalist.</P>
<P>She is seen in short-cropped hair at her trial, answering the judges
contemptuous questions, as they challenge the voices she hears as being
from God. She is asked, "Do you believe God loves or hates the English?
Joan: "I know nothing about that. Judge: "Was the Saint Michael you
conversed with, naked?  Joan: "Do you think God lacked the means to
clothe him!" Judge: "Why do you wear a man's dress?" Joan: When I have
done what God sent me to do I shall resume wearing a woman's dress."
Judge: "What reward do you expect from God?" Joan: "The salvation of my
soul." These are some of the highlights from the trial, as these
supposed learned men question this peasant girl and attempt to get her
to say that the voices she heard came from the devil.</P>
<P>When Joan fails to respond to the questions as the judges would like,
the judges decide to up the ante. They refuse her wish to be heard by
the pope, saying they are the ones who are fit to serve as her judges,
and they allow her to become a target for taunts by the English soldiers
guarding her; and as an added bit of vindictiveness, they even refuse to
let her hear mass; she will also become subject to the judges' physical
methods of torture. Her retort, is that any confession gained by such
means, she will recant when the torture stops. As a further cruelty, she
is bled and weakened even more. And all the time, the intensity of the
faces close-up and the guile of the bishop heading the interrogation is
stripped to the bare essentials, so that at the climax of each scene, a
meaning is projected into a few stark images-a face, a crown of reeds, a
flock of birds flying away, to the cross being held by a priest, spears
held up by the soldiers, a spike-studded wheel, and a stake being
prepared.</P>
<P>The filmmaking of the trial was so austere; it was easy to believe that
this was the actual  trial taking place. Dreyer's use of the transcripts
from the trial was an ingenuous move on his part, as well as having the
priests tower over Joan, and all the shots of the priests looking and
gesturing to each other, conveying the nature of their evil conspiracy
against her.</P>
<P>One of the most horrifying scenes, that brought genuine tears to the
young actress, was when she was being prepared to go to the stake and
her short-cropped hair was being cut further. The scene was so intense,
that when it was being shot, all the stagehands brought her flowers on
that occasion, and Dreyer made the gesture of taking her tears gently
into his hands in a moving tribute to her performance and how powerful
it was.</P>
<P>Fooled into accepting the judges' offer of recantation, Joan signs a
confession renouncing her errors, but when the church passes sentence on
her, saying they will spare her life from being burned at the stake for
a punishment of perpetual imprisonment, she changes her mind and chooses
death. She tells the judges, "I denied God to save my life." She goes on
to tell them that she is God's emissary, she cannot change her beliefs,
that she was born to save France from the English and carry out God's
orders, and her final victory will be a spiritual one, in the form of
martyrdom.</P>
<P>Dreyer's vision of Joan, was to reconstruct the external reality of
Joan's humanity and depict her only at her trial and show how she is
prepared to willingly die for what she believed in. The film's spiritual
sense of being is layed in the moral rectitude of Joan and her
willingness not to forego suffering. What captures one's imagination
about Dreyer's version of Joan- and this film is almost completely his
version- as he all but ignored Joseph Delteil's slight novel on which
the film was based on- is that Dreyer recognized that Joan ultimately
took a stand for all those who are opposed to social authority and who
are determined to be true to their own nature and are prepared to offer
whatever self- sacrifice is required.</P>
<P>Dreyer's austere, no frills style of filmmaking, using mixtures of
blacks and dark grays to shoot the judges hardened souls and a soft gray
to focus in on Joan, as the camera gets fully at Dreyer's subjects,
leaving no room for doubt that this is a study in contrasts: of the
smug, cocksure faces of contempt on the questioners, the lackeys of a
corrupt political government and an equally venal church authority,
working hand-in-hand with each other, in a trial that was rigged from
the start by the English powers and the French clergy. In contrast, is
the honest gaze exhibited from the close-up of Joan, who seems to be so
much the better of a person than those pack of phonies she is forced to
look at and be condemned by, that we are forced to see how the faces of
evil are contrasted with the face of a good person, and Dreyer's
abstractions, of sticking to the shot he takes until you see what you
have to see, until it grows on you, leaving you with a feeling of real
sorrow as she is finally burned at the stake, in a trial that seemed in
the film as if it took a day or two, but went on for about five months,
in actuality.</P>
<P>This is one of the most memorable films ever made, one that is hard to
forget, as it ends on the bleakest of notes, with Joan burned at the
stake in front of a group of grieving spectators. They begin a mini riot
that is violently suppressed by the presiding English military, as a
rock is seen going through the church window, as the church is blamed by
the crowd for what the English did to her, with the greater implication
being, how the powerful ones still rule the way the world functions and
how the innocent may suffer dire consequences when they clamor for the
truth they hold from within themselves.</P>
