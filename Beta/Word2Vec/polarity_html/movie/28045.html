<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An impactful and meaningful personal human interest drama about the
anxious relationship between two adult siblings who will always remain
close despite their differences because of their tragic upbringing that
made them cling to each other for comfort, when as youngsters their
parents died in a car accident. This film offers a literate script and
is sensitively directed, it's a brilliant debut as a director for
playwright Kenneth Lonergan (co-scripted "Analyze This!"). Besides
writing the screenplay and directing it, he also has a minor part in the
film as a religious counselor. It is so well-conceived a work that it
never feels stagy, as many other films of this type tend to be. The film
was a co-winner of this year's Sundance grand jury prize and recipient
of the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award.</P>
<P>Laura Linney gives a smashing performance as a single mother of an eight
year old, whose conservative lifestyle in the fictional small upstate
New York town of Scottsville becomes challenged when her younger brother
visits after being away for a few years. He is a drifter who pictures
himself as an outsider, who is happiest when he's on the move to far off
places like Alaska. He is played with deep feelings by Mark Ruffalo.</P>
<P>The film opens with Terry (Ruffalo) leaving his impregnated and suicidal
girlfriend Sheila in Worcester, Mass., unable to tell her convincingly
that he loves her, as he heads by bus to see his sister Sammy (Linney),
hoping that he can borrow money from her to help him straighten out the
situation with Sheila and while here reestablish some lost links with
his concerned sister.</P>
<P>The siblings meet in a restaurant, with Sammy worried that she has
recently lost contact with her brother, while he feels out of place and
very edgy to be back in his hometown, a place he finds narrow and dull.
He can't stop fidgeting and acting nervous, dressed in a torn T-shirt
while she's more formally dressed, wearing an outfit she would normally
wear when working at the local bank where she's a loan officer. The
siblings have different personalities and have gone down different
roads, and even though there is a strong bond between them, what this
restaurant meeting highlights is how different they also are, as this
scene brilliantly sets the tense tone for the remainder of the film.</P>
<P>Sammy accepts the limitations of her provincial life, trying to raise
her child the right way, but is instead smothering the sheltered child.
She attends church services regularly, as she seeks out her priest for
daily guidance and wants to believe wholeheartedly in the Catholic
dogma. Sammy refuses to talk to her son about his father or how she was
wild as a youth and one of her mistakes was in marrying the wrong guy,
which resulted in a bitter divorce and her son Rudy (Rory Culkin) never
knowing his redneck father or how rotten a person he really is, as he
instead imagines his missing father in a more glorious light. She also
has an unsatisfying relationship with her on-again, off-again boyfriend
Bob (Jon Tenney), a real nice guy but who doesn't turn her on, and she
is a very sexually turned on woman.</P>
<P>Living a life that is opposite to his sister's, Terry believes what the
church has to offer is a fairy tale. He is someone who can't take
responsibility for having a family of his own or to find direction in
his life, and often gets in trouble because he makes bad decisions,
which results in frequent fights, one of those barroom brawls resulted
in a three month jail sentence in Florida, which is why he lost contact
with his sister, not wanting her to worry that he was in jail.</P>
<P>The sheer beauty in the film is in the natural bonding that develops
between the curiously bright but lonely Rudy and the irresponsible
Terry. An intimacy develops between them that benefits both in their
need to grow up. Their unsettling yet intimate friendship grows from
conversations that seem so natural and from the child needing a
different perspective to chew on besides having only his mother's. The
bad decisions Terry makes are not selfish ones, but are the one's he
makes because he means well but doesn't always know how to do the right
thing. For example, he sneaks Rudy into the local bar to play pool
without his mother knowing about it and gets him to lie to her about
where he was. Terry will, also, on a whim, take Rudy to the nearby town
of Auburn to meet his real father (Josh Lucas), who is living with
another woman. As Rudy Sr. refuses to admit that Rudy is his son, his
anger grows against Terry for bringing him around and the two get into a
brawl, which results in Terry's arrest.</P>
<P>Sammy's life grows confusing as an adulterous relationship develops with
a new bank manager, Brian (Broderick), whose unfriendly wife is
pregnant. He's a twit that no one in the bank likes, as he tries to
enforce in a stiffly polite way petty and meaningless rules. Somehow
Sammy has a penchant for being vulnerable for the wrong type of man, and
mistakes her pity for romance.</P>
<P>Sammy and Rudy touch something about themselves in Terry's short
summertime visit, something they wouldn't have touched that was so real
without Terry being there as a catalyst for change. What the three of
them are all looking for, is something real to believe in. This subtle
drama is satisfying in almost every respect, but mainly as a realistic
presentation of working-class characters who are struggling with the
mundane problems of everyday existence. Their small problems are seen by
them as being gigantic, and their way of resolving them are different
for each. Sammy wants the church to tell her authoritatively what is
right or wrong instead of giving her their feel-good evasive answers,
afraid that in her wildest feelings she can be tempted to secretly smoke
grass or cigarettes, or to have an illicit affair. Her wild nature
leaves her feeling guilty and unsure of what to believe in, as she is
looking for someone to love but can't find anyone in her limited
environment, as she acts outwardly conservative in the hope that she can
be perceived as a good mother to Rudy. While Terry wants answers to come
to him which relate to his particular situation, as he's trying to get
in touch with how he really feels inside himself. In the meantime, Rudy
awakens from his sheltered childhood as he sees for the first time how
the real world can be both a cruel and loving place. He will be through
looking for his real father as a role model, whom he now realizes is not
as he imagined he would be and that he will have to find something else
that is real to believe in or someone else to look up to.</P>
<P>This is a superbly acted and subtle work, whose only flaws are in the
unbelievable romance between boss and worker and the artificial
lovemaking depicted between Sammy and her townie boyfriend, both of
which had no ring of truth to it. But, otherwise, this is one of the
best films of 2000, and indie type of art film with an intensity and a
strong sense of realistic dramatics that brings out the complex
emotional problems of the main characters.</P>
