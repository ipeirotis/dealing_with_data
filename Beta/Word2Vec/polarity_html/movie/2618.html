<PRE>                             CITY SLICKERS II
                       A film review by Hiroshi Saito
                        Copyright 1994 Hiroshi Saito</PRE>
<P>Starring:        Billy Crystal, Jack Palance, Daniel Stern, John Lovitz
Released by:        CastleRock Entertainment
Running time:        Approx. 100 minutes</P>
<PRE>Rating:                7 out of 10</PRE>
<P>     I had a chance to see a sneak preview of CITY SLICKERS II on
campus last night.  I went in with the expectation of a film with the
similar flavor which made the original such a success: personal growth
and insightful humor about life.  I came away somewhat disappointed in
this regard, getting some of the latter and not much of the former.</P>
<P>     The basic plot revolves around Billy Crystal, who plays Mitch
Robbins, turning forty.  He's now become the station manager of the
radio station in which he worked in the original.  He's given a job at
the radio station to his best friend, played by Daniel Stern, out of
sympathy while Stern's character works through his divorce.  His loser
younger brother (John Lovitz) comes to Mitch's house to bum a money and
place to live, all while Mitch and his wife try to celebrate his
birthday. During the celebration, Mitch discovers what appears to be a
treasure map in Curly's (the cattle drive leader in the original played
by Jack Palance) old hat.  After a business trip to Las Vegas,
Crystal, Stern, and Lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of
the treasure.  On the way, they run into Curly's twin brother, Duke,
played by (you know who) Jack Palance.</P>
<P>     First of all, the cinematography was beautifully done, especially
the outdoor scenes in the desert.  The scenes are such that I would
like to see some of those sights filmed myself.  There is some
character development during the film.  The actors remain true to their
characters and play them well, without overplaying the jokes.  The
movie is a good basic adventure, with enough plot twists to provide for
an ending that is difficult to predict.  The movie is paced well, but
with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end.
Humor-wise, the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my
interest throughout the film.  There are memorable moments like when
Stern is bitten by a snake, but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in
the sequel (surprise, surprise for a sequel, right?).</P>
<P>     However, the slight bitter aftertaste I have with this film has to
do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience.  The film tries
to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters
are to each other, like when Mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow
out of his best friend's butt.  This is done again when the gang meets
up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original.
There were also some parts which appeared unrealistic, like whether the
stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn't worry more
about water while tromping around the desert.  Some strenuous stretches
of the imagination are required here.  Since the objective of the gang
is to find gold and get rich (unlike finding themselves in middle age
like in the original), I also found it harder to empathize with the
characters during their journey.</P>
<P>     Overall, I'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous
adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than
the original.  It may be worth the full price of admission, but a
matinee would be a better bargain.</P>
