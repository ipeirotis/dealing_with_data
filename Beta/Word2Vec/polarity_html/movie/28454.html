<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Mamet's second effort as a director, after his diabolically successful
House of Games, is a totally different styled film. It's a Mafia black
comedy, with undertones of being film noir. The director's witty
dialogue and penchant for interesting plot lines are there, but this
film is not as sharp-edged as his other work. It teams the old
Italian-American shoeshine man Gino (Ameche) with the bumbling Mafia
flunky Jerry (Mantegna). The third impactful character is the big shot
Mafia don, Joseph Vincent (Prosky), who bonds with Gino and feels proud
that he has, supposedly, met a Mafia chieftain who is equal to him in
stature.</P>
<P>The film opens as an elderly Chicago shoeshine man, Gino, is approached
in his workplace by two well-dressed Mafia thugs who tell him there's
someone who has an offer for him and that he should come to the address
on the card they hand him; they also hand him a big bill under the card.
The offer, as explained by Mr. Green (Nussbaum), is that Gino take the
rap for someone who committed a murder who looks like him and in return
he will be granted what he wishes. They tell him that he will only have
to serve a three year sentence. At first Gino says no, which irritates
the mobsters, but then he changes his mind and tells them he will retire
in Sicily with the fishing boat they give him. As a token of friendship,
he is given a small silver coin by Mr. Green.</P>
<P>Jerry is on probation with the mobsters because he goofed up a previous
assignment, which means he gets lots of insults and K. P. duty. He is
chosen to be Gino's keeper for the next three days and told this is his
chance to get off Mafia probation by henchman Frankie (Johnson).
Confined to a stuffy hotel room Jerry gets bored with rehearsing Gino's
confession that he will repeat on Monday's court hearing and
impulsively, with big-time bravado, takes him to Lake Tahoe, Nevada, for
a supposedly low profile weekend of gambling and entertainment. There
Jerry is recognized by a limo driver (Macy) as being from the Chicago
mob, and his companion Gino is immediately assumed to be a Mafia
chieftain. He is given the royal treatment by the hotel which includes
free use of their best penthouse suite, unlimited credit for gambling, a
custom-made tailored suit, a manicure, and many other service amenities.</P>
<P>The two get caught up in this mistaken identity bit and all the
coincidences that come their way, as Gino is now known all over the
hotel as some kind of Mr. Big from Chicago. Their gambling venture turns
into the weakest part of the film because it is not believable. Gino
wins $35,000 because the roulette wheel is fixed and then must lose it
back to them with grace. They then attend a comedy show and the comedian
introduces them to two showgirls who end up with them in their penthouse
bubbly sunken tub. This is the entertainment highlight of the weekend
for them. It also sparks Jerry to tell Gino not to get too carried away
that the girls like them so much, "They always like you when you're
someone else." That's pure Mamet dialogue.</P>
<P>The local Mafia chief Joseph Vincent (Robert Prosky) hears of the
mysterious Mr. Big's arrival, and requests him to stay at his mountain
estate as a guest. Never having heard of him, he is about to either
welcome him as a member of the family or have him killed. This scene is
brilliantly done, a true pleasure to watch as the men through long
drawn-out silences converse without saying much that gives them away.
The gestures and the timing of the two is masterful, as the two embrace
after much vague conversational banter and recognize each other as
equals. Gino gives the don the silver coin Mr. Green gave him as a token
of his friendship. Later, by the beach, the don gives Gino a coin to
call him if he should ever need his friendship in an emergency.</P>
<P>Things get sticky when Gino is asked to stay overnight in the don's
house, as he is having a meeting with other Mafia kingpins from around
the country and wants him to meet his old pals. At this meeting is Mr.
Green, which prompts Jerry to steal one of the luxury parked cars and
head to the airport and get back to Chicago. But Jerry runs out of gas,
then discovers he doesn't have enough money to pay for the gas. In an
awkward and meaningless scene that drew no comedy from it, the gas
station owner is about to call the sheriff but Gino pays for the gas
when he borrows the money from the hotel's chief butler (Goldstein). He
just happens to also come in for gas and is in awe of him ever since
Gino told him how to shine shoes the right way.</P>
<P>In Chicago 'things change' as henchman Frankie takes Gino for a walk
near the waterfront, but Jerry decides that he can't live with himself
if he does what his bosses want. He has become attached to this
bewildered, regal old man of honor and lets his emotions do the thinking
for him. He dazes Frankie with a blow to the head, and Gino reacts by
remaining in character and calls the don with the coin he gave him. He
tells him who he really is and what he's up to, again finding the right
words to communicate with his new friend.</P>
<P>There were scenes that lacked weight and seemed phony, but these three
main characters gave this film a brilliance in character study: Ameche
by his brilliantly restrained performance, Mantegna by his energetic and
funny one, and Prosky by his perfectly menacing and touching one. It
lifted the film into a rich mixture of farce, gang violence, and
tenderness. It's a film that comes with a perfect shoeshine and a
perfect smile underneath its ludicrous and cynical premise.</P>
