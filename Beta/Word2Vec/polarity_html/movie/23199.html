<P>     Wildly flawed though it may be, WONDER BOYS has one thing going for
it you just can't take away: a dead dog. Call me a sick puppy if you must
-- in a cinematic environment where you can litter a landscape with human
corpses but God forbid the plucky pooch doesn't make it to the final reel
intact, it's refreshing to find a film with the nerve to off Fido. You
learn something about a film-maker's willingness to take you somewhere
different via these small touches, and they're the kind of small touches
WONDER BOYS sends spilling all over the screen. An inexperienced police
officer leaves his squad car in neutral and watches it begin rolling down
the street. A dead ringer for James Brown chases our protagonist's car,
jumping butt-first onto the hood. A pregnant waitress named Oola wears a
jacket worn by Marilyn Monroe on the day of her wedding to Joe DiMaggio. 
And so on.</P>
<P>     If there had been something more cohesive at the center of WONDER
BOYS, it could have been one of those minor classics of tics and quirks
like THE FRESHMAN. Instead, it's a rambling, shambling, often endearing
mess of a movie about a Pittsburgh English professor named Grady Tripp
(Michael Douglas). The author of a much-praised novel, Tripp has spent
seven years working on the epic follow-up, going through nearly as many
wives as reams of paper in the process. As the university begins its
annual literary conference, Tripp contends with plenty of troubles. His
latest wife has just left him, his long-time lover and university
chancellor Sara (Frances McDormand) is pregnant with his child and his
agent Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.) is pressuring him for the novel. 
On top of it all, Tripp has to play chaperone to James Leer (Tobey
Maguire), Tripp's most gifted writing student but also his most messed-up.</P>
<P>     The aforementioned oddball touches probably give you a good sense for
WONDER BOYS' unconventional tone, but the film's unconventionality
actually goes a bit beyond that. Director Curtis Hanson (L.A. 
CONFIDENTIAL) and screenwriter Steve Kloves (AWOL from the big screen
since FLESH AND BONE in 1993) give the story a pacing that can best be
described as unhurried. It's almost as though the filmmakers treat 
everything as though it's seen through the eyes of Tripp, whose fondness
for the ganja cannot be overstated. Douglas, who has never been shy about
taking on characters with an unpleasant side, gives a good-natured
performance as a guy who becomes ever-more-dilapidated over the course of
the film. It's an odd sort of comedy that's based on watching a man fall
apart while he slowly figures out he needs to pull himself together.</P>
<P>     All those moments in such a leisurely, unpretentious package should
have added up to first-class fun, but somehow WONDER BOYS never quite gets
there. More to the point, it doesn't leave you with the impression that
first-class fun was the object in the first place. The story keeps
flitting back to Tripp's indecision regarding whether to attempt a
reconciliation with his wife or commit to Sara, eventually reaching a
resolution that involves Tripp's final choice. Suddenly you're left with
the sensation that WONDER BOYS was really about a 50-year-old adolescent
just learning how to grow up, which leaves you wondering why development
of Tripp's character was so haphazzard. It's one thing to enjoy a casual
story about the exploits of a casual character. It's a bit more
frustrating when you realize something serious was supposed to come out of
it.</P>
<P>     It's particularly frustrating when nothing about the first 90 minutes
of the film suggests any of the characters were meant to be taken
seriously. That's not to say it's not enjoyable to spend time with them;
Downey, McDormand and Maguire all craft convincing characters. There's
just not enough weight to WONDER BOYS for it to support a moral to the
story. The relationship between Tripp and Leer is resolved to abruptly,
the relationship between Tripp and his affectionate student tenant (Katie
Holmes) isn't developed at all and the Tripp/Sara connection always feels
too nebulous for its ultimate resolution to matter. It's possible to spend
most of WONDER BOYS grinning at its nonchalance, its goofiness and its
small pleasures. Once you reach the end, you may be wishing that a film
with the nerve to kill the dog also had the nerve to resist the tidy
happily-ever-after of the man who learns What Really Matters.</P>
