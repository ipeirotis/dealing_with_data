Eckhart, Crispin Glover, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Alison Janney, Tia Texada, 
Kathleen Wilhoite</P>
<P>The summer of 00' wasn't a very good one for devout cinephiles. It offered no 
BLAIR WITCHES or SIXTH SENSES; the best big budget Hollywood could do was an 
efficient X-MEN adaptation and a flawed but entertaining SHAFT update. NURSE 
BETTY signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the 
commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season, that 
battery-charging (at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o' 
shit that moseys into multiplexes) time of year when all those Oscar 
Contenders (read: "quality" films) compete for audiences. Alas BETTY has the 
dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new 
season. It's also indie director Neil LaBute's first attempt at something 
resembling a mainstream picture, and I'm sad to report it's a resounding 
failure (at least on this web site), a mess that's as hopelessly saccharine 
as people have accused LaBute's previous films of being unrelentingly 
masochistic.</P>
<P>I went in expecting something decent, for BETTY was gleefully praised, it's 
screenplay even winning an award at CANNES, but I exited shaking my noggin in 
bewilderment. Are critics so desperate for something unique that they're 
blind to how derivative the particular brand of "uniqueness" BETTY dolls out 
is? For the first time LaBute is working from a script he has not written, 
and he seems unsure of how to handle the material. BETTY tries to be hip like 
PULP FICTION (this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and 
articulate hit men), enchanting like THE WIZARD OF OZ (of which this film 
makes several allusions to) and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite 
loveable misfit movie], but by the end it left me cold with its calculated 
desperation. It's LaBute's half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and 
he doesn't even seem to have half that heart in it.</P>
<P>NURSE BETTY concerns a soap opera addict, Betty (brilliantly played by Renee 
Zellweger), who witnesses the killing of her husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart 
playing the most casually loutish husband since Richard Benjamin in DIARY OF 
A MAD HOUSEWIFE) by two hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock). She happens 
to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two 
realities. She's blocked out her husband's death and thinks she's a character 
in her favorite soap, A REASON TO LOVE. Betty sets out on the road to LA 
(with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk) searching for her soap 
boyfriend Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear) while the two bickering hit men 
follow in not so close pursuit.</P>
<P>The LaBute who birthed the extraordinary IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, slipped a bit 
(but not much) with his sophomore effort, YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, then 
fell straight on his ass with BASH, a play he penned that was recently aired 
on SHOWTIME. The play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist, only 
LaBute's persistence in wallowing in the horrid things "average" people do to 
each other, usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are. In the 
play, Paul Rudd, as an obnoxious jock, delivers a monologue detailing how he 
once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death, while 
his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as 
something along the old maxim "boys will be boys". Another character, 
schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his 
own baby! What was once so powerful about LaBute's work, the casual, 
nonchalant cruelty and selfishness (often elements we all have in us 
amplified to a disgusting degree) had become so over the top it was 
borderline comic. Obviously, at this point, LaBute could use a dose of some 
different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further, but NURSE 
BETTY isn't it. He clearly has little passion for what he's doing here, 
instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks (one of the hit men is a huge 
soap fan, and the character of Betty would be little more than a one joke 
gimmick if Zelllweger hadn't managed to transcend that) tailor made to appeal 
to the widest possible audience.</P>
<P>Nearly every scene between Chris Rock and Morgan Freeman fatally slows the 
picture down, as the two are made to enact soft-boiled Tarantino-esque 
dialogue. They evince little chemistry, with Rock constantly in over the top 
rant mode, acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit 
man (an occupation that's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays). 
I think Rock is a great comic yet he hasn't been able to bring his feral 
intelligence to movies, whenever he acts, and no matter the part, it's like 
he's doing the damn CHRIS ROCK SHOW. Surprisingly (at least considering her 
work in ME, MYSELF AND IRENE) Renee Zellweger gives a revelatory performance, 
building on her baby faced, apple pie looks. That wide-open face and helium 
voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her 
thirty-year-old body. It's the best work she's ever done.</P>
<P>Freeman is effective as always, though his performance nonetheless suffers 
because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it. The actor 
plays the role in his usual calm, collected manner, though the flick tries to 
insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and Betty's, suggesting 
that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality. That's 
interesting but the movie doesn't do anything with it other than crash land 
the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle.</P>
<P>The film has good moments (many of the scenes involving a very good Greg 
Kinnear, especially his confrontation with Zellweger), an almost soothing, 
lyrical score (and you know a movie's in trouble when the score sticks out as 
one of the best things about it) but nothing jells, it's parts, good or bad, 
are so disparate as to be opposing. The film might have worked had it settled 
on being one type of film, a mainstream, female FORREST GUMP or an oddball 
art film, but as both if it falls as flat as Diet Coke. BETTY's screenplay 
makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence, without which Betty 
wouldn't make any progress in the film. NURSE BETTY is a film driven by 
coincidence rather than charter, like how Betty becomes a nurse in the film, 
a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover; she 
happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting 
takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim's wound 
because she happened to see how on TV, which leads to her being offered a 
room with the victim's girlfriend who eventually gets Betty into a party 
where she meets Kinnear… a little too tidy, don'tcha think.</P>
<P>BETTY has an interesting theme, though it doesn't even seem aware of this. 
The current state of TV has been leaning towards reality television what with 
the enormous success of SURVIVOR and moderate success of BIG BROTHER, with 
more on the way. This is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her 
favorite soap opera is reality (ironically real-life SURVIVOR Sean Kennif has 
taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera GUIDING LIGHT). Instead of 
exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current TV craze (since 
the film does largely appear to be a satire of Television, albeit one that 
would feel more appropriate in the '80s than the '00s), the film simply uses 
Betty's delusions as a plot device to get her from point A to B. No progress 
is made and little is unearthed except that maybe LaBute could use a bit of 
rest and a lot of contemplation.</P>
