<P>     All right, admit it: The credits "Written and directed by Sofia
Coppola" don't exactly set the heart racing in anticipation of artistic
triumph. Your defining image of Sofia Coppola probably involves her
single-handedly making THE GODFATHER PART III painful to watch. Or maybe
you go back farther, to her script credit on the lifeless "Life With Zoe" 
segment of NEW YORK STORIES.  If so, then consider this (perhaps faint) 
praise for THE VIRGIN SUICIDES: Sofia shows more visual flair in her
directorial debut than Papa Francis has managed to show in the last 20
years or so.</P>
<P>      If only she had managed a bit more story sense. Based on Jeffrey
Eugenides' novel, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES is the story of the five Lisbon
sisters -- Bonnie (Chelsea Swain), Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Mary (A. J. Cook),
Therese (Leslie Hayman) and Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall) -- children of
strictly religious parents (Kathleen Turner and James Woods) in mid-1970s
Michigan. The girls inspire fascination in their male peers, but the
fascination grows even more intense when the youngest girl, 13-year-old
Cecilia, throws herself from a second floor window onto an iron fence
spike. The family retreats even more after the incident, but that doesn't
stop the flirtatious Lux from trying to find some semblance of a normal
adolescence -- including deceiving her parents.</P>
<P>     Stylistically, Coppola does plenty to keep the film interesting. 
There are few gimmicks she's unwilling to employ: slow-motion, split
screens, odd angles. She also crafts one extremely effective sequence at a
homecoming dance that captures every nuance of adolescent romantic
fumbling. Her approach shows Coppola understands that THE VIRGIN SUICIDES
is not a simple narrative, but a flashback remembrance of pubescent
fantasy. The girls are representations of idealized visions by the story's
collective male narrator (given voice by Giovanni Ribisi), not
fully-realized characters -- and that's fine. THE VIRGIN SUICIDES is
effective at creating a coming-of-age dreamscape where the tranquility of
suburbia collides with the inherent turbulence of youth.</P>
<P>     Sounds good on paper, doesn't it? It's true that Coppola gives THE
VIRGIN SUICIDES just the right atmosphere, but she never manages to latch
onto anything that would give the story focus or momentum. Her biggest
mistake is making arbitrary use of the novel's structure as a remembrance
told from a distance of many years, much of it through imperfectly 
recalled interviews with key players. In one scene she shows an adult Trip
Fontaine (Michael Par) describing his fling as a teenager (Josh Hartnett) 
with Lux. It's a great scene -- effectively demonstrating the lasting
effect the Lisbon girls had on those around them -- but it also serves to
show how much better the film would have been with more moments like it. 
The tale's young male observers also disappear for long stretches,
allowing the film to drift into trite suburban family drama. On the page,
THE VIRGIN SUICIDES was hypnotic and mysterious; on the screen, it's a
collection of eye-catching individual moments that too rarely coalesce
into something more profound.</P>
<P>     In a cinematic climate where films about adolescents usually bear
little resemblance to reality, it's refreshing to find a film-maker
interested in capturing the tangled emotions of that time. Sofia Coppola
is working from a fundamentally strong source, and she has put together a
cast and crew that make THE VIRGIN SUICIDES worth watching (and worth
listening to, with its sublimely kitschy soundtrack of period tunes by
ELO, Styx and Heart). When it latches on to those moments of wonder at the
emerging adulthood of the opposite sex -- one boy's wide-eyed discovery of
feminine hygiene products in the Lisbon bathroom, for instance -- it's
dead on target. Unfortunately, there's also too much of the mundane in
Coppola's adaptation. If she develops as much instinct for storytelling as
she does for directing, Sofia Coppola could be a film-maker to watch
for. And there's a prospect I'll bet you never expected.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Sofia's choices:  6.</PRE>
