<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>For a Hammer film, this one is as good it gets for them. It's a bizarre
psychological story with lots of Hitchcock's Psycho in it. It's a
disturbing film about a hostage situation involving an insane religious
fanatic. Tallulah Bankhead plays the Bible quoting nut Mrs. Trefoile, in
an over-the top performance that is frightening to behold.</P>
<P>The attractive Pat Carroll (Powers) is returning to London with her soon
to be husband, Alan Glentower (Maurice Kaufmann), and instead of
spending the night with him as he wishes, she plans to take a drive in
the country and pay a short visit with the mother of the boy she was
previously engaged to. Steven was her only son and committed suicide, so
out of politeness Pat feels obliged to pay Mrs. Trefoile a courtesy
call.</P>
<P>Little does she realize what she is getting herself into. When she meets
Mrs. Trefoile for the first time, she quickly determines the woman is as
nutty as a fruitcake. She is always preaching the literal word of the
Bible at the shocked Pat, making her attend lengthy private church
services in the house, forcing her to wear no lipstick, not allowing
mirrors in the house, and not allowing condiments to be served with the
meal. The servants she has surrounded herself with are either crazy or
perversely evil. Anna (Yootha) is married to Harry (Vaughan), who lied
to the old lady that he's a relative on her deceased husband's side. He
has worked for her the last 16 years planning to rip her off and inherit
her wealth when she dies. The other worker is the mentally impaired
Joseph (Sutherland), who is clueless about anything.</P>
<P>When Pat plans to leave after her unpleasant overnight stay, she is
locked in her room after foolishly telling her about her new fiancé.
She's told by Mrs. Trefoile that she must be redeemed for her son in
heaven and be saved from her sinful soul. That there is still hope for
her because she's still a virgin. She considers her to be Steven's wife
forever and will not permit her to ever leave and be with another man
again. Soon she ups the stakes and goes for a human sacrifice.</P>
<P>The tacky hostage situation forces the frightened Pat to come up with
all sorts of plans to escape this madhouse, but they all prove to be
futile. It isn't until her knight in shining armor, Alan, comes to
rescue her and her Mercedes.</P>
<P>This Grand Guignol piece is excellently scripted by Richard Matheson,
from the novel "Nightmare" by Anne Blaisdell. As crazy as the tale was,
it all seemed possible.</P>
