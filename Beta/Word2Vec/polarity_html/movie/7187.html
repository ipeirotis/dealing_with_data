<P>     You can bet that Sony Pictures executives have spent plenty of time
in the last few weeks hoping that there is, in fact, no such thing as bad
press.  Rumors of on-set tension have been swirling for months, production
delays bumped the film from its higher-profile fall '96 release date, and
reports had the budget creeping into the $90 million range.  Then, in a
Newsweek interview, Brad Pitt took a few shots at the mid-stream script
changes on his upcoming film THE DEVIL'S OWN, inspiring the kind of spin
control usually seen only on the teacup ride at Disneyland.  Pitt's
comments were surprising in an era when stars are generally obliged to
swoon over their latest project, but it may be even more surprising to see
the end product of the process which frustrated him so.  THE DEVIL'S OWN
is an uncommonly thoughtful suspense film with a razor-sharp performance
by Pitt, proving that Pitt's standards may be considerably higher than
anyone else's in Hollywood.  If anything, it is the missed opportunities
for even more detailed characterizations which end up disappointing.</P>
<P>     Pitt plays Frankie McGuire, a native of Northern Ireland with a
haunted past and a challenging present.  A man who watched as a young boy
while his father was gunned down as a Republican sympathizer, Frankie has
become a notorious IRA terrorist wanted for several bombings and murders.
With superior government firepower threatening to overwhelm them, the IRA
sends Frankie to the U. S. to purchase black market missiles for their
effort.  Aided by American friends, Frankie comes to New York under the
name Rory Devaney, and is put up in the home of unsuspecting veteran cop
Tom O'Meara (Harrison Ford).  Rory soon becomes close with the O'Meara
family, but they are all put at risk when complications develop in the
transaction with arms dealer Billy Burke (Treat Williams).  Soon two men
with differing concepts of duty will be set not just against a common
enemy, but against each other.</P>
<P>     THE DEVIL'S OWN clearly wants to establish a father-son dynamic
between Tom (who has three daughters but no sons) and Rory, and it works
primarily because it never strains too hard to make the point.  The
bonding between them is casual and un-dramatic -- a game of pool here, a
snippet of conversation there -- and director Alan J. Pakula trusts the
actors to establish a connection without resorting to trite dialogue or
inappropriate outbursts of emotion.  These are two quiet, determined men
who simply seem to like each other and enjoy each other's company.</P>
<P>     We like them, too, and for quite a while both of them are the heroes
of THE DEVIL'S OWN...until Pitt kicks his performance into another gear.
Though the film's opening scenes show Frankie in a gun battle with
government troops in Belfast, we come to believe that the soft-spoken man
in New York is the "real" Frankie/Rory.  That man is as fictional as
"Rory Devaney," however, the man Frankie might have been if he had lived
another life.  He turns utterly ruthless when his back is against the
wall, and Pitt gives him the weariness of a man who cannot afford the
luxury of a conscience.  Pitt plays the anti-hero to Ford's more
conventional square-jawed hero, and it is hard to choose sides between
them.  It is a unique conflict for a Hollywood film, a struggle between
two people whose moralities were determined by their circumstances, and
who both believe firmly that they are in the right.</P>
<P>     In a film with such an unconventional struggle at its center, it is
all the more jarring when conventional formula elements rear their ugly
heads.  Obligatory psycho-villain Treat Williams gets to ooze malevolence
and serve up severed heads; obligatory romantic interest Natascha McElhone
gets to be gorgeous and supportive of Frankie.  There is a distracting
sub-plot as well, concerning the involvement of Tom's partner Eddie (Ruben
Blades) in the shooting of a car thief, which serves only as yet another
reminder that Tom is honest, hates violence, and believes in the letter of
the law.  When THE DEVIL'S OWN begins to resemble low-rent DIE HARD
clones, it drifts.</P>
<P>     Those occurrences are relatively rare, however, because THE DEVIL'S
OWN doesn't move the way you expect suspense thrillers to move.  The
action sequences are infrequent but emphatic, with a premium placed on the
patient establishment of character.  Still, there is a moment late in THE
DEVIL'S OWN (during a climax reportedly re-shot just a few months prior to
opening) which may be an example of what Pitt was complaining about to
Newsweek.  In that scene, Tom suggests that he never wanted to be a cop, a
sub-text which appears out of nowhere and might have given more depth to
the character throughout the film.  There are certainly instances where
THE DEVIL'S OWN feels like the product of a script-by-committee, but the
star power of Ford and Pitt in an intriguing relationship guides it over
its rough points.  I could only hope to be subjected to more "troubled
productions" like this.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 lucky devils:  7.</PRE>
