<P>     Over the past few years, while most studio event films were growing
bigger, louder and dumber, the folks at Disney were doing something
terribly underhanded with their animated features.  Like cereal makers
injecting twelve essential vitamins and minerals into our Frosted Sugar
Bombs, they were slipping competent story-telling into our entertainment.
In films like POCAHONTAS, TOY STORY and THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, the
Mouse gave our unsuspecting children reason to expect thematic depth,
complex villains and appealing heroes even while they were being amused
and dazzled.</P>
<P>     It's all terribly insidious, this raising of expectations, and not
just for audiences.  Expectations in the Disney boardroom were raised by
the $530 million in domestic grosses racked up by ALADDIN and THE LION
KING, making the mere $140 million for POCAHONTAS and $100 million for
HUNCHBACK look like chump change.  Perhaps, Uncle Walt's successors may
have concluded, audiences would rather eat a salad when they want their
twelve essential vitamins and minerals.</P>
<P>     All this being prologue to the observation that HERCULES, a frisky
and energetic offering from directors John Musker and Ron Clements (who
helped revive the moribund Disney animation empire with the frisky and
energetic THE LITTLE MERMAID and ALADDIN), is merely a pleasant way to
spend a Saturday afternoon.  It's a typically Disney-loose version of the
Greek myth of Hercules (right down to giving him the Roman name rather
than the Greek Heracles) in which the young hero (Tate Donovan) must prove
his mettle by foiling the evil plans of Hades (James Woods), lord of the
underworld.  Assistance comes in the form of a hero-training satyr named
Phil (Danny DeVito); trouble comes in the form of a tough-talking woman
named Meg (Susan Egan) who may or may not be on Herc's side; comic relief
comes in the form of Hades' two inept assistants, Pain (Bobcat Goldthwait)
and Panic (Matt Frewer).</P>
<P>     No trouble so far...in fact, there's quite a bit to recommend
HERCULES.  British cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, who acted as production
designer, gives HERCULES a distinct look full of sharp angles and stylized
characterizations which separates it from other recent Disney efforts.
There are a couple of very catchy tunes by Disney stalwart Alan Menken and
new lyricist David Zippel, including a wonderful Brill Building-style love
song called "I Won't Say."  Musker and Clements also trot out the kind of
pop culture references which worked so well in ALADDIN, including quotes
of THE KARATE KID, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH as well as some
deft satire of over-saturated merchandising.</P>
<P>     If HERCULES had come up with a heart to match its art, it might have
been deserving of that "masterpiece" label Disney affixes indiscriminately
to its animated features.  It starts out with promise, presenting the
adolescent Hercules (voiced by Joshua Keaton and perfectly rendered as a
gawky jumble of massive hands and feet) as the quintessential teen-age
outsider.  The arc of his character takes him, as one song title describes
it, from "Zero to Hero," but the screenwriting team isn't interested in
digging into how he deals with his fame, or how he is chastened by his
failures.  It's not exactly a redemption story, not exactly a quest story,
and not exactly a love story.  It is, quite simply, a cartoon.</P>
<P>     The fact that there's anything remotely dismissive about that term
shows how far Disney has raised the bar on animated film-making.  Even
HERCULES, which comes up short in defining its hero, delivers complex
supporting characters like Meg (a superb vocal performance by Susan Egan)
with real emotions.  After recent Disney triumphs, however, we know that
more is possible.  Children will probably be more delighted by HERCULES
than by the darker HUNCHBACK, and adults will probably enjoy James Woods'
oily wheeler-dealer manner as Hades (we all knew that the devil was really
an agent).  HERCULES is one of the better entertainments of the summer, a
big tasty bowl of Frosted Sugar Bombs.  If you want your vitamins this
time, you'll have to order a side salad with that.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Grecian formulas:  7.</PRE>
