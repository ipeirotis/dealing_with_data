Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     For those unfamiliar with the American legal system -- and count it
among your blessings if you are one of them -- it is not generally the
stuff of which great drama is made.  It is a thing of motions, pleadings,
depositions and causes of action, of hundreds of hours spent reading
thousands of incoming documents, or redacting thousands of outgoing
documents.  It is a war of attrition played out in conference rooms, only
rarely involving tense attorney-witness confrontations or even-more-tense
waits for a verdict.  Cinematic law is a satisfying fiction; real law is,
for the most part, a laborious game of chicken before an out-of-court
settlement.</P>
<P>     A CIVIL ACTION's dubious merit involves the extent to which it
effectively captures real law.  It's based on a real case, recounted in
Jonathan Harr's non-fiction best-seller about Jan Schlichtmann (John
Travolta), a Boston personal injury lawyer with a gift for turning the "s"
in "suffering" into a dollar sign.  He sees no such dollar signs in a case
brought in by his partner Kevin Conway (Tony Shalhoub), a case involving a
statistically significant cluster of children dying of leukemia in the
town of Woburn...that is, until he discovers that the toxic chemicals in
the area just may be spilling out of the deep pockets of R.W. Grace Corp.
and Beatrice Foods.  Schlichtmann smells a killing, and the Woburn case
comes to consume everything he has and everything he is.</P>
<P>     There was every reason to believe that, if anyone could lend a spark
to slogging through the legal mire, it would be Steven Zaillian.  This
was, after all, the director who made chess both kinetic and poetic in
SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER.  Indeed, there are several scenes in which
Zaillian nails the harsh truths of tort law:  Schlichtmann coldly ticking
off the relative cash values of women vs. men or black vs. white in
wrongful death cases; a hilarious courtroom moment in which a corporate
defense attorney realizes he's lost the jury's sympathy before he's even
begun; an effective montage showing the mounting costs of research and
expert witnesses.  A CIVIL ACTION pulls few punches when it comes to
underlining a process that's always about money, and only accidentally
about justice.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, it pulls all its punches when it comes to giving the
story an emotional hook.  Schlichtmann's conversion from shark to softy is
supposed to anchor the film, except that it's far too subtle.  In fact,
Travolta often plays Schlichtmann as though his concern is always still
about the money, his frustration less about letting his clients down than
about letting the big one slip away -- which, frankly, is a more
interesting choice.  Those clients, meanwhile, remain stoic, heroic
abstractions, the working class American equivalent of the struggling
non-white characters who serve as background color in stories of a wealthy
white character's awakening to social conscience (like SEVEN YEARS IN
TIBET).  As the film slowly becomes the story of how the Woburn case
drains all the cash out of Schlichtmann and his firm, it slowly drains
what little narrative and visual energy it had.</P>
<P>     Certainly much of that energy was supposed to be provided by Robert
Duvall as Jerry Facher, Beatrice's eccentric veteran attorney.  I suppose
the idea is that he's wily because he passes himself off as such a goof,
but the character's tics -- taping up an ancient briefcase covered in
Snagglepuss decals; absently bouncing a ball during a phone conversation;
obsessing over the Red Sox -- are more often distracting than they are
entertaining.  At least Duvall's fussy colorfulness, along with William H.
Macy's less-mannered breakdown as Schlichtmann's nervous accountant, give
you something to watch.  Too often A CIVIL ACTION feels like the sort of
lecture in legal maneuvering we see Facher give to students at Harvard
Law.  It runs out of gas when it runs out of things to tell us, since it
lacks characters to engage us.  Real law makes the appeal of John
Grisham-esque courtroom melodrama make a lot more sense.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 punitive damages:  5.</PRE>
