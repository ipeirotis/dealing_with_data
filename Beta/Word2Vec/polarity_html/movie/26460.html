<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A reticent small town Pennsylvannia private detective John Klute (Donald
Sutherland) is hired to track down an engineer researcher who never
returned from New York City six months ago. Klute is a friend of the
victim's family and is hired by the research firm's top executive Peter
Cable (Cioffi), after the FBI failed to come up with anything concrete.
It's the family's hope that since Klute was a friend of Tom Gruneman
(Milli), he will doggedly search for him, which will overcome his lack
of investigating experience. There are disturbing pornographic letters
that suddenly materialize, ones that Tom wrote to a high class NYC
call-girl Bree Daniels (Jane Fonda), which mention how he likes to get
beaten.</P>
<P>The FBI tells Klute that Bree can't remember the john, but remembers
getting beaten two years ago by one of her customers. The FBI closed her
business down as a result of the investigation and after spending a
brief stay in jail, she is trying to land either a modeling or acting
job, while doing tricks on a part-time basis. She is also seeing a
psychiatrist so she can understand why she has a need to be a call-girl.</P>
<P>She reluctantly agrees to help Klute after receiving heavy breathing
calls and sensing that someone is following her. Their relationship
becomes the heart of the film, rather than the mystery story. The film's
main asset is that it is played as a psychological character study of
the Jane Fonda character, who becomes a prostitute because she can
control men and is good at it. Sutherland, in an understated
performance, is revealed as someone who becomes overprotective of her,
even to the point of it being an obsession, going beyond his call of
duty to get to the bottom of the case. Their love affair which emerges
unexpectantly, is unsettling to both of them, but real feelings develop
on both sides, to the surprise of each, and how they resolve it, is what
gives this film its bit of magic.</P>
<P>The mystery part was solved early on in the film, as we see Cable
listening to a tape of Bree he secretly recorded, where she states her
view that nothing one does is wrong, let it all hang out. The suspense
comes as we learn what happened to Tom and how and why he was framed by
Cable. It now becomes a matter of proving he did it and seeing if Klute
can protect Jane from him.</P>
<P>The film takes us into Bree's world of pimps, high-rollers, prostitutes,
and drug-addicts, a world Klute thinks is pathetic. She is an
intelligent woman, whose outer persona is one of a confidant woman, but
inside she is a scared girl, afraid of the dark and of being alone. She
has just broken up with her pimp husband Frank and has gotten away from
the other girls working for him, the one who committed suicide and was
the girl who actually set her up with the man posing as Tom, and with a
junkie Arlyn, who might know who is still after her. These scenes were
too predictable and offered no real insight into that underground world
of prostitution, leaving many dry spells in the thin story line. The
three murders Cable commits were all done off camera, so he is never
viewed as a violent man, but he becomes a source of analysis when he
confesses to Bree why he did what he did.</P>
<P>Jane Fonda did get into the head of an intelligent call-girl who is
searching for answers to her life, enough so she won a Best Actress
Oscar for her performance, though I thought she was at times shrill and
played the role with too much of a calculated effort. I actually
preferred Donald Sutherland's contrasting role, even though the film
wasn't about him, I thought his normalcy was harder to convey than her
hipster role. It was a film about conflicts over emotional involvement
and independence, whereas I thought Fonda could recover more easily from
this tragic part of her life than Sutherland could.</P>
<P>Klute was fresh when it came out in the 1970s, but time has taken away
much of its boldness. Even the semi-nude scenes are very tame by today's
standards. What remains enticing, is the ambiguity of the couple's fate
as lovers after the crisis is resolved, as each of them has made it
clear, they belong in the world they staked out for themselves, no
matter how emotionally they may need each other: Sutherland as a hick,
Fonda as a city-slicker.</P>
