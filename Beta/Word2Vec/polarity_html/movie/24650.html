<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This film was adapted from a Lucille Fletcher 22-minute radio drama,
where Agnes  Moorehead played the invalid heiress Leona Stevenson. This
popular radio program was rebroadcast seven times between 1943 and 1948,
starring Moorehead in a role that she had made famous. Hallis Wallis,
the Paramount studio boss, wanted a big name for the role when his
company bought the rights to make this thin script into a movie, so he
chose Barbara Stanwyck over Moorehead, which became a movie role she
would become famous for and one in which she received an Oscar
nomination for Best Actress.</P>
<P>The film opens as Leona Stevenson is seen confined to her bed in her
summer home in New York with the telephone being her only means of
communication with the outside world. She accidentally overhears a
telephone conversation about a murder of a woman that is to take place
that night at 11:15, as the telephone wires get crossed when she is
making a call to her husband's office. She is panicky that her husband
Henry (Burt Lancaster) has left her alone without telling her and she is
desperately trying to call his office, but the line is continually busy.
So she asks the telephone operator to help and tries to convey to her
the dreaded conversation she has just overheard, but the operator tells
her to call the police, that the call can't be traced. The police only
inform her that the information that she gave them is too vague for them
to do anything about it. At the moment, she doesn't tell the police that
she is afraid for herself because she doesn't suspect that she is the
target of the murder.</P>
<P>The film plays on one's fears of being alone and of being physically
handicapped. Every sound becomes a dangerous one and familiar sights
seem to now hold new dangers in them, as Leona is in the midst of a
severe anxiety attack. Her father (Ed Begley) calls her regularly from
their permanent home in Chicago, where he owns a big drug company and
where she lives permanently in the same mansion there with her husband.
He tells her that Henry should be home and that he has no company
business, and that he'll speak to him tomorrow about just that.</P>
<P>She soon receives a telephone message wired by her husband that he is
away on business for the weekend and won't be able to see her until
Sunday morning.</P>
<P>The film uses the method of flashback to enlarge the story. Anxious to
find out where her husband is, she reaches his secretary at home, who is
only too glad to tell her that her husband made a luncheon date with an
attractive woman named Sally Lord Dodge (Ann Richards). This brings back
memories of how she met her husband eight years ago at a public dance,
where she boldly stole him away from Sally. She had always been a
self-indulgent person, who demands to get what she wants. She wanted
Henry, even though he was from the wrong side of the tracks, a high
school drop-out, and working as a clerk in a drug store. After she
married him, her father took him into the business and made him a vice
president in the firm, and he settled into a life of luxury, but paid
the price for it by becoming a henpecked husband who had to cater to all
her whims or else she would suffer heart attacks or throw a temper
tantrum.</P>
<P>She learns from a phone conversation with her doctor (Wendell Corey),
that he told her husband a few weeks ago that she was as sound as a
bell, that her problems are mental: she is a cardiac neurotic and
doesn't need medical help but psychiatric. He is surprised she doesn't
know this because her husband has a letter from him and promised that he
would discuss this with you before you started your treatments.</P>
<P>In her phone conversation with Sally, she learns that Sally's husband is
an investigator in the district attorney's office in New York and that
she only had lunch with Henry to warn him that he is being investigated
by the office, but she doesn't know much more than that.</P>
<P>Stanwyck's world seems to be breaking down right in front of her, as a
scarier call follows from a person who identifies himself as a chemist
in her father's company, named Mr. Evans (Vermilyea). He tells of her
husband's plans to cheat the company by stealing one of their drug
products and selling it through a fence named Morano (Conrad). Evans
tells her that Morano has been arrested. He also tells of how Morano
bribed her husband and forced him into following his plan to have her
killed for her insurance money, money that Morano says the ambitious
Henry owes him for trying to weasel out of their deal.</P>
<P>It takes Leona a long time to realize that she is the one targeted to be
killed. The film sustains the suspense until the very end, as it now
becomes a question if she will survive the attack and how will Henry
react as he calls her at 11:12 P.M. and hears from her that Morano has
been arrested.</P>
<P>The film is well executed, mainly through the efforts of the director
and the star of the film. The expressionistic direction of the European
emigre director, Anton Litvak, who shoots her bedroom as if it were a
luxury prison, thereby capturing the claustrophobic mood of the story,
and, in the finely tuned hysterical performance by Stanwyck, capturing
how she changes from an arrogant woman who expects to get everything she
wants to a helpless woman shrieking out in terror. Even as an
intolerable woman, casting herself in self-imprisonment, she engineers
our sympathy for her current plight, as we see that she desperately
needs psychological treatment more than anything else.</P>
