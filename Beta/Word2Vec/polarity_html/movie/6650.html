<PRE>                        JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE (also called POLICE STORY 4: FIRST
STRIKE) is the Hong Kong action star's latest film.  Unlike his past
low budget films, this one has a highly polished look and appears to
have a cost quite a bit more.  For you many Jackie Chan fans, do not
worry, his latest picture is as much fun as the others.  On the other
hand, if you hated him before, this film is unlikely to change your
mind.  The acting by the supporting cast is pathetic, but, hey, you've
got Jackie.  With his everyman demeanor, his innocent smile, and his
vulnerability, he easily wins over the hearts of most audiences.</P>
<P>     The plot, such as it is, concerns a stolen Ukrainian nuclear
warhead.  The action happens all over the world from the Ukraine to
Australia.  The plot is a mess.  Do not waste your time trying to make
any sense out of it.  Just sink back into your theater seat and wait
for Jackie's next great stunt, remembering that Jackie does all his own
stunts.  Just to make sure you are aware of this, the film ends with
five minutes of outtakes of him attempting the stunts.  Usually
outtakes are shown along with the credits, but this time they hold the
credits until the outtakes are finished.  One could argue that this
means they are really not outtakes, but who cares.  They are
entertaining, and entertainment is the only motivation for catching a
Jackie Chan film in the first place.  They are not high art.</P>
<P>     The camera loves Jackie.  His smiles are genuine, and his action
sequences are gorgeous set pieces.  Never expected to be realistic, his
demonstrations of physical abilities are meant to dazzle.  The press
materials claim that in this film, "Chan takes his daredevilry to a new
level." I'm not sure about a new level, but the film is certainly more
visually attractive than his last, RUMBLE IN THE BRONX.</P>
<P>     I will not even attempt to outline the plot of FIRST STRIKE since,
as I said already, it is inconsequential.  The action is the show so I
will cover some of it instead.</P>
<P>     The temperature in the film varies widely.  Jackie freezes in the
snow, basks in the coastal sun, and swims underwater.</P>
<P>     The snow scenes are the best.  Dressed in a thin shirt with only a
kid's silly seal pup cap on for warmth, Jackie uses a snowmobile to
chase the bad guy.  He raises his shirt to show us how cold he is.  He
is an actor who is easy to empathize with so when he freezes, you
freeze.  He is hurt and frightened more often than any other action
hero, and here he is forced to spend time swimming in water partially
covered with ice.</P>
<P>     In the best visual in the film, enemy soldiers are hidden in the
snow, unbeknownst to Jackie.  When they start popping up and shooting
their Uzis, their uniforms are sure to garner chuckles from the
viewers.  They wear Ku Klux Klan style robes with white Halloween
skeleton masks.  Much of Jackie's films are played for broad humor, and
the audience is not supposed to take them seriously.  They are pure
James Bond material.</P>
<P>     Jackie also gets to swim underwater and practice his karate moves
on a host of evil characters.  The zinger is that there are man-eating
sharks swimming around to lunch on the fighters.</P>
<P>     I have two small favorites in the film.  First, Jackie stays in an
8,000 square foot hotel room in Australia, and it comes with its own
live koala.  He is really cute.  Actually, if you think about it, he
resembles Jackie.  Their smiles are so similar.</P>
<P>     Second, how do you stop a sharpshooter on a rooftop?  Call forth
an instant array of parasols.  He can't shoot what he can't see.</P>
<P>     And there is so much more.  I didn't even mention the attack of
the killer sea urchins.</P>
<P>     JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST STRIKE runs about an hour and a half.  The
actors speak many languages, but non-English speaking ones, like
Jackie, are dubbed reasonably effectively into English.  The film is
rated PG-13 for cartoonish violence.  There is no sex, nudity, or bad
language.  The picture would be fine for kids say ten and up.  I had
fun so I am giving the show a mild thumbs up and ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
