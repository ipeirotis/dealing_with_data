<P>     If you thought the criminals in BOTTLE ROCKET and FARGO were 
incompetent, wait until you meet the trio from PALOOKAVILLE...  They 
can't seem to get anything right.  Nevertheless, what separates this 
film from the many other crime-gone-wrong pictures is that it's almost 
completely non-violent.  There are no shoot outs, fistfights, or 
explosions.  There is a gun, but it's used primarily as a prop.</P>
<P>     PALOOKAVILLE (the title is from the classic Marlon Brando line in 
ON THE WATERFRONT about losers) is the debut feature for director Alan 
Taylor, who has used the stories of post-WWII Italian author Italo 
Calvino and the 1956 comic heist movie, BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET, as 
inspirations.  This film, which takes place in Jersey City, New Jersey, 
chronicles the failed robbery attempts of three inept protagonists:  Sid 
(William Forsythe), Russell (Vincent Gallo), and Jerry (Adam Trese).  
The problem is, while these "self-unemployed" men need money to pay the 
rent, none has the kind of personality necessary for a life of crime.  
As Jerry says, "We're not really cut out for this.  Some people are.  
For instance, criminals."</P>
<P>     PALOOKAVILLE opens with a jewelry store robbery gone bad -- but not 
in RESERVOIR DOGS fashion.  Here, it's a bloodless, customerless night 
operation, with Russ and Jerry knocking a hole in the back brick wall 
while Sid stands guard out front.  The problem is, they've got the wrong 
store -- it's a bakery adjacent to the jewelers, and the booty ends up 
being jelly donuts and pastries instead of diamonds and gold.</P>
<P>     Following this first failed caper, the gang tries to go straight, 
but their good intentions don't last long.  Eventually, they hatch a 
plot to rob an armored car.  It's not a very good plan -- parts are 
culled from the old RKO movie, ARMORED CAR ROBBERY -- but they seem to 
think it's foolproof.  Inevitably, however, when it comes to pulling the 
heist, Murphy's Law is in full force, and nothing goes the way anyone 
expected.</P>
<P>     One of the things that elevates PALOOKAVILLE over the likes of 
BOTTLE ROCKET and THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD is its 
character development.  Although this film is sprinkled with comic 
moments and its tone is basically lighthearted, it treats its 
protagonists seriously.  Sid, Russ, and Jerry seem like real people -- 
losers with good hearts who want to commit crimes but lack the requisite 
toughness and cynicism.  Through their relationships with women and 
their illegal activities, each of PALOOKAVILLE's main characters learns 
something about himself and the world.</P>
<P>     The lead actors -- William Forsythe (THINGS TO DO IN DENVER), 
Vincent Gallo (THE PEREZ FAMILY), and Adam Trese (THE UNDERNEATH) -- are 
effective in their roles, and they're given solid support by Frances 
McDormand (as a local prostitute), Gareth Williams (as Russ' policeman 
brother-in-law), and Bridgit Ryan (as a young woman who falls for Sid).  
The best performance is turned in by Forsythe, playing against type as a 
shy man who acts like he lost his wife to death, not divorce.  Gallo's 
Russ would like us to believe that he's a tough hood, but his hard 
personality is really a front.  And Jerry just wants an alternative 
source of income so his wife doesn't have to work for the sleazy store 
manager who gropes her.</P>
<P>     With an evocative score by Rachel Portman and cinematography by 
John Thomas, PALOOKAVILLE has a feel that belies its $1 million budget.  
At times, the movie is funny, touching, and quirky.  There are a few 
isolated scenes that don't work, but, in general, PALOOKAVILLE 
represents insouciant entertainment bolstered by an unforced message 
about not taking the "American dream" too seriously.  After all, the 
people in PALOOKAVILLE may be losers with little hope of rising above 
their circumstances, but that doesn't mean they don't have hearts and 
souls.</P>
<P>     After winning the Kodak award for Best First Feature at the 1995 
Venice Film Festival, PALOOKAVILLE has become a festival favorite.  
Although it's not due to be released until September of 1996 (and then 
only in a limited run), it will be shown at dozens of festivals during 
the spring, including those in Cleveland, San Francisco, Dallas, and 
Philadelphia.  And, although it may appear Tarantino-inspired at a 
glance, once you get into PALOOKAVILLE, you'll understand that it has a 
much kinder, gentler story to tell.</P>
