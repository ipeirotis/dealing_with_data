Reviewed January 10, 1999.</P>
<P>Since director Steven Zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay 
for 1993's Steven Spielberg drama "Schindler's List" and directed 1993's 
intelligent "Searching for Bobby Fischer," his new film, "A Civil 
Action," should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in 
an otherwise prosperous career. What doesn't make sense is how such 
high-profile and superb actors as John Travolta, Robert Duvall, William 
H. Macy, and Kathleen Quinlan got involved in this project, which is 
both dull and completely ineffective. The film, which involves a small 
community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia, certainly 
contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged, but somehow all 
signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings, 
leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama.</P>
<P>Based on a book by Jonathan Hart, which was consequently based on a true 
account, "A Civil Action" is set in 1982 in the town of Woburn, Mass., 
where personal injury lawyer Jan Schlictmann (John Travolta) decides to 
take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their 
children's death from leukemia due to unknown causes. Jan originally 
decides to drop the case, but when he stumbles across to corporate 
giants, Grace and Beatrice Foods, who have plants located near the 
families' homes, he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place: the 
two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake 
which, thus, goes into the city's drinking water. Suddenly, after 
hearing about the families' heartbreak and personal stories, he begins 
to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the 
mystery, even though he is warned by his staff accountant (William H. 
Macy) that no money is coming in to them, only going out. Also figuring 
into the story is Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall), Beatrice Foods' 
corporate counsel, who finds himself in heated waters when Jan will not 
accept his $20-million offer to settle the case.</P>
<P>Coming from such a talented writer, director, and cast, not to mention 
one of the most interesting film composers, Danny Elfman, "A Civil 
Action" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama, one that includes an 
intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome 
and occasionally even boring experience. Perhaps one of its major 
problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion 
picture, Zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude 
with an absence of magnetism and even meaning.</P>
<P>Watching the film, I couldn't help but notice its similarities with 
1997's far, far superior film "The Sweet Hereafter," which dealt with a 
lawyer, played brilliantly by Ian Holm, investigating a school bus 
accident that killed a number of children. In his attempts to find 
someone who may have been responsible for the accident, Holm interviews 
the grieving parents, as well as the sole surviving passenger, a teenage 
girl, which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter, a young 
drug-addict who has run away from home. Not only was the plotting 
similar to "A Civil Action," but it also had the same exact running time 
of 115 minutes. Considering this, it is amazing how fulfilling and 
truthful "A Sweet Hereafter" was, not only concentrating on the school 
bus accident, but delving deeply into Ian Holm's character and his own 
personal demons, as well as the teenage girl. In "A Civil Action," 
however, I have no idea where the running time went, since the film is 
virtually two hours of nothingness. We do not get to know the parents 
very well, nor any of the main characters. Through its whole duration, I 
did not learn one thing__not one thing__about Travolta's lawyer 
character, Jan Schlictmann, who doesn't appear to have any sort of life 
or purpose outside of his job. Every scene is tediously related directly 
to the premise, and therefore, there was no one for me to care about or 
root for. You've got to work pretty hard, actually, to not get an 
audience to become involved in the parents' plight, since their children 
are dead, but that is exactly what "A Civil Action" does.</P>
<P>To be honest, I would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the 
film that I actually liked. Aside from one flashback to when a man's 
young son died on the way to the doctor, I remained unmoved and passive 
about what was going on in the scenes, and more than once found my mind 
wandering. I could say the performances were good, but who's fooling 
who? Since every character is one-dimensionally written, no one's acting 
abilities are challenged in any way. Travolta plays a lawyer well 
enough, but that's about all he does. Duvall virtually sleepwalks 
through his role, apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every 
chance he gets. And what in the world is Kathy Bates doing in the 
picture's final scene, as a judge? She appears unbilled, since it is 
just a cameo, but why did she even agree to do it in the first place? </P>
<P>Finally, when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role, 
the film left me with another question: what was the point? Abruptly 
ending without any susceptible momentum, where none came before that to 
begin with, "A Civil Action" seemed to me, at least, to be an example of 
how not to make a courtroom drama, and it certainly did not do justice 
to the very serious subject matter the film deals with. </P>
