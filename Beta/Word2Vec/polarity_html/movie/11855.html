                                          SPAWN
                           A Film Review By Fernando Vallejo
  _____________________________________________________</PRE>
<PRE>   RATING (OUT OF ****): *</PRE>
<P>  While the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation,  we had
yet another shoddy, subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought
on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with
everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks. And,
once again, we have one of the worst films of the year.</P>
<P> The trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is
SPAWN, and if you've seen the animated series on HBO you'll recall it embodies
the lost life of a disfigured man, an individual who has transpired the
ultimate punishment: He's been sent to hell. Todd McFarlane, the creator of
the SPAWN comic book, must have had a tough time sitting through SPAWN, for
his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all
being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects, style over substance,
ambience over anything else. </P>
<P> Not only does SPAWN rely entirely on special effects, the story, about a
bewildered individual who must take on a group of *bad guys* and *find
himself* in the process is realized in such a sordid, incapable manner, it
becomes indigestible after a while. Every character in this film is lifeless,
vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student. </P>
<P> The story begins, like in every superhero movie in this age, with a man
living an idyllic life. Al Simmons (Michael Jai White), a government
agent/assassin shares the love of his wife, Wanda (Theresa Russell ) and
daughter, has a tongue-in-cheek, wiseass partner, Terry (D.B Sweeney) and is
content with the job his boss, Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), provides him.</P>
<P>The next element in the film is the part when things go awry. And as expected,
everyone turns the tables on poor Al. </P>
<P> As the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological
weapons plant, Al is befriended by Jason, and dies in a gory and truly
sickening scene. Inevitably, it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has
passed away. Hence, Jason's mischievous master-mind plan, to ` conquer the
world" is just commencing its initial stages, when Al makes a pact with Satan
himself, agreeing to command the Devil's army to take over the world and he
gets to see his family again.</P>
<P> So, our pal Al has been uplifted to hell, and while his transformation from
normal guy to Spawn takes place, his ol' partner Terry forms a relationship
with his wife. Time passes. And now Spawn is present in the grotesque inner
city, the ghetto where Cog (Nicol Williamson ) teaches Spawn how to utilize
his neat artifacts, his motorbike, armor, etc... This character is merely a
poor man's Obi Wan Kenobi without all the mythological hoopla. </P>
<P> Now the stage is set Spawn, the new `enemy of evil' Vs Evil. And evil takes
the cake, doubtlessly. John Leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the
injurious clown working for Wynn is the film's relief point. All this anguish,
pain, half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to Leguizamo,
who steals the show and derives joy from his character, which is basically a
compilation of so-so one liners. </P>
<P> And then there's Martin Sheen. Whichever way you look you will find carving
boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years. His selections
calls for an immediate firing of his agent. As the megalomaniac boss, his
caricature plays like a bad dream out of a B-movie, scrambled, and left in the
shelf to rot. This is the man that starred in films such as APOCALYPSE NOW and
WALL STREET. I'd never thought I'd be saying this, but at this juncture,
Charlie Sheen's career is in better shape.</P>
<P> SPAWN is a movie in which realism, or even an attempt to draw a parallel
between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable. For most of
the film the vapid Michael Jai White consumes his time ogling, jumping through
roofs, and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even BATMAN AND
ROBIN accomplished better. It constantly reminded us we were watching a
superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie. Continually the film kept on
depending on special effects, and sadly, this is how pictures are being made.
Perhaps no other movie better than SPAWN illustrates the deterioration of
cinema through computer wizardry. The filmmakers seem to have forgotten every
human element possible. The quality of this film is abysmal and insulting.</P>
<P> It is perceptible that director Mark Dippe, attempted to touch the
psychological chord that Tim Burton's BATMAN DID touch, the desperation of a
man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act. But Bruce Wayne
had human elements to him. He was pensive, resourceful and had relationships,
which made our perspective on him equally human. The character of Al Simmons
seems to be LONGING for a drastic change, as if he's fatigued about being
normal. And as all superheroes, Batman, Superman, The Phantom, they must
possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are
extraordinary. None of this is present
in  SPAWN.</P>
<P> The fighting sequences are weakly executed, the dialogue is penny-dreadful
and the art direction an odious duplicate of BLADE RUNNER'S. As an example of
this film's vastly creative imagination the writers of SPAWN decided to
include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten, and then rescued by
Spawn, so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic. Admittedly, I did
laugh once in the film ,and that's when Todd McFarlane showed up in an
unexpected cameo as a bum. </P>
<P> It is no wonder why so American children grow up with no engrossment for art
or literature. Besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school
system, I condemn the other part to garbage like SPAWN. Movies that present no
admiration, no captivation, no richness and vague interest in what children
are being subjected to. And kids will continue to see films like SPAWN, simply
because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative, wondrous
film from an insipid and wasteful one. Children are not muppets. And SPAWN
unapologetically targets children. </P>
