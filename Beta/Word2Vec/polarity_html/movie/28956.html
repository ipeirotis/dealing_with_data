<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>An invigorating Charlie Chan escapade and the best one in the series, featuring
Sidney Toler as Chan. Charlie Chan and number two son, Jimmy Chan (Yung), are
flying from Hawaii to San Francisco with their mystery writer friend Paul Essex
(Heydt), who has just been a guest of Charlie's. When he completes the last page
of his new book on the plane, he's found dead. He had just received a
threatening radiogram stating "You Can't Escape the Zodiac." On the plane is the
nosy Mr. Gregory (Dumbrille), who claims to be an insurance agent. But he
becomes a suspect when he pilfers Paul's manuscript and then vanishes. </P>
<P>The police at first rule the Essex death as a heart attack or a possible
suicide, but change their mind when they find poison in his stomach and now
investigate it as a possible homicide. Charlie tells Paul's wife Stella (Sally
Blane--the wife of the director and Loretta Young's sister) the bad news as she
came to greet him at the airport with her uncle Redley, who is also her
husband's business agent. </P>
<P>Through Charlie's acquaintance with S.F. Deputy Police Chief Kilvaine, he's
introduced to a police reporter Peter Lewis (Fowley) who is writing a series of
exposes on the fake Dr. Zodiac. In the past month there have been three suicides
linked to Zodiac, who might have been blackmailing them. </P>
<P>Peter takes Charlie to meet the magician Rhadini (Romero), at his Treasure
Island headquarters, and he hears him call his colleague and main competitor
Zodiac a fraud and aims to prove that he's a fake. The others in Rhadini's
entourage are: Eve Cairo (Moore), a mind reader who is the girlfriend of Peter
Lewis. Peter is upset because Zodiac is telling Eve to break off with him. She
also believes that Zodiac is not a fraud, and Eve's ESP powers are
scientifically tested as genuine. Mrs. Rhadini (Gale), who was formerly a
carnival knife-thrower and is now glum because she suspects hubby of being a
womanizer. There's also Bessie Sibley (Seward), who introduced Eve to Dr. Zodiac
and is a victim of the blackmailer. </P>
<P>Charlie sneaks off alone to visit Dr. Zodiac at his research center, but Rhadini
and Lewis meet him in front of the Zodiac's building. They are greeted at the
door by The Turk, who is Zodiac's servant. Once inside Charlie is allowed to
question the Zodiac. From this demo, Charlie believes he knows who the killer is
and has all the suspects come to the theater. </P>
<P>The film reaches its climax after several plot twists when there's a challenge
between Rhadini and Zodiac, which Charlie asks Lewis's paper to sponsor. As
Rhadini puts on his show before a live audience, the Zodiac is killed with a
poisoned arrow as it was written in Paul's book. But the Zodiac turns out to be
only The Turk disguised as him. Charlie notes that the Zodiac is a ventriloquist
and an egotist; that the Zodiac is also a blackmailer and a murderer, and is
present in the theater. Charlie will cunningly figure out who he is by
brilliantly deducing all the clues. This wasn't a tough one to figure out who
did it, but the story was a seamless one. It was a fun film, and one also got a
chance to see the San Francisco version of the 1939 World's Fair. </P>
