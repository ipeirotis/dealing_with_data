<PRE>Review by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>I should have been so lucky to have been gone from the theater in 60
seconds; but, I sat through this two hour remake of the slender film
"Gone" (1974), an original film that was so shallow, everything else
seen that year must have seemed deep by comparison. It's hard to get
lower in moral decrepitude than this car current booster film. This was
not only a bad film but a particularly annoying one. This is a Jerry
Bruckheimer productions, which has come to stand for mediocrity in
artistic value but for success in the box office, which will probably
mirror how this film does, though it is a little worst artistically
speaking than his other mediocre films, as if that will supposedly
matter to its target audience.</P>
<P>To make up for not coming prepared with a script that made sense, a
stellar cast was hired but then was asked to do nothing, instead some
gorgeous vintage cars were put on display and each was given a girl's
name. Everything about the story was kept hyper, as mindless violence
won out over gratuitous sex, to become the major selling point of this
exploitive film. Though, the real star of the film, is that climactic
car chase at the final scene, with Cage outracing the police in his
stolen 1967 Shelby GT Mustang, speeding through the downtown streets and
freeway in Los Angeles.</P>
<P>The action begins right from the opening credits. A Porsche is stolen
out of a car showroom in Southern California and the police follow the
speeding car right to its point of destination, a garage, where there
are a number of other high-end cars stolen, waiting to be shipped to its
new illegitimate owner in a matter of days. Nicolas Cage stars as
Randall "Memphis" Raines, once the best "booster" in the world, but now
retired. What brings him back into the car theft business, is that his
arrogant younger brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) fouls up the delivery
dates for the cars, as the cops impound all the cars they find at the
garage he led them to. The malicious crime boss Raymond Calitri
(Christopher Eccleston) tells Memphis, in order to save Kip's ass from
being expunged from the human race, he must steal the specific list he
gives him of 50 high-scaled rare cars Ray promised his client he was to
deliver to him in four days. It is incredulous that Memphis falls for
such an offer from such an untrustworthy mobster, especially since there
were so many other options for him to take that were less risky, and not
the least of the options, would be going to a lawyer and copping a plea
bargain deal for his brother with the district attorney.</P>
<P>But Cage accepts this ludicrous challenge to save his brother by
stealing these cars and returns home to Long Beach to tell his
long-suffering mother, that he has to renege on his promise to her to
never go back to stealing cars, because this is the only way he can save
Kip. He then goes to his old pal Robert Duvall, who runs a vintage body
shop. Duvall was once part of Cage's car ring, and he helps Cage put
together the crew he needs to pull off the heist.</P>
<P>Cage also must avoid a detective (Delroy Lindo) who knows he has
something to do with those cars stolen through his informants and puts
him under surveillance. The thrill of the film now becomes in watching
the crew be selected, which includes Angelina Jolie, Chi McBride, James
Duval, and Scott Caan, none of whom are in the least bit interesting or
funny. Jolie seems to disappear for most of the film, only to reappear
much later in the film and mumble a few inconsequential lines. The
enlisted crew give their reason for not joining Cage's caper, saying
they are clean now or some jump head-first into this project, but
whatever, they all join in this stupid venture. No one seems to be
concerned that they are doing something that is criminal.</P>
<P>There's also a car thief rival of Cage's, played by Master P, I think
he's a rapper when he's not in high-class films like this one. He gets
into a feud with Cage, believing that Cage got the contract from Ray
that was meant for him.</P>
<P>There's basically no story or dialogue, the action is all packaged like
commercials are with
gloss and trick shots, colored filters, fast-paced editing, and all the
other tricks of the trade the directors for Jerry Bruckheimer use to
sell the action sequences. Everything about this film seemed ridiculous.
Its logic for being could be taken apart at any point of the film. But
the ending, after the car chase, was what finally got my craw. The moral
bankruptcy it presented, that Lindo would just let Cage and his crew off
the hook for all the thefts, was too much to comprehend. It was so weak
to hear Lindo say to Cage, "Well, you saved my life, and I guess it was
a brotherly thing you did for your brother, so I'm going to let you go,
now get out of here before I change my mind." If I had my wish, Lindo
should go to jail for failing to do his job. The director should go to
work in Duvall's body shop and never direct another film. And, this
senseless macho film should die a slow death at the box office, so films
like this would become extinct like dinosaurs. I should be so lucky... .</P>
