<P>     When an independent film-maker gets his first studio deal, the fans
of his or her previous work often worry what will happen when he or she
"goes Hollywood."  There are sound historical reasons for such concern
(think of Lee Tamahori's MULHOLLAND FALLS or Antonia Bird's MAD LOVE, if
you are one of the few people who actually saw them), but in the case of
Edward Burns, such concern would seem to be misplaced.  For an independent
feature, THE BROTHERS McMULLEN was about as mainstream as they come, a
low-key charmer unlikely to offend anyone who wasn't a devout Catholic
with a short fuse.  With a budget about 120 times greater than McMULLEN,
Burns has made SHE'S THE ONE, a film just as unlikely to offend...and,
unfortunately, equally unlikely to entertain.</P>
<P>     Burns and Mike McGlone, who were two-thirds of THE BROTHERS McMULLEN,
again play siblings in SHE'S THE ONE.  Mickey Fitzpatrick (Burns) is an
under-motivated cab driver; his younger brother Francis (McGlone) is an
over-motivated stock broker.  What they have in common are significant
problems with women:  Mickey has never quite gotten over catching his
then-fiancee with another man three years earlier, and Francis is cheating
on his wife Renee (Jennifer Aniston) with Heather (Cameron Diaz), a
business colleague.  When Mickey marries a woman named Hope (Maxine Bahns)
after a whirlwind 24 hour courtship, at least one of the brothers appears
headed for happiness...until he learns what his ex-fiancee has been up to
since they parted.</P>
<P>     If there was any real criticism leveled at THE BROTHERS McMULLEN, it
was that it was simply a testosterone-enhanced version of a female bonding
film, in which the female characters existed primarily to give the men
something to complain about while sharing a beer.  At times, SHE'S THE ONE
feels like Burns' sheepish apology for that aspect of McMULLEN, a piece of
sensitive self-flagellation.  "Look how we men make everything in our
lives -- our jobs, our hobbies, our fantasies -- more important than our
wives," he says sub-textually.  "Don't we deserve whatever we get?"</P>
<P>     It's a nice gesture, this throwing open of the doors to the Boys Only
Club, but Burns doesn't support it with characters who ring true, male or
female.  Burns himself has a pleasant, likeable quality, but we are never
given any insight into why he would be impetuous enough to marry a
near-complete stranger.  His dramatic range appears limited to mild
annoyance and affability, and Burns the actor can't bring to the screen
whatever hidden passions Burns the writer might have put on paper.  Still,
that's at least twice the range of Maxine Bahns (Burns' real-life
girlfriend who also played his love interest in McMULLEN yet for some
reason is billed "Introducing Maxine Bahns" in ads for SHE'S THE ONE).
Let me make this point as subtly as I can:  Bahns did not get this part
because she had a particularly good audition; she reads a line as though
she were going through the script underlining it with her finger.  Mike
McGlone contributes a generic selfish, corporate go-getter, and John
Mahoney tones down his "Frasier" crankiness just a touch as the
Fitzpatricks' dad.</P>
<P>     Much of the pre-release interest, however, will be focused on the
other two main cast members.  Cameron Diaz, the latest Next Big Thing as
of 7:00 p.m. PDT, provides the same punch of smart sexuality she brought
to THE MASK, and works wonders with a part which could have been a
sneering bitch in other hands.  As for Jennifer Aniston, she of the hit
television series and ubiquitous coiffure, don't expect a leading role
just because she is receiving top billing in SHE'S THE ONE; it's
alphabetical.  Her part is actually relatively small, but she gets some of
the best and most poignant scenes.  She has an effective, almost silent
moment in which she slips into bed next to disinterested husband McGlone
in a sexy new negligee, only to have him ignore her completely.  While
Burns seems unwilling to break her of the habit of saying "okay" before
nearly every line, her work is still quite solid.</P>
<P>     There are moments like Aniston's failed seduction which have a spark
either of honesty or humor (a montage in which the cast members try to
decide whether Francis might be gay is cleverly done), but they prove more
the exception than the rule in SHE'S THE ONE.  It's all very casual and
under-stated, but it feels like an extended sit-com -- no character too
deep, no problem too complicated.  I guess you could say that Edward Burns
has indeed "gone Hollywood," in the most unfortunate sense of the term.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 brotherly lugs:  5.</PRE>
