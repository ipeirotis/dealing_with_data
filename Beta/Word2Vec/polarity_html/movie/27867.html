<P> AN AFFAIR OF LOVE (UNE LIAISON PORNOGRAPHIQUE) (director: Frederic
 Fonteyne; screenwriter: Philippe Blasband; cinematographer: Virginie
 Saint-Martin; editor: Chantal Hymans; cast: Nathalie Baye (Elle-Her),
 Sergi Lopez (Lui-Him), Jacques Viala (Interviewer); Runtime: 78; Fine
 Line Features; 2000)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a French romantic story about two strangers living out their
fantasy in a Paris hotel
on Thursdays for a period of six months. A sensuous woman, Nathalie
Baye, in her forties, meets a man online for a casual sex affair, so
that she can fulfill her sexual fantasy. Sergi Lopez, also someone who
is fortysomething, but according to his version, he responded to a
personal ad in a girlie magazine and sent a letter with his photo, which
resulted in the two meeting in a bar. In this minimalist tale, the two
are interviewed separately by an unseen Jacques Viala, who could never
get either one of them to reveal their fantasy, and what's more, they
sometimes had different impressions about the affair.</P>
<P>Interestingly, this is a very steamy story, but the sex is not
explicit...as the film is more than anything else a love story, about
two nameless souls, not knowing anything about each other's lives, but
through sex falling in love...yet unable in their six month relationship
to find a way to make a declaration of love that sticks.</P>
<P>The story is narrated by the two, through the interviewer's offscreen
questions to them about their relationship. Which starts with their
first date, as each is visibly nervous, but they proceed to the hotel
across the street and have their first sexual encounter behind closed
doors. All the viewer finds out about it, is that it went OK and they
will be meeting again next week. We also see that they are both
sensitive, intelligent and respectable people.</P>
<P>The only time we see them have sex, is when they decide to do it
"normally," with the only twist that she's on top of him. This normal
sex excites them more than the fantasy she advertised for does, and it
is also emotionally unwinding for them, as it brings them closer
together than they imagined this relationship would be able to do. It
was a great bedroom lovemaking scene, which was intimately done with
both humor and passion.</P>
<P>But the viewer, unable to know more than the little he sees about them,
can only guess at what draws them so close. The story played more like a
gimmick than a real love affair, because after their initial encounters,
it seemed rather strange that these intelligent people wouldn't be
curious to know more about each other, especially since they were
developing a certain bond together.</P>
<P>Yet, on the other hand, the reason this film worked so well, was the
illuminated performance by Baye, who was 50 at the time of the film, but
looks much younger and has such a touching quality about her, that she
is simply ravishing. There was a great chemistry between her and the
introspective, quietly handsome Spanish actor, Lopez. And if you add to
that the mature script by French novelist and playwright Philippe
Blasband and the classy way Frederic Fonteyne directed, it is easy to
see why the film was so enthralling. What you get is an affair that
turns out to be in surprisingly good taste, but without satisfying the
more mundane matters in a relationship. It was as if this was a sex lab
experiment, an ideal couple was being tested to see if a purely sexual
encounter could spark a more intimate relationship. If the film moved
off its experimental mode and let us see the couple act away from the
controlled ground rule conditions, this might have been an even much
better film.</P>
<P>The film was originally titled "Une Liaison Pornographique." It won for
Best Film at Venice.</P>
