<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>By the time this film was released, James Dean, the idolized 24-year-old
star of the film and soon-to-be eternal movie-cult icon for all
generations of estranged youth, had died in a head-on car collision on
September 30, 1955, shortly before this film was released.
Coincidentally, one of the themes of the film, is playing 'chickie run',
that is the cars race to a bluff and the first to jump before going over
the cliff, is a chicken. Everyone knows how bad it is to be called a
chicken--it could mess up one's self-image worst than the wind can mess
up a ducktail haircut for a teenager in the 1950s--as this
liberal-inspired social commentary film plunges right into that 1950s
Eisenhower era mind-set, without trepidation.</P>
<P>Nicholas Ray's teenage angst film about rich, postwar, suburban L.A.,
juvenile delinquents who are alienated and can't cope with their
disturbing home life, is arguably the best rebellious youth film of the
1950s and though dated, it still plays well today because the issues
facing the teenagers haven't changed that much. It was based on an
actual case study of a teenage delinquent. It's a film that
sympathetically sides with the rebellious youths and their befuddled
parents, and it doesn't even demonize the police. It airs out the
prevalent problems of the mid-'50s for these youngsters; such as,
loneliness, alienation, lack of love, fitting in with their peers, their
identity crises, and the lack of communication with their folks. It also
hints about a troubled youth, Plato, played with delicacy by Sal Mineo,
whose problem is that he is gay in a time and place where no one talked
about such things or knew what to say about it. Though, the film
stresses that his loneliness problem stems from no father at home and no
mother there to console him and tries to make his withdrawal the problem
rather than his homosexuality, yet there are strong hints that he is
still in-the-closet about his sexual choice. In his high school locker,
there is a glossy fan photo of Alan Ladd pasted on it. He also seems to
be attracted to Dean in a physical way, though the film tries to make it
seem that he mostly wants to induce Dean into being his surrogate
father.</P>
<P>The three main stars of the film, cross paths in the opening scene, in
the police station, which is just the right place for the mixed-up
innocents to meet. Jimmy Stark (Dean) is brought in for public
drunkeness, lying on the street with a toy monkey. He has just moved
here and has no friends. He is visibly upset that his crone-like mother
(Doran) and gutless father (Backus), who are always quarreling, are
still arguing in the police station. He feels that they are not
listening to him and that his bumbling father is not a good role model.
When questioned by the youth officer, Ray (Edward Platt), who uses the
kindly social worker approach in dealing with the young offenders, Jimmy
tells him the truth about his problems and seems to form a positive
relationship with him (I couldn't help laughing at that scene and how
punky Dean seemed). Judy (Wood) has been picked up wandering the
streets, mistaken for a prostitute, and tells Ray the reason for that,
is that her father (William Hopper) called her a dirty tramp. She can't
get her father to offer her fatherly love, as he seems to be repelled by
her. The officer calls home and gets her mother to take her home, when
she wanted her father to be the one to come for her.  The third
innocent, is John Crawford, who goes by the nickname Plato (you know,
like the philosopher). He is being looked after by his black nanny
(Canty), who can't control him. He is at the station because he used his
mother's gun to shoot puppies, seemingly upset because his mother was
not there for his birthday. Another officer than Ray, who had been
handling his case, recommends that his nanny tell his mother to get
Plato a psychiatrist.</P>
<P>The film takes place over one long 24-hour period of delirious activity,
starting on an Easter night in the police station and ending the next
night with police surrounding the planetarium, where the same three
principals from the opening scene at the police station are now at, but
are now in more serious trouble.</P>
<P>Jimmy is naturally nervous about going to his new school the next
morning, but he is not concerned about teachers or subjects, but about
making new friends. He is attracted to Judy, but she rebuffs him for the
crew she stays with, that is a gang of ruffians, led by her
leather-jacketed boyfriend Buzz (Corey Allen). All these well-off kids
ride to school together in this open car, acting loud and stupid, proud
to be dumb Americans. Supposedly, they will later on go on to become
what middle America is about, reflecting dearly on the values it grew up
with and pining for those "good old days" of Eisenhower laissez-faire
policies.</P>
<P>Jimmy's first contact with them is at the school visit to the nearby
D.W. Griffith Planetarium, and it results in taunting and confrontation
outside the building. He is dressed for school in a suit and tie, while
Plato is dressed in a sweater and tie. They are not looking for trouble,
in fact, he is trying his best to avoid it. But Jimmy is hung-up on
being called a chicken, afraid that he will become like his father if he
doesn't respond. He thinks his dad should have answered his harping
mother back a long time ago. So when egged on to a knife fight with
Buzz, after Buzz slashed his tire with his switchblade, which he would
have ignored except Buzz and the gang made chicken sounds. The fight is
broken up by a security guard, but a 'chickie run' is arranged for that
night.</P>
<P>At home, Jimmy tries to tell his father what is going on, why he is
bleeding, by asking his father to tell him what to do about a matter of
honor. Mr. Stark is ironically dressed in an apron and can't directly
answer his son's question: "What do you have to do to be a man?"</P>
<P>The rest of the night turns into a Shakespearian tragedy, as Jimmy bails
out in the nick of time during the 'chickie run', but Buzz's jacket gets
stuck in the car door and he goes over the cliff. Judy gets a ride home
with Jimmy and she becomes his new girlfriend, just like that. At home,
Jimmy tells his parents that he wants to go to the police station and
tell them what happened, but they try to talk him out of that. He then
runs out of the house but has no luck getting the police to listen to
his story, as Ray is not there. Crunch (Mazzola) and the rest of the
gang, who were called into the station for questioning, decide that he
has squealed to the police on them and go after him.</P>
<P>Jim finds Judy and they go to a deserted mansion that Plato told him
about, that is near the planetarium. Plato will join them there later,
bringing his mother's gun along for protection, after he was visited by
the gang and roughed up. They become like an alternative nuclear family,
the one they were searching for in their own homes.</P>
<P>They find some peace during the later hours of the night. But their
happiness is short-lived, as Crunch and the boys find them in the
mansion and Plato wounds Crunch who is coming after him. He then runs to
the planetarium to escape the rest of the gang. With the police
surrounding the planetarium, Jim and Judy run into the place to talk
Plato into peacefully giving up. But despite Jim's efforts, the
ill-fated Plato panics and is shot down by the police, as he tries to
run, frightened by the glare of the police lights. After the incident,
Jim's father reconciles with his son, telling him they will face the
world together from now on, that you tried to help Plato, but it's not
your fault, you did all that you could do, that any man can do. The
picture ends as the light of dawn is barely breaking through the
darkness and an unidentified man (Nicholas Ray) is walking up the steps
of the planetarium.</P>
<P>For all its aging and the changing mores of the times and the
ever-increasing complexities of modern youth, this creaky film still has
a rawness about it, something that is intangible, that gets into your
spine and brings out a chill or two, that tells you this dramatization
was real.</P>
