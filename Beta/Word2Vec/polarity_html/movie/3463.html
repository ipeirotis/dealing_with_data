<PRE>                                    PRIEST
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Linus Roache, Tom Wilkinson, Robert Carlyle, Cathy Tyson.
Screenplay:  Jimmy McGovern.
Director:  Antonia Bird.</P>
<P>     To tell you far more about myself than you ever really wanted
to know, I am what is known in the parlance as a lapsed Catholic.
Why would I make that information known?  It certainly wouldn't be
to promote the perception of objectivity in my evaluation of PRIEST;
one might believe that I was inclined to look favorably on a film so
roundly condemned by the Catholic Church sight unseen.  Such is not
the case.  I explain that I am a lapsed Catholic because the themes
in PRIEST are extremely familiar to me, and I believe that there is
a story in those themes which would make a fine film.  PRIEST could
have been a compelling character study which respected the
complexity of modern Catholicism, but instead it is, in its own way,
just as dogmatic as it accuses the Church of being.</P>
<P>     PRIEST stars Linus Roache as Father Greg Pilkington, a Catholic
priest newly assigned to a parish in working class Liverpool.  A
potential conflict arises when the very orthodox Father Greg learns
that another parish priest, Father Matthew (Tom Wilkinson), is not
only a free-thinking and free-speaking social liberal, but is also
cohabitating with their housekeeper Maria (Cathy Tyson).  However,
it soon becomes clear that Father Greg is living a double life of
his own, frequenting the city's gay nightclubs.  Father Greg
struggles to reconcile his homosexuality and his vocation, but an
even greater challenge to his faith comes when he is told in the
confessional by a young parishoner (Christine Tremarco) that she is
being sexually abused by her father--information a priest cannot
divulge.</P>
<P>     For much of the film, powerful acting and an intriguing
character keep PRIEST on the right track.  Roache, who resembles a
young Gabriel Byrne, is convincing as the devoted Catholic who
believes so strongly in the rules of his faith that he does nothing
to prevent the abuse he knows is taking place, and denies communion
to his lover Graham (an effectively subdued Robert Carlyle).  At the
same time, he finds himself unwilling or unable to deny his
sexuality, violating both the celibacy required of his order and the
Church's teachings on homosexuality.  It is the kind of selective
observation of Catholic dogma which is common among comtemporary
Catholics, and evidence of a skewed set of priorities.  Meanwhile,
Father Matthew has come to terms with what he believes are the
essentials of the faith, and lives a much happier life.  Director
Antonia Bird does a fine job of making iconography omnipresent;
crucifixes appear everywhere, most brilliantly in a shot where a
crucifix is placed between Father Greg and a reflection of himself,
a concise visual summation of the two parts of his personality
divided by the Church.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, what begins as a measured examination of
religious hypocrisies turns into a kind of tirade.  Screenwriter
Jimmy McGovern apparently doesn't trust the audience to get his
point from the events in Father Greg's life, so he turns the last
half hour of the film into a series of sermons, philosophical
discussions and exchanges of scripture passages.  Not only does the
film become pedantic at this point, it simply becomes dull, and
crawls toward its emotional climax.  The flawed but human characters
whose conflicts seem real become little more than mouthpieces.</P>
<P>     Perhaps it is most difficult to digest the message of PRIEST
because it makes so little effort to treat the opposing point of
view with any respect.  The only priests in the film who are not
alcoholics or having sex are scowling, hateful and cadaverous; there
is not a single character who supports orthodoxy who is treated as
anything but an ogre.  Whether or not the Catholic Church is
deserving of criticism is not even the point.  This is an
examination of doctrinal morality as Oliver Stone might have done
it, too full of homilies and too lacking in an understanding that
issues are usually shades of grey.  There are probably Father Gregs
and Father Matthews in many parishes around the world, and that is
an issue deserving of attention.  By sensationalizing Father Greg's
story, however, the makers of PRIEST end up preaching almost
exclusively to the converted.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 vows of celibacy:  5.</PRE>
