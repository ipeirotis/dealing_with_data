<PRE>                        2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY (1996)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Last year Robert Altman brought us his delightful SHORT CUTS.
That film is formed out of a set of seemly unrelated stories that find
their way together.</P>
<P>     Similarly in 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY, writer and director John
Herzfeld weaves us a tale of strange and apparently unrelated
characters.  Herzfeld's characters border on the bizarre, and yet each
is endearing.  The context that will bring them all together and
provide the hook for the audience is a murder.  The mystery is why was
the person killed.</P>
<P>     By midway you have learned the mystery's answer, but by then you
are wrapped up in the story and must know how all of the mini-dramas
that have burst forth will be resolved.  In short, the characters are
all compelling, and except for the one completely bad guy, you
empathize and care about them all.  As for the one pure villain, he is
carefully drawn and quite effective.</P>
<P>     As the movie starts, many parallel stories begin to blossom.  In
the first, two hit men, Lee (James Spader) and his partner Dosmo (Danny
Aiello), break into Roy Fox (Peter Horton) and his ex wife, Becky Fox's
(Teri Hatcher), bedroom in the middle of the night.  Lee is fond of
sticking his stop watch in front of people's eyes and giving them
exactly one minute to do whatever he tells them.  Roy flunks the one
minute pop quiz about Korean espionage and is terminated.  Becky has
been drugged into unconsciousness and thus is unable to help him with
the answers.</P>
<P>     At the same time vice cops Alex (Jeff Daniels) and his partner Wes
(Eric Stoltz) are trying to bust a massage parlor, but Wes develops too
soft a heart so the bust is a bust.  Alex wants to be a homicide
detective but has been stuck in the wrong jobs in the police department
for the last ten years.</P>
<P>     Lee goes back to his motel room where his girlfriend and
coconspirator Helga (Charlize Theron) are staying.  They engage in some
very impressive sex which again features his infamous stop watch.</P>
<P>     Across town art dealer Alan Hooper has a kidney stone attack in
the middle of the street.  When no one will come to his aid, he is
finally rescued by a car thief who is stealing a new car with the
license plate RIDEME.</P>
<P>     A despondent, highly unsuccessful, but extremely sweet writer and
director, Teddy (played by real life writer, director and actor Paul
Mazursky), is trying to find someone to take care of his little dog.
You see, Teddy has secret plans to commit suicide.  He is helped by
nurse Audrey (Marsha Mason) who says his dog can come to live at her
brother Alan's house since he is an art dealer and has lots of room.</P>
<P>     Dosmo ends up holding the art dealer and his secretary (Glenne
Headly) hostage.  Dosmo is a sensitive hit man, and Headly thinks she
recognizes him from somewhere.  At any rate, Dosmo fixes everyone some
pasta using his favorite recipe.</P>
<P>     Back at the crime scene, our vice cops get to help out until Doug
(Keith Carradine) comes along.  Doug is a real homicide cop so he sends
the amateurs away.</P>
<P>     This all happens in the first ten minutes or so.  The rest of the
picture has all of these characters revealing themselves and getting
more and more intertwined.</P>
<P>     The script is great.  The art dealer is a real pain.  He tells his
personal secretary that she needs liposuction and perhaps some silicon
implants, and he would be happy to pay for it.  This is not a come on,
he is just a fastidious type.  He has already paid to have her nose
fixed.  If you are rich enough, the moral seems to be that even your
middle-aged secretary should be flawless.</P>
<P>     When Doug finds a planted clue he tells his partner, "I know we're
Valley detectives so we're not all that bright, but how stupid does he
think we are?"</P>
<P>     Every character has a story to tell.  None are one dimensional.
We learn that Becky Fox is an Olympic skier with an obsessive training
program, but she has never finished higher than fourth place.</P>
<P>     The acting is excellent.  One of my favorite small scenes is at
the cemetery where Teddy is about to blow his brains out, but his cute
little dog just keeps looking at him with complete love and adoration.
The dog's innocence and ignorance is so poignant.</P>
<P>     This intricate story all comes together nicely.  The overall
mystery is not predictable nor are a lot of the minor dramas.  The
parts of the show that are predictable are still compelling.  Although
I thought the picture was weird when it began, I soon got into its
rhythms and loved it.  I got to know a fascinating group of people, and
what more should one ask of a movie.</P>
<P>     2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY runs about two hours.  It is rated R.  There
is sex, nudity, violence and bad language.  On an offensive scale, they
would all score pretty low, and I think the film would be fine for most
teenagers.  I recommend this quirky but rewarding little mystery and
character study to you, and I give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
