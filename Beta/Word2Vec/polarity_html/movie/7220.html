<PRE>                                THE 6TH MAN
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Even pure formula films can have their charms.  THE 6TH MAN
recycles ideas and dialog from a host of other movies.  Not being a
sports fan, I tire easily of films whose narrative consists of little
more than a fast drive to the big game, which will inevitably end in
the big shot that will catapult the underdogs to victory.  THE 6TH MAN
takes this sports film formula and crosses it with a remake of GHOST,
thus increasing the potential for disastrous results.  Generally
loathing slapstick comedies and being far from the audience's intended
demographical age of twelve plus or minus four, I, nevertheless,
enjoyed this sweet little film.</P>
<P>     Director Randall Miller, whose last picture was the poorly
received HOUSEGUEST, paints his film using broad humor mixed with a
tinge of pathos.  Kenny Tyler (Marlon Wayans) and his brother Antoine
(Kadeem Hardison) are basketball stars and buddies.  Their dad, whose
was their original coach, dies of a heart attack.  The boys grow up and
play college basketball for the University of Washington Huskies.</P>
<P>     The genuine chemistry between Kenny and Antoine puts extra punch
in their gentle jabs at each other.  "You should forget females,"
Antoine chides Kenny.  "Stick to Nintendo."</P>
<P>     Antoine dies of a heart attack just like his dad did.  Without his
brother, Kenny's play deteriorates and the team's hope for a
championship begins to fade rapidly.  Stepping into the void caused by
Antoine's lost, is Antoine, or rather Antoine's ghost.  He becomes the
invisible 6th man on the team, and he will propel the Huskies on to
victory.  He does this by such antics as picking up the Huskie players
and flying them up to the basketball hoop and by sitting on the
opposing team's hoop and keeping their balls from going in.</P>
<P>     Wayans and Hardison are instantly likable stars.  Their
cliche-ridden characters still manage to be engaging.  On the other
hand, David Paymer (from QUIZ SHOW and CITY HALL) gives an unbelievable
performance as the Huskies' Coach Peterson.  Exhibiting all of the
charisma and drive of a fishmonger, he urges his team to do their best.</P>
<P>     Although there are a couple of funny lines, the film derives most
of its laughs from the physical comedy surrounding the long running
joke that only Kenny can see his brother.  As the two brothers wrestle
with each other, as brothers do, it appears to others as if Kenny's
body is exploding in spasms.  Typical of the unoriginal dialog is the
scene in which Kenny is putting the moves on his would-be girlfriend,
R.C. St. John (Michael Michele).  After his ghostly brother does
something, he yells "Stop that."  To which, R.C. inquires, "Stop what?"
This scene and those words appear verbatim in almost every ghost movie.</P>
<P>     My favorite comedy routine in the show involves the team's mascot.
In the pre-game warm-up, the mascot tries out various gadgets to fling
himself into the air in a vain attempt to dunk the ball.  Always ending
in humorous pain to the mascot, the sequences are reminiscent of the
coyote in the Road Runner cartoon and his quest to find a gimmick that
will enable him to catch that pesky Road Runner.</P>
<P>     The show has some nice special effects where Antoine's body is
distorted in various ways.  One time, for example, he blows up his
thumb like a balloon which then disengages from his hand and whooshes
away.</P>
<P>     Other than the two stars, the other actors add little to advance
the story.  Michael Michele, as the girlfriend and snoopy reporter,
gives an uninspired performance in an underwritten role.  The
basketball team is a careful mix of characters of every type, but none
with any depth.  The threadbare and risk-adverse script by Christopher
Reed and Cynthia Carle needs more substance and originality.  They feed
a lot of one-liners to the on-court announcers, but most fall flat.
("Call 911 - that ball needs a doctor")</P>
<P>     No matter how minimal the supporting cast and the writing, the two
leads carry the show.  Their brotherly love radiates readily into the
audience.  I've seen their vaudevillian style of humor many times
before, but they are so good spirited that I still found myself
laughing with the rest of the crowd.</P>
<P>     THE 6TH MAN runs too long at 1:44.  It is rated PG-13 for some
profanity and innuendoes.  The film would be fine for kids 7 and up.
My son Jeffrey, almost 8, said, "I love it.  It is so good."  Since he
knew from the trailers that the lead character would die, he did not
become scared.  This upbeat show's comedic energy won me over enough to
be able to recommend it and give it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
