<P>     The original STAKEOUT, directed by John Badham, came out in 1987,
and was one of my favorite movies of the year.  It was a film that
skillfully blended its mixture of action and comedy into an
entertaining whole.  The chemistry between the three leads--Richard
Dreyfuss' Chris, Emilio Estevez' Bill, and Madeleine Stowe's Maria--was
as good as it comes in movies.  STAKEOUT ended up being more than just
another cop/buddy film.</P>
<P>     Now, six years later, John Badham is back along with Dreyfuss and
Estevez (and the entire production team, including the writer, Jim
Kouf, and the score composer, Arthur B. Rubinstein).  The relationship
between Chris and Bill hasn't changed much over six years, and neither
has the mingling of action and humor.  This time, Chris and Bill, along
with Rosie O'Donnell's assistant DA, are looking for a witness on the
run who's going to testify against the mob.  Posing as a family, they
move into a house next to the couple with whom contact may or may not
be initiated.  Another stakeout is under way.</P>
<P>     When I first received the credit list for this movie, I skimmed
through it to see who from the original would be returning.  Much to my
chagrin, Madeleine Stowe's name did not appear.  This, in my opinion,
was a huge mistake.  While Estevez and Dreyfuss worked well together,
it was the inclusion of Maria's character that lent an extra spark to
the movie.  It was hard to imagine how a STAKEOUT movie could function
well without her.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, however, Stowe's Maria is present in ANOTHER
STAKEOUT, albeit in an uncredited performance.  It's more than a cameo,
however.  She's in four scenes and has more screen time than at least
two of the actors whose names appear in the opening credits (Dan Lauria
and Sharon Maughan).  And yes, her scenes with Dreyfuss are still as
well-played as ever.  She may not have a major role in this
installment, but her inclusion is an especially nice tip of the cap to
continuity and what made the original movie effective.  Now, on to what
makes this film work.</P>
<P>     If done together well, comedy and action can make an excellent
pairing.  This has been proven many times, most notably in LETHAL
WEAPON and the original STAKEOUT.  It is evident here.  If anything,
this movie leans more towards outright humor than the first, and the
action is consequently toned down.  More importantly, ANOTHER STAKEOUT
doesn't try to copy the first.  The scenario is entirely different, as
are the gags and the tempo.</P>
<P>     The inclusion of Rosie O'Donnell, comedienne-turned-actress, is a
brilliant move.  Without her presence, this movie wouldn't have worked
nearly as well.  She forms a quick rapport with Bill and Chris (of the
love/hate variety), and the movie is off and running.  O'Donnell is
rapidly making an name for herself, and with good reason.  Unlike Rita
Rudner, another veteran of the stand-up routine who is venturing into
movies, O'Donnell can act.</P>
<P>     Dreyfuss is as solid as ever, and seems to genuinely enjoy playing
Chris.  He steals a fair number of scenes, but that's true of almost
any movie that he has a part in.  Emilio Estevez, never one of my
favorite actors, does a decent job.  He's much better in the scenes he
shares with Dreyfuss than those he has to carry on his own.  Of course,
that's not a big surprise.</P>
<P>     Miguel Ferrer is not as charismatic or successful a villain as
Aidan Quinn (whose performance as Maria's escaped convict ex-boyfriend
galvanized STAKEOUT), but he's good enough for the purposes of this
movie.  Dan Lauria is on hand again, reprising his role, although in
the interim spanning the two films, his character has gotten promoted
to chief, and he's just itching to find some way to stick it to his two
least-favorite detectives.</P>
<P>     ANOTHER STAKEOUT is tremendous fun.  There's a lot of highly
amusing (bordering on hilarious) humor, and the action scenes are
handled with an eye for pacing and tension.  If people find this gem in
the midst of so many bigger name motion pictures, this is likely to be
a huge crowd- pleaser.  Because of the uncertainty of whether it will
be noticed, I question the wisdom of releasing ANOTHER STAKEOUT at this
time.  Perhaps, like FOR LOVE OR MONEY, it should have been put off to
the autumn.</P>
<P>     In general, I don't think the second STAKEOUT is as good as the
first, but it is a worthy successor.  Since virtually everyone involved
in the 1987 picture is back for this one, the sense of continuity is
seamless, both in big and little things.  More importantly, because it
actually has an entertaining story to tell, this is not one of the
ever-growing number of sequels that should never have been made.  Fans
of the original movie will almost certainly be happy with ANOTHER
STAKEOUT, and those that didn't see it won't be lost.  This movie is
well worth a look.  It's one of the summer's best at providing
unfettered enjoyment.</P>
