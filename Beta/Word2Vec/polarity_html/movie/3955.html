<P>     The "usual suspects" are five men: Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), an
ex-cop-turned-crook who's known for his steely demeanor and nerves of iron;
Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), a psycho entry man; Todd Hockney (Kevin
Pollak), a hardware specialist with an instinct for self- preservation; Fred
Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), McManus' partner; and Verbal Klint (Kevin
Spacey), a crippled con man.  As the movie opens, these five are being
bundled into a lineup.  A truckload of stolen guns has been hijacked and the
cops, led by U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), are
primed to get their man.  But no one cracks, and as the criminals sit
together in jail waiting to be charged or released, they hatch a plan for an
elaborate emerald heist.</P>
<P>     The story is told in two different time frames.  In the present,
looking back on events, Klint sits across a desk from Kujan, unfolding the
tale as he remembers it.  But the con man is an unreliable narrator, and
viewers of THE USUAL SUSPECTS are constantly kept guessing about what
"truth" is.  In fiction films, we're used to getting an impartial take on
"reality;" this picture twists that principle.  Not everything presented in
THE USUAL SUSPECTS actually happens, and some things occur differently than
shown.  The opening sequence, which details the climax of the gang's capers,
teases the audience about what may or may not be the ultimate resolution.</P>
<P>     Director Bryan Singer, who debuted in 1993 with PUBLIC ACCESS, has
crafted another in the recent batch of '90s noir thrillers.  THE USUAL
SUSPECTS is steeped in atmosphere, and borrows heavily from dozens of
sources -- Hitchcock, Scorsese, the Coen brothers, and just about every
master of the genre, past or present.  Like Quentin Tarantino, Singer's
greatest strength is culling moments from other sources and using them in
his own mold.  There aren't many unique instances in THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but
the entire film is infused with a freshness that results from the manner in
which Singer has produced it.  The energetic, serpentine plot provides the
perfect playground in which a series of deliciously devious characters can
have fun.</P>
<P>     As the narrative progresses, THE USUAL SUSPECTS constantly raises the
stakes.  The audience is only slowly let into the story -- at the beginning,
everyone on-screen knows more than we do.  Gradually, however, the skein of
deceptions and plot devices is untangled by the switches back and forth
between present and past.  This film requires that a viewer pay careful
attention to details.  Those who get lost have only themselves to blame --
THE USUAL SUSPECTS doesn't take any prisoners.  A trip to the bathroom or
the snack bar will leave you floundering when you return.</P>
<P>     The cast is solid, and several of the actors play against type.  Kevin
Pollak (A FEW GOOD MEN), typically known for comic relief/nice guy roles, is
cold-blooded here.  Kevin Spacey (THE REF), in the best performance of the
film, is completely convincing as the gimpy coward who prefers jobs that
don't require killing.  Gabriel Byrne (LITTLE WOMEN) pulls off his role as
the most enigmatic of the quintet, and Stephen Baldwin (THREESOME) is the
perfect maniac.  Benicio Del Toro (FEARLESS) provides most of the humor,
much of which comes as a result of his nearly indecipherable accent.  The
supporting cast includes Giancarlo Esposito (DO THE RIGHT THING), Pete
Postlethwaite (IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER), Suzy Amis (THE BALLAD OF LITTLE
JO), and Dan Hedaya (BLOOD SIMPLE).</P>
<P>     Singer does an excellent job of blending humor into his noir thriller.
There's enough to avoid a sense of ponderousness, but not so much that THE
USUAL SUSPECTS becomes campy.  Unlike many motion pictures, this one
continually builds to its conclusion.  It starts out as the story of a small
job, then evolves into a search for the dreaded Keyser Soze -- a legendary
criminal of such viciousness that even hardened men like Keaton think twice
before crossing him.  As THE USUAL SUSPECTS moves towards its inevitable
finale, Soze's shadowy presence becomes increasingly more ominous and
important, and we get the sense that those who think they hold the cards
actually have the weakest hands.  In the way it folds its various elements
into a single resolution (which the astute viewer will be able to guess
beforehand), Singer's film can be accused of toying with the audience.
However, at times like this, when the person tugging the strings is adept at
his craft, being toyed with can be a worthwhile experience.  THE USUAL
SUSPECTS is an accomplished synthesis of noir elements and, as such, is an
entertaining entry to the genre.</P>
