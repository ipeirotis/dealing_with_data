<P>        Wild Things is a suspenseful thriller starring Matt Dillon, Denise 
Richards, and Neve Campbell that deals with all the issues; sex, love,
 murder, and betrayal.
        The setting of the film is a town named Blue Bay.  It consists of 
many swamps and slums and, on the other hand, rich estates owned by 
the town's different benefactors.  The film opens just before the 
beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy, expensive high 
school.  It is here that we meet all of the core characters.  There's 
guidance counselor Sam Lombardo, police officers Ray Duquette and 
Gloria Perez, dark mysterious senior Suzie Toller, and the popular 
head cheerleader Kelly Van Ryan.  We first see that all of the senior 
girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor, but none more 
than Kelly.          
        Throughout the first portion of the film we see how 
far Kelly will go to get Sam until she accuses him of rape.  Shortly 
after, Suzie, too, confesses that Sam raped her as well.  This pushes 
Kelly's sex craving mother, Sandra, to stop at nothing until Sam is 
convicted.  During the trial, Kelly gives a teary confession of how 
Sam raped her.  However, it is later revealed by Suzie that Sam never 
raped either of the girls, it was all a vengeful plan against the 
guidance counselor.  After Sam is cleared, Kelly's mother pays Sam a 
very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her.  It 
is then revealed that Sam, Kelly, and Suzie were all in on it 
together.  It is here that the film starts to reveal just who is 
being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda.
        Matt Dillon stars as Sam Lombardo.  Sam is the kind of guy that 
every woman would like to sink their claws into, and Sam obviously 
knows it and uses it to his own advantage.  He isn't the obvious best 
of actors, but Dillon does give a convincing performance.  However, 
his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film, 
making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and 
principles, although he never had many to start out with in the first 
place.
        Neve Campbell, who most people relate to Scream and Scream 2, plays 
Blue Bay outcast Suzie Toller.  Suzie obviously has some serious 
issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the 
film.  Campbell is very successful with this character, adding the 
slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making 
her fun to watch.  
        Playing Kelly Van Ryan is Denise Richards.  Kelly is your typical, 
rich, sexy, head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she 
choses, like her sexpot mother Sandra.  One of the most interesting 
things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the 
relationship between Kelly and her mother.  Denise Richards, still 
hot off the press from Starship Troopers, gives the most interesting 
performance in the entire film.  In the beginning, Kelly looks to be 
a paper thin character, but Richards adds a little more spice and 
ultimately makes the character not only sexy, but dominating as well.</P>
<P>        Kevin Bacon gives one of his fair performances as Ray Duquette.  
This character looks to be one of the most boring, predictable in the 
film.  However, it is a relationship revealed between him and Suzie 
that adds depth to his story.  Still, the film doesn't seem to gain 
much from Bacon's performance, only his name.  
        In the supporting cast, Theresa Russell plays the much oversexed 
Sandra Van Ryan, Daphne Rubin-Vega gives an unappealing performance 
as cop Gloria Perez, and Bill Murray shines as Sam's Lawyer, Ken 
Bowden.  Hats off to Murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to 
the film.
        Although Wild Things was displayed by the press as being an erotic 
thriller, the eroticism, which is portrayed with good taste, is kept 
to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships 
between the characters. 
        This is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a 
movie with a thick plot filled with it's share of twists.</P>
