<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A modern day comedy taking place in Havana, Cuba, that is laced with
supernatural implications, as it is directed with artful flourishes by
Fernando Perez. In the pulsating background, capturing the whimsical
mood of those who live in Havana, is the staccato music of Bola de Nieve
and Benny More. But the film suffers greatly in making every single
thing that happens pertain to a heavy-handed metaphorical symbol. The
hallucinatory story, as a result, is dumbed-down, so much so, that it
loses whatever strength and vision it might have had.</P>
<P>The three main characters, whose story is linked through the orphanage,
and one of them even has a mother named Cuba, that is, in case you don't
get that their stories are metaphors about the economic and political
situation in Communist Cuba. These three Cubans internalize their
personal struggles and strivings for happiness, as the film intersects
their tales by cutting from one character to the next, which makes all
their stories seem fuzzy. The three will eventually meet on Saint
Barbara's Day, December 4, in the Revolutionary Square, to see what
their fate is.</P>
<P>The film is playfully narrated by the 18-year-old Bebe (Bebe Perez) as
if she was a teenage Guardian Angel to the three, who is seen in her
narration in different locations and even underwater. Why she is the
narrator, is not clear, but she was an orphan with two of the other
characters and learned to whistle before she could speak, which upset
her teachers.</P>
<P>The film opens with a quote from John Lennon: Life is what happens to
you while you are busy doing other things. The film is heavy with quotes
like that one, as if these cute little slogans can really explain life
in Cuba.</P>
<P>The only one of the three stories that I found bearable, was about the
slender and attractive Mariana (Claudia Rojas). She is a promiscuous
ballerina. She is so interested in getting the starring part in Giselle,
that she makes a vow of chastity with God, that if she gets the part,
she will never sleep with another man.</P>
<P>She gets the part, and her dance partner is a dream come true, Ismael
(Joan Manuel Reyes). This leaves her in a tormented state, as he can't
understand why they don't make love, as she puts everything into the
dance and becomes Giselle, but is frustrated that she can't be with him.</P>
<P>Elpidio Valdes (Luis Alberto Garcia), a scrappy young musician, scam
artist, and fisherman, abandoned by his mother Cuba, who is wracked with
guilt because he hasn't lived up to her expectations of him. He even has
a tattoo on his back shoulder telling of his love for his mother.
Elpidio's chance to change comes when he steals money from the bag of a
tourist, Chrissy (Isabel Santos), a Greenpeace worker with a shaved
head, who comes into Cuba in a hot-air balloon. He returns the bag with
all her credit cards but without the money and the two carry on a hot
affair, as he brings her fish every day to keep the romance going. When
she is about to leave, she tells him she will be back in a month to see
him or he can leave with her now to the United States. We know he has
changed for sure, when he burns out his tattoo for his mother, and tells
her that he stole her money.</P>
<P>The most trite tale, is of Julia (Coralia Veloz), a middle-aged
do-gooder, the disconsolate social aid to the elderly, who is subject to
fits of yawning and fainting spells set off by the word "sex." Taken by
her friend to consult a psychiatrist, she uncovers a traumatic love
affair in her past, which she has repressed for the last twenty years.
The filmmaker gives Freud the importance of someone just being
discovered and repeating his theories as if they were fresh instead of
the cliches they have become to the Western world.</P>
<P>The film lost its focus and painted an artificially whimsical picture of
Cuba, that was hardly relevant or enlightening. Whatever pleaure there
was in the film, came from its splendid ballet numbers, the beautiful
artistic framing of its shots, and its bouncy music. But that was
outweighed by how it was weighed down from its symbolism.</P>
