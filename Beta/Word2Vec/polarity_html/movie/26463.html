<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Duets is the second feature film by longtime TV producer Bruce Paltrow
(A Little Sex), it stars his daughter Gwyneth. There are also some
interesting casting choices he makes such as, a cameo for Angie
Dickinson as Gwyneth's grandmother and the noted singer Huey Newton in a
starring role, whose expressions and looks reminded me of Sydney
Pollack.</P>
<P>Duets is a cross-country road comedy/drama whose stage is karaoke, which
uses that setting to explore the hopes of three twosomes headed for a
karaoke contest in Omaha. They search for what went wrong in their lives
as they try to come to terms with their family crisis: Ricky Dean (Huey
Lewis) is a selfish, enigmatic karaoke hustler, pretending not to know
what karaoke is as he works his hustle, who meets his daughter -- a
Vegas casino girl named Liv (Gwyneth Paltrow) -- for the first time at
the funeral of her Vegas showgirl mother; a toady traveling salesman,
Todd Woods (Paul Giamatti), who goes out for a pack of cigarettes but
doesn't return home when he gets a chilly reception from his suburban
wife and kids, after flying to Houston and thinking he's in Florida to
pitch a theme park. He leaves his family and becomes a deranged monster
railing against American culture and its misuse of the frequent flyer
miles perks the airlines advertise but do not deliver on what is
promised. He will give the ex-con Reggie Kane (Andre Braugher) a ride,
and their odd friendship will center around the salesman trying to break
the chains of his empty life by taking mood-altering drugs and singing
karaoke; and lastly, a young, underachieving, angelic Cincinnati
cabdriver, Billy (Scott Speedman), who reluctantly agrees to drive an
edgy waitress and hooker, Suzi Loomis (Maria Bello), with ambitions to
be a singer, to California, after he catches his wife sleeping with his
taxi partner, stopping off on the way for Suzi to compete in karaoke
bars for prize money, before going to Omaha with her when she wins her
competition.</P>
<P>The salesman story is the featured one, evoking a sense of the American
culture being a deadly one to one's psyche. This story is the most
bizarre and implausible, but it has the strength of bringing out a
number of small truths that add up, allowing the film to maintain a
quirky sense of justification for its messiness. Its impact is helped
greatly by the engagingly nuanced performances of Giamatti and Braugher.
I first thought Giamatti, who is not a household name as an actor, was
Wallace Shawn doing Giamatti. Giamatti, who turns from a meek salesman
to a terrorist-like maniac waving a gun at America's false dreams, gives
the film its finest vitality, as he gets to emote all screenwriter John
Byrum's best lines.</P>
<P>The two things this film has going for it in spades, is the lively
karaoke music and the unpredictability of its comedy, which gives the
film a very fresh feel, even overcoming the nonsense of its
interconnected stories and awkward sense of drama. These stories don't
exactly connect for these disenfranchised folks, but it shows what
happens to them psychologically when they come to a crossroads in Omaha,
making it appear to be the Super Bowl for dreamers in the world of
karaoke -- their chance to heal their wounded egos as they steal someone
else's talent for a few moments and call it theirs.</P>
<P>The film starts off in a karaoke bar in Tulsa, where Ricky is a karaoke
hustler, if there is such an animal as that, it's new to me -- but his
thing is to bet other performers that he can top them, betting a huge
sum of money over the usual $100 first-place prize. There is also a trip
to Omaha for the winner, where the competition is national and the prize
money is significantly higher at $5,000, but considering the way money
has been thrown around in contests with less skill than this one, this
is still a very low figure as a payoff. This hustling bit brought back
memories of Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason as pool sharks in the "The
Hustler," or more recently Matt Damon as a card hustler in the
"Rounders." The hustle is more than what the money can bring them,
therefore the stakes aren't as important as what the rush brings to
their ego.</P>
<P>When father and daughter bond in Vegas, he has no choice but to take her
to Omaha, where he sees that she can also belt out a tune karaoke style.
She does a marvelous rendition of "Bette Davis Eyes." But their story
was rather tame, as there was nothing touching about their relationship
and nothing revealed that wasn't expected, it played as if something was
left out but that it wasn't important to find out what that was. Yet
their chemistry was good together, making their story most watchable
one.</P>
<P>The story that seemed the most forced was the cabbie and the whore on
the run one. She turns out to be like all the other karaoke performers,
needing someone else's tender love to make the world a warmer place.
This vignette took its dramatics too seriously and explained their
obvious emergency relationship in too fine a matter for how absurd it
all seemed.</P>
<P>I must applaud the film for not emphasizing the competition at the
contest, as so many recent commercial films have in such films, and for
taking a chance and going for some dramatic fireworks in a screwball
comedy. That it doesn't always come together as a fluid film, is pushed
aside by how zany and entertaining it was, with a good sense of energy
released through some risks that were taken by not trying to put
together a familiar film. I have a good feeling about this film and
think it will stay around as a cult favorite and grow in status over the
years.</P>
