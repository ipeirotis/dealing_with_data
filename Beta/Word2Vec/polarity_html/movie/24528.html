<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Fritz Lang was a leading German filmmaker by 1931 before the Nazi regime
got full control of the country. In 1933, when they did get full
control, he emigrated to America, worrying that he might become out of
favor with the Nazis due to having Jewish relations and would also be
reduced to making propaganda films if he stayed. He left behind his
pro-Nazi wife Thea von Harbou--the screenwriter of all his films in the
'20s and '30s, including "M." In this film, about a child-murderer, his
first talkie, it was made with surprisingly the highest sound quality,
which is quite an achievement if you keep in mind how this was his first
experience with that new medium. The film was at first called Murderers
Among Us and because of that title, he was denied permission to use a
film studio, that is, until he changed the title to "M" (the initial
standing for murderer) when he discovered that the Nazis had taken the
original title to refer to them.</P>
<P>In the following articles, one in the Los Angeles Herald Express, 12
August 1947 & the other an article by Lang: Why I am interested in
Murder. New York, 1947, Lang stated why he has such an avid interest in
murder: "Gradually, and at times reluctantly, I have come to the
conclusion that every human mind harbors a latent compulsion to murder."
He goes on to state: "I have tried to approach the murderer
imaginatively to show him as a human being possessed of some demon that
has driven him beyond the ordinary borderlines of human behavior, and
not the least part of whose tragedy is that by murder he never resolves
his conflicts."</P>
<P>You can chalk "M" up as a lasting masterpiece, created with a passion
for detail and a successful transitional film from the silents to the
talkies, taking into its mise en scene the best of both those worlds. At
its best, "M" emulates the accomplishments found in all the great works
of poetry. It is still the greatest of all the serial killer films made,
even if it is mistakeningly considered by some, now, as merely a museum
piece. All you have to do is compare the depth of its storytelling with
the greatest films of that genre, a genre that Lang's film spawned, such
as Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs. Lang's thriller has the
advantage of not only understanding the psycho's motivations but
encompassing how an entire society was drawn into the murder, as most of
the film revolves around the search for the killer. And, when you
compare it to a slick thriller, like the recent American Psycho, it is
not difficult to see how shallow that one is in comparison.</P>
<P>This thriller was based on a real-life manhunt in Dusseldorf for a
serial child-murderer, Peter Kurten. The film is subversive in many
ways; it expresses Lang's many long-held opinions on why the murderer
can't help doing what he does and how society has become debased. It
also explores the responsibility a mother has to watch her own children,
the pros and cons of capital punishment, and, he also aims to point out
what goes beyond the scope of human interest and emotions, as he wanted
to make a statement relating the murders to the unequal distribution of
wealth. He shows how the rich have more free time to look after their
children because they have the financial resources, while the poor must
constantly be busy working. He, thereby, purposefully, opens and closes
the film, with the children playing unsupervised games in their
working-class neighborhoods.</P>
<P>The big German city is aghast at the number of little girls reported
murdered in the newspaper, as Lang's camera sweeps the different city
sections, with different wide-angled shots and shots from his signature
overhead sweeps (something he used first, despite Orson Welles taking so
many bows for this kind of shot and never acknowledging that Lang did it
first), and his long close-ups, as each group is shown with their own
reaction to the events.</P>
<P>The little girls play outside in their yard and sing songs about the
bogeyman who will come and take them away. Their mothers react with
pained expressions on their faces, while they are busy scrubbing
clothes. The police, under the leadership of the corpulent Inspector
Lohmann (Otto Wernicke), complain that they have no clues to help them,
that the public is not helping them by giving them false leads, which is
wearing the police down, as they are pressured to be working
around-the-clock to catch the culprit. The underworld is upset that the
police are cracking down on their illegal establishments by repeated
raids, arresting them at will, and thereby putting a big dent into their
business. They are particularly upset that the police should think that
it is one of them who is committing this low-life crime. Under the
leadership of a renown gangster, Schranker (Gustaf Grundgens), the
various gangs get together with the beggars' organization called in to
help. They plan to capture the killer and take care of him with their
own method of justice. What is noteworthy to observe, is how Lang draws
parallels between the police investigation and the underworld's. The
police take fingerprints from a letter the killer wrote the newspaper,
they have a psychologist profile the killer as someone who is a
pathological sex pervert, and they note the type of pencil he used, the
brand of cigarettes he smoked, and the type of wood table he used to
write on. While, the underworld has everyone in their organization
become their eyes and ears, as they put someone on every block to watch
for the killer.</P>
<P>The murderer, Franz Becker (Peter Lorre), is first heard telling the
girl he is about to kill, what a beautiful ball she has and then asking
the little girl her name. His face is not seen, it is only seen that he
is wearing a fedora, as a cute little girl, Elsie Beckmann (Inge
Landgut), tells him her name, as she is bouncing a brightly colored ball
off a post that has an announcement for a 10,000 marks reward for
information about the killer. He lures the innocent girl away by buying
her candy and a balloon from a blind vender (Georg John), as the vender
will recognize him later by his distinguishable whistle taken from a few
bars of Grieg's "In the Hall of the Mountain King." This tune will
become the ominous leitmotif throughout the film. Since Lorre couldn't
whistle, it was Lang's whistling that was used. Her death will first be
telegraphed to the viewer by her balloon blowing in the wind, as it is
stuck on the telegraph wires, and with her mother's sad expression, as
she stares at her empty chair by the dining table that has her plate and
silverware on it.</P>
<P>Panic reaches across the city anew with the discovery of Elsie
Beckmann's death, with citizens accusing others of being the killer for
illogical reasons, of petty criminals being picked up for minor offenses
who challenge the police by saying:'Better catch the child
murderer.'Because of the murders, people are willing to go to any
extreme to blame someone for the crime, even if they have no proof, as
an innocent man is attacked by a mob after just talking to a little
girl. It is evident that Lang saw here the festering wounds Nazism would
later on fully exploit to its own advantages, in a society that was
already decadent and had lost its sense of responsibility. He sensed
they were looking for law and order and would even readily accept the
Nazi dictatorship that limited their freedom, just because they wanted a
change.</P>
<P>The police and the underworld begin to close in on the killer using
their different styles of tracking him down, but what remains striking,
is how similar they are in character, as Lang shows how each of them
meet to handle the problem -- with Schranker, representing the
underworld, the equal of Lohmann, who represents the police.</P>
<P>The earthy Lohmann, being a stickler for details, finds spelling errors
in the newspaper note the killer sent, indicating the killer is not
well-educated. He also gets a list of all the mental patients released
in the past few years and has his men check them out. One of his men
goes to Becker's apartment and will bring back evidence of Ariston
cigarettes the same brand found by the crime scene and he will later on
show that the killer wrote the note on the windowsill of Becker's
apartment. The police will have a stakeout in that apartment, waiting
for the killer's return.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the blind balloon vender recognizes the whistle of the
killer's, as he is again luring a little girl with his friendly ways. He
has his helper follow him and too make the tail easier, a large 'M'
chalk mark is placed on the shoulder of the killer's coat by the young
helper as he bumps into the killer. The whole scene with the beggars in
pursuit of the killer, was reminiscent of the leftist Bertold Brecht's
"The Three Penny Opera,"as all the beggars signal each other with
whistles and chase the killer into an office building. Later in the
night, the underworld criminals overtake the two watchmen and eventually
find the killer in the attic, after taking the whole building apart in
their search.</P>
<P>What gives this film its power, is how the entire city is analyzed by
how they react to the crime. When the underworld corners Lorre, trapping
him like an animal, the audience watches him scurry around for dear life
in the office building, and when they capture and take him to an
abandoned warehouse, they give him a mock trial in a dark dungeonlike
basement, just the right atmosphere to bring the film to a climax. With
the criminal element getting to him first, the question seriously
becomes what is the proper punishment for such a misfit, as the
criminals, an unofficial jury of his peers, respond the way 'the man in
the street' would, that it is better off for society if he were dead.
The answer for Lang, is that the people themselves must decide in a
court of law what kind of punishment is warranted. The only thing Lang
does with his objective camera, is try to understand the killer, not
sympathize with him. For this stance, he even earned praised from the
Nazis through their propaganda minister, Goebbels, who called the film
"fantastic, free of phony humanitarian sentiments."</P>
<P>Inspector Lohmann grills a burglar caught in the office building, who
won't say what he was doing there, until the inspector tricks him, by
telling him he will be charged for murdering the watchman. He then tells
the police that the underworld was there to get the killer and where
they took him to trial. Lang, by having the law come in on the
underworld's mock trial and impede it, further asks what is true justice
for a murderer, the most serious crime one can commit in this life!</P>
<P>The film is expeditious in its stark treatment of the innocuous Lorre,
who does not stand out from the crowd and is physically a small and
fragile man. He defends himself to his fellow jurors, by basically
borrowing Jesus' words: "Who is without sin to cast aspersions on
another." As he cries out that he can't help himself, as the criminals
look at him intently, while some are jeering at his pleas, appalled to
hear him use the same excuses many of them have used. He finally screams
out, getting the pity of a few, "I have no control over my urges. I want
to escape from myself, but it is impossible." Facing a certain lynching,
the police come in, supposedly, to get him a trial where he will either
be executed or sent away to a mental institution. But, as noted by the
mourning mothers of the victims, his punishment can't bring back their
little girls (this version was eliminated from the later showings of the
film).</P>
<P>Peter Lorre became a recognized star as a result of this film and
deservedly so, even though his speaking part was minimal and came only
toward the end of the film, when he movingly confesses how evil sits
inside him. His image in the film fits a description the public could
readily identify from now on as that of a child-killer, of a creepy man
and a loner, unable to function in society, who lures children by
pretending to be their nice uncle to buy them candy. Lorre, being
Jewish, fled Germany for America in the early thirties, and was typecast
for this kind of role his entire Hollywood career as a result of this
film.</P>
