<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A love triangle among grifters (con artists), that plays out as a film noir
morality tale. It is adapted from Jim Thompson's hard-boiled 1950s book, as the
British director Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liaisons) sets the action in
contemporary Los Angeles. It follows the trail of three grifters. The main story
is about 25-year-old Roy Dillon (Cusack), who is a small-time con man who does
nickel-and-dime jobs but saves his money and has built up a large nest egg. He
is the one the two women fight over, and is the only one who is worth saving.
His 39-year-old mother, Lilly (Anjelica Huston), is someone who has been a
terrible mother. She works for the Mob in Baltimore by pulling a playback scheme
at the racetrack--which involves manipulating the odds so that the bookies will
maintain a profit no matter which horse wins. She also would like to leave the
Mob, but can't. Her tough demeanor and artful ability to survive, are what keep
her going. Roy's sexy but dangerous girlfriend is Myra Langtry (Bening), who for
ten years worked as a sex lure for businessmen in a deadly broker scam in Texas
and is now looking for that type of bigger action again. These three can't trust
one another, as they are thrown together by strange circumstances and are
reduced to trying to hustle each other. </P>
<P>This modern film noir story turns out to be a forceful and dark look at how evil
all the grifters are, as they go from crimes of cheating to killing. The film is
marvelously acted by Anjelica Huston, who received an Oscar nomination for Best
Actress. It also has a tight script by Donald E. Westlake. </P>
<P>In the opening scenes, Roy gets punched in the stomach by a bartender who
catches him working a money changing scam. He gets change for a $20 bill and
then switches to a ten dollar bill. At the same time, Lilly has been sent by her
nasty boss Bobo (Hingle) to work the Los Angeles track. When she shows up at
Roy's fleabag hotel to see what he's been up to after being estranged for many
years, as he went to live on his own when he was just 17, she meets Myra there
and the two instantly hate each other. She is not fooled by his talk of being a
salesman, and lectures him on the negatives of being a grifter: "You either go
up or down, sooner or later. Usually down." She also notices how badly hurt he
is and rushes him to a hospital just in time for emergency treatment to save his
life. </P>
<P>At the hospital she meets Myra again, and the two go into a war mode for the
attention of Roy. Roy has been so damaged by his callous upbringing, that he
treats both women with contempt. Firstly, refusing Lilly's offers of help with
money and maternal advice. Secondly, turning down Myra's bid for him to go
partners with her in the stock scam. He views them both as being alike. Myra is
desperate for another partner, as her other partner, the one who taught her the
ropes, Cole (J.T. Walsh), has cracked and is now in the mental ward of a prison.</P>
<P>The story builds in violence and perversion and shocks, and by the climactic
scene the untalented grifter Roy, who believes he can leave the business any
time he wants to, has to face his crafty mother in an Oedipal situation. He's no
match for the mother who never wanted a kid, but raised him when she was only a
kid herself at 14. What she now exerts over him is a dominating will, and their
relationship doesn't provide much meaning but it is absorbing to watch. It's a
film that doesn't leave you with much to think about afterwards, but while it
played its grit and pulp qualities shine in the darkness. The film could have
been better served with a more spirited actress than Bening, who's best asset is
her body. While Cusack seemed to not fit what a noir character should be like,
as he seemed to be more like a guy who was just trying to be a good grifter. He
looked like he would have fit more into a sports film than this one. But the
film still works as a modern film noir vehicle, as the script didn't have depth
but it provided a full blast of cynicism and shocks that played into the dark
plot rather well. If it's a dark, sleazy film, that is well-crafted that you are
in the mood for, then this one should be right up your alley. </P>
