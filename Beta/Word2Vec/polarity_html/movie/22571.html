THE RIGHT STUFF
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>People who enjoy science fiction are often faced with
unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of
novels, stories, comic books or movies. Often science
fiction aficionados find material, previously labelled as
science fiction, to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror,
or rather simple techno-thriller. In such cases, mistakes
are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly
marked. But, I believe there are really few cases when a
movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be
straight historical epic. Such thing occurred in former
Yugoslavia some fifteen years ago, when national
distributors gave such treatment to THE RIGHT STUFF, 1983
film directed by Philip Kaufman.</P>
<P>The mistake of the distributors could be explained with the
fact that the official poster of the film features men in
space suits. But THE RIGHT STUFF film isn't even fiction. It
was based on the non-fiction book by Tom Wolfe, covering the
early years of American space program. The plot of the film
begins in 1947 when few people heard of Edwards Air Force
Base, major test site for experimental planes. The major aim
of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft
to reach 1 Mach speed and thus break the sound barrier. Many
pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their
lives for such bravado. But one quiet pilot, Chuck Eager
(played by Sam Shaped) succeeds and thus gives example for
whole new generation of test pilots, determined to enter
history books by breaking new speed records. Ten years
later, Soviets have launched "Sputnik" marking the beginning
of the Space Age. In order to regain national prestige, US
government decides to be the first to send man into space.
Best Air Force, Navy and Marine pilots are recruited into
program, but not Yeager, because he lacks college education
and desired all-American image.</P>
<P>In one of critics' polls THE RIGHT STUFF was named as one
among top 10 films made in 1980s. Such high position could
be explained with the fact that Kaufman's film looks quite
atypical for its time. With more than three hours of length
and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s -
age when Hollywood used to make films larger than life. But
the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly
remarkable and talented filmmaker. Philip Kaufman created
reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that
Golden Age in order to create original, memorable movies.
THE RIGHT STUFF was the last of them, swan song of an era
when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on
unusual, risk-taking "artsy" projects.</P>
<P>THE RIGHT STUFF is unusual because it lacks many standard
elements of Hollywood film. The plot is almost non-existent
and not very coherent; the story, featuring many interesting
incidents and anecdotes, shifts focus from the old
generation of test pilots, embodied in Yeager, to new
generation of the astronauts. The film also lacks
conventional protagonist - Yeager (who also appears in small
cameo) remains the true hero of the film, but equal time and
exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives,
making this movie into ensemble piece. That gave opportunity
for Kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents, until
that specialised only for bit or character roles. Sam
Shepard is great as Yeager, war hero whose greatest
achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained
obscured in history books, probably due to his own modesty.
On the surface, he lacks personality compared with his hyped
and more fortunate astronaut colleagues, but Shepard gives
texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases.
Shepard's performance is followed with great acting by Ed
Harris as clean-cut Marine (and future politician) John
Glenn. Young Dennis Quaid is more than fine as arrogant
fighter jock Gordo Cooper, and this arrogance is mirrored in
his friend and most tragic figure of Virgil Grissom,
superbly played by Fred Ward. Always reliable character
actor Scott Glenn provides some comic relief as Navy aviator
and (arguably) first American man in space Alan Shepard.
Kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - Barbara
Hershey, Pamela Reed, Veronica Cartwright and Mary Jo
Deschanel are great as pilots' wives. Royal Dano is also
impressive as menacing figure of Preacher, but the most
memorable performances belong to Donald Moffat as
Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson and Jane Dornacker as Nurse
Murch.</P>
<P>Great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored
with Kaufman's superb direction. Most notable of all is the
methods Kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of
time. The beginning of the film shows test pilots living in
the middle of desert, as virtual unknowns, far away from
strict rules and discipline. Everything seems natural
-Yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards
away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the
world. In that setting, it's quite normal for important
technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for
the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before
most important flights. But the times are changing; WW2
alliance with USSR is replaced with Cold War, and "natural"
pilots like Yeager must be replaced with more disciplined,
conventional pilots. Their entire lives become focus of
media frenzy, and their job is subjected to strict rules,
meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats,
publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists (like
former Nazi rocket expert Werner von Braun, played by Scott
Beach) only to preserve their most basic human dignity. This
contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence
- while Yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test
flight in absolute obscurity, "Mercury" astronauts receive
fame and fortune, although some of them even before going in
the space.</P>
<P>Those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with
Kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language. Editing is
great, and photography by Caleb Deschanel provides many
memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or
astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion (the same
image would be copied in many latter films). Although
Kaufman enjoyed support of NASA and American military, which
provided authentic locations and period equipment, he still
had to use special effects in order to simulate space
flights. Those effects are excellent and they can still fool
the audience accustomed to CGI and real footage of Earth
from outer space. Another fine contribution of this film is
"Oscar"-awarded musical score by Bill Conti; I still tremble
from excitement every time I hear it. It is accompanied with
the use of Holst and Debussy. Some of the songs used in the
background also provide authentic atmosphere of the
historical period.</P>
<P>This film is great, and its cult status is well deserved,
but there are some minor flaws. Some of the "Mercury"
astronauts aren't fleshed out enough (although being played
by fine actors, like Lance Henriksen). Film also lacks
proper closure. On the other hand, most logical conclusion
of the film - landing on the Moon - would require this film
to be more than six hours long. Also, some critics were
prone to attack this film as too Amerocentric and hard on
Russians, who were portrayed as evil monsters, just in line
with most virulent Cold War rhetoric of Reagan's America. In
some of contemporary interviews, Kaufman defended that
approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as
authentic as possible, and in order to do that, he portrayed
Russians not as they were in real life, but as they were
perceived by Americans in early 1960s.</P>
<P>Time has passed; now we don't see astronauts as heroes. In
this age of widespread satellite communications and routine
space missions, those men and women in space suits are seen
as mere maintenance workers. Few young boys want to be
astronauts when they grow up. But this film, sentimental
reminder of the times "when future began", perhaps could
encourage at least some of them to follow "Mercury"
astronauts' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky. And
even if they decide to stay on Earth, they could still
appreciate THE RIGHT STUFF as an extraordinary piece of
cinema.</P>
