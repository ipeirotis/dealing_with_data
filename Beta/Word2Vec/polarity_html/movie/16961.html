<PRE>THE COMMISSIONER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>THE COMMISSIONER is a film that is as cold and flat as a Brussels winter,
where the film is set.  If you think making a suspense story about the
European Commission would not exactly be a natural, you'd be right.  As the
backdrop for a political thriller, it doesn't have much credible oomph.</P>
<P>The film opens with the suicide of Hans Konig (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a
research scientist who recently blew the lid off of his employer's illegal
manufacture of chemical weapons.  The rest of the story happens in flashback
as we learn why Hans took his life.</P>
<P>British cabinet minister James Morton, played nicely by John Hurt, is
sacked.  His consolation prize is being offered the position as the British
Commissioner on the European Commission, a position widely derided as
useless.  His wife wishes him well but tells him that she's not going with
him.  She also mentions his wandering eye, so, of course, we can count on
there being a sexy woman he will hit it off with in his new position.</P>
<P>The commission is asked to approve -- rubber stamp would be more accurate --
the merger of a large British chemical company with a large German one.
James raises objections when he is passed the documents about chemical
weapons that the German company is supposedly producing.  The story is all
heavily clichéd.  (Have I mentioned the old Nazi connection yet?)</P>
<P>Christina Kallas's script is filled with macho industrialists spouting
pompous, hackneyed lines, like "Remember this, James, the weak perish."  My
personal "favorite" is the rich American capitalist with the large cowboy
hat, who warns, without cracking a smile, "Cemeteries are filled with people
who underestimated me."  It's enough to make students want to bypass
chemical engineering and business majors as too malevolent.</P>
<P>In a slow movie that suffers from a lack of twists, the ending twist is
laughably implausible.  Only John Hurt's performance partially saves the
movie.</P>
<P>THE COMMISSIONER runs 1:48.  It is not yet rated but will probably be an R
for some profanity, violence and sexuality and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
