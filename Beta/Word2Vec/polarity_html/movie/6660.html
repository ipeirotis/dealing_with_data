<P>     Try to keep up, there will be a test later:  JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST
STRIKE is the American theatrical release of the Hong Kong film POLICE
STORY 4: FIRST STRIKE, which was the sequel to POLICE STORY 3: SUPERCOP,
which was released in America last year as just plain SUPERCOP.  Then
there was another sequel to SUPERCOP, which also was called POLICE STORY 4
but was more widely known as PROJECT S, though that is something of a
tangent.  In the earlier POLICE STORY films, Jackie Chan's character was
called Chen Chia-chu; now in FIRST STRIKE, he is simply Jackie.  The
strange re-release patterns inspired by Chan's sudden American popularity
has made it nearly impossible to make any sense of the POLICE STORY
chronology, if making sense of things like this matter to you.  FIRST
STRIKE itself makes only a rudimentary kind of sense, but Chan's
hair-raising stunts and affable demeanor rarely require much set-up to be
enjoyable.</P>
<P>     Jackie, a Hong Kong cop, is on an assignment for the American CIA to
watch a woman called Natasha (Grishajeva Nonna) as the film opens, a
simple enough task on an airplane to the Ukraine.  It becomes less simple
when Natasha turns out to be smuggling American dollars to a man named
Tsui, dollars which will be used to purchase a Ukranian nuclear warhead
for sale on the black market.  Jackie is soon recruited by a Russian
intelligence agent named Gregor (Jouri Petrov) to track down Tsui, and
heads to Australia where Tsui's sister Annie (Chen Chun Wu) works at an
aquatic theme park.  Though Jackie is able to find Annie, he also finds
that Tsui's motives are unclear, and that Gregor may have a dark agenda of
his own.</P>
<P>     FIRST STRIKE is the third Jackie Chan feature in less than a year to
get an American release, following RUMBLE IN THE BRONX and SUPERCOP, and
it is certainly the biggest production of the three.  There are a couple
of off-hand references to James Bond in FIRST STRIKE, and that seems to be
the vibe director Stanley Tong is going for this time around.  A chase
sequence involving gun-toting skiers is straight out of FOR YOUR EYES
ONLY; the underwater battles in a shark tank with oxygen the most prized
possession is vintage THUNDERBALL.  The scenery shifts from Hong Kong to
the Ukraine to Australia, serving up a few sacrificial vehicles
(helicopters, a funeral carriage) for big-time explosions.  Throw in a
Saul Bass opening credits sequence and a vodka martini and you might think
007 had become a celibate Asian.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, while FIRST STRIKE is the grandest of Chan's American
releases, it is also the least charming, for most of the same reasons.
Jackie Chan films don't work because of large scale set pieces; they work
because Chan himself is extremely personable and because his unmatched
fight choreography can make you giddy with pleasure.  The moments when
Chan gets to show his stuff up close are wonderful -- he flips through
windows as though he were made of paper, dances across rooftops, uses an
inflatable pool toy to walk quite literally on water.  The extended
sequence where he takes on four men by turning a broom, papier mache
dragon heads and an eight foot ladder into weapons is one of the most
spectacular hand-to-hand combat sequences I have ever seen on screen, a
combination of martial arts and acrobatics edited with astonishing
fluidity.  While the more elaborate bits fall flat with ho-hum
familiarity, the seven minutes of that one fight sequence make FIRST
STRIKE worth seeing.</P>
<P>     The very end of that sequence may be just as indicative of what makes
a Jackie Chan action film unique.  After battling the four opponents to a
standstill, Jackie watches a dozen new foes arrive, and slumps to the
ground in resignation.  As superhuman as Chan can be on screen, he is also
quite human in his persona.  In one clever scene, Jackie exchanges blows
with a massive Russian in typical chop-socky fashion, assumes his standard
preparatory fighting stance, then cringes at the punishment he has just
absorbed.  He doesn't endear himself to the audience by tossing off dreary
one-liners; he simply plays a guy, sometimes silly and sometimes
embarrassed, who happens to be able to defy gravity.  JACKIE CHAN'S FIRST
STRIKE is a terminally dopey spy thriller with anyone else in the lead
role.  Jackie Chan alone is enough to make the thought of FIRST STRIKE 2
-- or is that SUPERCOP 3, or POLICE STORY 5? -- somewhat appealing.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 fighting Chans:  6.</PRE>
