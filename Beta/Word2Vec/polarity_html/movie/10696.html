<P>     Arguably, the Spice Girls are to the 1990s what ABBA was to the 
1970s.  Despite their radically different compositions, both groups have 
a lot in common.  Just like ABBA twenty years ago, the Spice Girls are 
pop wonders who manage to rise consistently to the top of the music 
charts despite the essential vapidity of their hits.  And, although they 
get very little respect from "serious" music lovers, they continue to 
sell albums at an alarming rate.  Now, for better or worse, the Spice 
Girls have done something that ABBA never did:  starred in a movie.</P>
<P>     It's worth noting at the outset that I am definitely not a member 
of the target audience for this movie.  I'm not a screaming pre-teen 
girl or a hormone-crazed 12-year old boy.  I'm also not a Spice Girls 
fan.  Actually, going into the film, I was rather neutral towards them.  
As SPICE WORLD's running length dragged on, however, and I was subjected 
to one repetitive song after another, I began to develop an active 
dislike for the singing group.  They may be pleasant to look at, but 
their irritating antics as presented here are enough to put someone off 
of them permanently.  Suffice it to say that I won't be buying the 
soundtrack.</P>
<P>     The movie's premise is as flimsy as can be, but it least it doesn't 
require a whole lot of acting from the main quintet of Baby Spice (Emma 
Bunton), Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), 
Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm), and Posh Spice (Victoria Adams).  SPICE 
WORLD follows the group as they travel around London getting ready for a 
big concert at the Albert Hall.  Along the way, they endure photo 
shoots, constant attention from the paparazzi, pressure from their 
neurotic manager (Richard E. Grant), interference from a documentary 
film maker (Alan Cumming), and the attempts of a tabloid owner (Barry 
Humphries) and his chief photographer (Richard O'Brien) to split them 
up.  In the end, however, they triumph over all adversity and wow their 
fans.</P>
<P>     The press package for SPICE WORLD makes the jaw-dropping statement 
that the film is "a '90s version of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT with a pinch of 
THIS IS SPINAL TAP and a dash of SPEED".  Time for a reality check.  Any 
similarities between SPICE WORLD and those three films are entirely 
superficial.  The SPEED citation points to a brief parody of a high-
speed bus chase, and nothing more.  No aspect of SPICE WORLD's 
occasional pseudo-documentary approach comes close to the acid edge 
achieved by SPINAL TAP.  And, although the film is clearly trying to 
follow in the footsteps of the Beatles' classic, it's several long 
strides behind, lacking the same sense of originality, spontaneity, high 
energy, and joi de vie.  Not to mention the differences in music 
quality.  A HARD DAY'S NIGHT was a breath of fresh air; SPICE WORLD is 
recycled.</P>
<P>     The film is littered with unexpected cameos (Stephen Fry, Bob 
Hoskins, Elton John, Hugh Laurie, Meat Loaf, Jennifer Saunders, Richard 
Briers, Elvis Costello).  Some can surely be attributed to the 
involvement of film maker Bob Spiers, who is a directing icon for the 
British sit-com industry.  During his long career, he has helmed 
episodes of "Fawlty Towers," "Are You Being Served," "Alexi Sayle," "A 
Bit of Fry and Laurie," and "Absolutely Fabulous."  Sadly, however, 
Spiers doesn't generate enough laughter here, and even the "name the 
next familiar face" game can't save the film.</P>
<P>     Although the Spice Girls, who appear comfortable in front of the 
camera, are the headliners, there are a few legitimate performers in the 
film.  Richard E. Grant leads the pack as an intentionally over-the-top 
neurotic who quickly got on my nerves.  Alan Cumming, Barry Humphries, 
George Wendt (as an American movie producer), Richard O'Brien (best 
known as Riff Raff from THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW), and Claire 
Rushbrook (as the Girls' assistant) all have more than a few seconds of 
screen time.  Then there's Roger Moore, who, as "The Chief," finds 
himself satirizing his part as James Bond (although some would argue 
that his tenure in that role ended in self-parody).  While sipping 
shaken (not stirred) vodka martinis, stroking a cat, and living a life 
of luxury, he utters such nonsensical profundities as "A headless 
chicken can only know where he has been.  He cannot see where he is 
going."  </P>
<P>     SPICE WORLD is a vanity project -- an ego trip designed to show the 
five girls in the best possible light and give them a chance to perform 
about 14 numbers on-screen.  As a comedy, it's weak, because most of the 
jokes are obvious and not especially funny.  As a satire, it's weaker, 
because the screenplay never takes any chances and all of the mini 
parodies are safe, silly, and creatively lifeless.  The film isn't even 
a particularly good musical, because the songs are so inane.  The only 
people who are likely to be able to sit through SPICE WORLD without 
casting numerous yearning glances at the exit are those who number 
themselves among the group's legion of die-hard fans.  Ultimately, this 
film has too much Spice and not enough flavoring.</P>
