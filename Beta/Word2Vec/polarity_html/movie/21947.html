<PRE>The World Is Not Enough
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Pierce Brosnan; Sophie Marceau; Robert Carlyle; Denise Richards &
Robbie Coltrane</P>
<P>Let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest Bond
film, I really wasn't looking forward to it as much as I have with some of
the previous films. I'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or
the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable
ways of the Timothy Dalton years. I'm happy to report that any doubts were
erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film. By that point, it was
evident that Mr. Bond was back with a vengeance. All doubts would have
probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes
of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience. It seems that nobody told
the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be
turned off when the movie starts. It took a reminder from an audience member
to clue them in. I guess they can be excused though, taking tickets and
cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain.</P>
<P>Anyway, after somebody remembered what the light switch was for, I settled
in for Bond. I think the most noticeable aspect of this, the 19th film in
the series, is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style
of the Roger Moore films. There were probably more one-liners in this movie
than in the last several combined. And Bond's last one-liner in the film is
about the best of the series. The World Is Not Enough also contained perhaps
the most action of any movie of the series. Everything from wild boat chases
to the usual assortment of cool Bond gadgets trotted out just when there
seems to be no way out for 007. For the most part, the action sequences
worked very well. Although, there were a couple of times that I thought some
things were a bit over the top, even for a Bond film. I think some of the
blame can be laid at the feet of director Michael Apted. While he did a good
job for the most part, there were points in the movie, specifically during
action sequences, that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was
making essentially an action film. Most noticeably sequences on a snow
covered mountain and one involving Bond getting through a closing door
looked like Apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie.
He almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing. But they were brief
scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that
Apted did in directing.</P>
<P>If you have ever seen a Bond film, you won't be shocked to learn that plot
has never been their strong suit. The World Is Not Enough is no exception.
This time we have yet another over villain that Bond has to stop for the
good of the world. 007 matches wits with the terrorist Renard (Robert
Carlyle), a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him
impervious to pain. Why this point is included is beyond me. They took great
pains to explain his condition, but it only came up later in the movie as a
scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought. Anyway,
Renard, like the typical terrorist that he is, is bent on some harebrained
scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline. I guess world domination just
isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore. Bond is
brought in to protect the pipeline's owner, Elektra King (Sophie Marceau),
who is the daughter of one of Renard's recent victims. Along the way, Bond
has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist, Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise
Richards), and his old rival Valentin Zukovsky (Robert Carlyle). Like all
Bond films, you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot,
since it is ridiculous beyond words. My biggest complaint would be that it
was about the most disjointed of any of the Bond films. There was at least
one point that I had to stop and try to remember why Bond was where he was
and why he was doing what he was doing. The buddy that I saw the movie with
was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of Marceau's character.
It was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in
the film. Later, it became a big part of the story and left him with the
distinct feeling that he had missed something. But because it is a Bond
film, the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about
script problems quite quickly. After all, it isn't Shakespeare.</P>
<P>How about the cast? Brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances
as 007. I grew up with the Roger Moore version of Bond, so I really enjoyed
the lighter style that Brosnan brings to the character. Judi Dench, as M,
had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the
role. She brought the talent with her that one would expect from an Oscar
winner. Robbie Coltrane was easily one of the best parts in Goldeneye, so it
was nice to see his Russian mobster character revived in this movie.
Coltrane gets more screen time, which simply leads to him stealing even more
scenes. Then there are the Bond girls. Sophie Marceau might be one of the
most beautiful actresses working today. There is just something about her
breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim.
Those that saw her in Braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face.
Marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a Bond love interest.
Then we have Denise Richards. There was no doubt in my mind that she was
cast exclusively for her looks. And after you see the outfits she wears, you
won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the
producer's eyes. I was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a
good job playing a nuclear scientist. Admittedly, there was one point that
the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue, but
other than that she stacks up (no pun intended) to her Bond girl
predecessors nicely.</P>
<P>I must say that the biggest disappointment was Robert Carlyle's character.
While Carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had, his character
just never worked for me. The producers tried very hard to add more
complexity to his character, but it just never quite got off the ground. I
guess I was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain
aspect of his character, but the writers decided to play up the emotional
side of his character. This might have worked well in another movie, but I
don't go to see Bond movies for their deep characterizations. Last, but not
least, we have Desmond Llewelyn as Q. This is the 17th appearance for
Llewelyn as Bond's gadget guy, and he is as good as ever. Although his
screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films, he is still a
treat to watch. Rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the
role. He says future appearances are up to a higher power. The producers
have introduced his protege and future replacement, a bumbling and somewhat
pompous character played by comedy master John Cleese. While we don't see
much of him in this film, I think it is fair to say that Desmond Llewelyn's
legacy, whenever it is passed on, will be in very capable hands.</P>
<P>So how does it stack up? Despite some problems, The World Is Not Enough is a
very entertaining movie. And, all things considered, what problems it does
have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier Bond movies. This
is easily the best of the Brosnan films. It may even be the best of the
entire series, certainly in the top 3. One thing is for sure, even after 19
movies, there is still plenty of life left in the James Bond series. Here's
looking forward to Bond number 20.</P>
