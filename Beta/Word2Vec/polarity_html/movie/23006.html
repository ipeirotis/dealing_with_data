<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The Iverson Ranch at Chatsworth, a movie site rented out to all studios,
was dressed up and used for the Technicolor production of RKO's Rancho
Notorious, giving the film its artificial look. Nevertheless, Lang's
Western overcame that obstacle and today is considered as one of the
strongest and the most unusual Westerns of its kind, a film that could
not be dragged down by the bickering between Lang and Dietrich during
the filming, or by the low budget ordered by Howard Hughes which kept
most of the work in the studio, or by Hughes' taking Lloyd Gough's name
off the credits because he failed to testify in the HUAC's Hollywood
witchhunt.</P>
<P>It was the first Westerns to make use of a folk ballad, which was played
at various times during the film, called Chuck-a-luck, to bolster its
theme of "hate, murder, and revenge." An old folk song in the film,
"Auralee," was later turned into the theme song of Elvis Presley's,
"Love Me Tender" (56). The film even had TV's superman, George Reeves
playing one of the bandits hiding out at Dietrich's Chuck-a-luck, a safe
haven for wanted bandits. Those who stayed at the combination ranch and
hideout were willing to pay her a ten per cent cut from their robbery
and the only rule in the place, was to ask no questions. This was a
ludicrous concept to believe, as if one expected the bandits to be
honest with her and give her the exact amount to stay, but it is fair to
say, that reality was not one of the film's strong points.</P>
<P>Vern Haskell (Kennedy) is the happiest rancher in Wyoming, he will marry
in eight days the lovely Beth Forbes (Gloria), whom he has just given a
wonderful brooch to. His happiness will be shattered when two men ride
into his small-town and one of them, Kinch (Gough), will go inside the
general store where Beth works and rob the safe, steal her brooch, rape
her, and kill her when she screams. The other man, Whitey (Doucette),
who waited outside with the horses, is upset with his partner and wants
to leave him and get his share of the robbery before they reach
Chuck-a-luck. Kinch will have none of that and shoots Whitey in the
back. But before Whitey dies, Vern, who was chasing the two before the
posse decided to chicken-out and turn back, goes on alone and catches up
with Whitey and hears his last words-- Chuck-a-luck.</P>
<P>Vern dedicates his life to catching the killer, even if it means he has
to become like him to catch him. He will get his best lead in a
barbershop, where the man getting a shave in the seat next to him,
overhears him ask the barber about Chuck-a-luck. The man tells him it is
a gunslinger's hideout run by Altar Keane (Dietrich) and he is not
supposed to ask strangers about it. The two get into a fist fight, after
the man pulls a gun on Vern, and Vern subsequently kills him and is
arrested. When Vern uses his head and tells the sheriff that he only
killed a wanted man, the sheriff confirms that it is so by looking at
wanted posters and seeing that it is Ace Maguire he killed and lets him
go, but not before telling him about a saloon in Virginia City with a
chuck-a-luck wheel and a singer named Altar who used to work there.</P>
<P>In Virginia City he hears the story of how Altar got fired and paid off
by the crooked saloon owner Baldy (Frawley), and got paid twenty dollars
which she used to wager at the chuck-a-luck wheel. She won big and with
the help of a fast-draw gunslinger, Frenchy Fairmont (Ferrer), is able
to keep her money and leave town on the stage for Silver City safely
under his protection. Baldy, embittered that since Altar left his place
business plummeted, tells Vern that he heard that Frenchy was just
arrested at a town called Gunsight.</P>
<P>Vern has become so obsessed with revenge, willing to do anything to get
the killer, that he gets himself thrown in jail by causing a disturbance
in a saloon when told he can't get a drink on election day. There are
two cells, one occupied by crooked politicians and the other by Frenchy.
Lang takes a jab at the politicians, as the jailer asks Vern which cell
he prefers and he replies, "I'd rather be with an outlaw than with a
politician, at least what they are doing is out in the open." Frenchy
and Vern are able to escape and since Vern is now a wanted man, he
brings him to Altar's place by the Mexican border.</P>
<P>Once there he notices Altar wearing the brooch he gave Beth and comes to
suspect that one of the nine men staying there as being the one that
gave that to her. It becomes a cat-and-mouse game for him, as he sweet
talks Altar, getting her to like him. He is the good man that she had
once been looking for, and will fall for him. Meanwhile, Frenchy becomes
jealous, though he continues to teach Vern  how to shoot like him. Vern
turns indistinct from the others at the ranch, even robbing a bank with
them.</P>
<P>When the cold-hearted, almost masculine-like, Altar, finally falls for
Vern, he presses her about the brooch, thinking it was Frenchy who gave
it to her. But she tells him it was Kinch and her temporary romantic
bliss is destroyed, almost like Vern's life was destroyed when he
learned what happened to Beth, as he goes into a rage, telling her he
will kill Kinch and that he has no respect for what kind of life she is
leading.</P>
<P>The final scene is a brutal one among the gang members: they have found
out that Altar snitched on Kinch. They come into Altar's ranch and pull
a gun on the bewildered Frenchy, the lifeless Altar, and the vengeful
Vern. This results in a shootout and final confrontation between Kinch
and Vern.</P>
<P>It's Lang's best and last Western, one that covers again the themes he
successfully used in his noir films, and one that makes good use of his
expressionistic style of filmmaking. The film compensates for having the
51-year-old Marlene being the sexpot in the film, a casting decision
which seems to me based more for her star power than for looking the
part, as two much younger men unbelievably fall for her. But aside from
looking old, Marlene proved she was up to the part acting-wise, giving a
mannered and brilliant performance, making this Western a legendary one.
It has a certain electricity about it that makes it special, even if
does seem a bit corny at times.</P>
