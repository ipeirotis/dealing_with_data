<PRE>THE CASTLE</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>Let's say you live at the end of an airport runway.  Large jetliners
continuously pass over your house, rattling your windows and allowing
few moments of peace.  Let's say the ground beneath your feet is also
contaminated with toxic substances, and high voltage power lines run
across steel towers only yards from your home.  Now let's say an
airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen
the runway, and offers you more than it's worth.  Wouldn't you jump in
the air and have your bags packed before you landed?  Of course you
would.</P>
<P>But what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise, and the house
your castle?  That's what they are to Darryl Kerrigan (Michael Caton),
and although he's happy that a multi-national corporation would like
to buy his home, sorry, it's not for sale.  Unfortunately, the
corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the Australian
government, which serves Darryl and his family with what amounts to an
eviction notice.  Not about to take this lying down, Darryl enlists
the help of his inept attorney friend Dennis Denuto (Tiriel Mora) and
makes a determined, albeit pathetic, attempt to fight back.</P>
<P>THE CASTLE, an Australian comedy by Rob Sitch, is perhaps one of the
simplest movies I've seen in recent memory, yet also one of the
funniest.  In fact, it is this film's reliance on simplicity which
makes it so successful.  The good guys and the bad guys are clear, the
humor is straightforward, and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it
gets.  It's the perfect setup for a relaxing, hilarious good time, and
as much as I hate to admit it, I liked the fact that I didn't have to
think all that much while watching this film.  I just sat back and
enjoyed myself.</P>
<P>The situation is one we've seen before:  Regular Joe fights back
against the government, or big business, or whatever.  What makes this
film different is its characters.  Darryl thinks he's got the best
life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power
lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind, he asks who
would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he's got
the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife Sal (Anne Tenny), and he
swells with pride when his son Dale (Stephen Curry) digs a hole in the
yard.  Steve Kerrigan (Anthony Simcoe) constantly combs the buy and
sell ads looking for "investments" like jousting sticks and overhead
projectors, while Wayne Kerrigan is in jail, as a result of Dennis
Denuto's incompetent courtroom maneuvers.  The great thing about the
Kerrigans is that they aren't so stupid that they get annoying.
They're just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly
harmless and even endearing.  We look upon them with a little bit of
pity, but a whole lot of affection.  </P>
<P>Screenwriters Sitch, Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, and Jane Kennedy pit
this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system
and a condescending business conglomerate, further polarizing the
extremes and deepening our feelings for the Kerrigans.  Sympathy for
their situation, the laughter they bring us, and the family's
wonderful characterization, simple as it may be, leaves us with a
degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about
what happens to them.  I suppose one might wonder how deep
characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the
Kerrigans, but trust me, it works.</P>
<P>I particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in
order to get laughs.  Don't get me wrong - slapstick, when executed
well, can be genius.  It's just that too often, a film will resort to
it's use as a shortcut to amusing the audience, not always
successfully.  Instead, the jokes in THE CASTLE are all hinged upon
the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are
totally skewed to the rest of the world.  When they are by themselves,
the are funny, and when they are with normal people, they are
hilarious.</P>
<P>One of the few problems I saw with this film was a detour taken about
midway though.  The Kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly
no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the
film's running time.  Luckily, it's a funny little detour that, while
slightly distracting from the film's main drive, is still quite
enjoyable.</P>
<P>With all the levity abound in THE CASTLE, the film still manages to
take on a pretty heavy concept, that of the innate right of a citizen
to keep his property, an issue which has been bandied about in courts
across the civilized world with differing outcomes.  I'm not certain
the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold
up in real life, but it brings to the forefront the essence of the
constitution (of Australia) and certainly sounds impressive at any
rate.  And, for that matter, it's more than I would have expected out
of a light hearted film like this.</P>
