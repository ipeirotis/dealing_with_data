                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Crissy Rock, Vladimir Vega.
Screenplay:  Rona Munro.
Director:  Ken Loach.</PRE>
<P>     Arriving as it does in the middle of the Newt Gingrich-generated
national discussion on the benefits of removing children from unstable
homes, LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD could not be more timely.  Although set in
England rather than the U.S., it presents a fact-based, textbook case
for the esteemed speaker's social services plan.  And while director
Ken Loach could not possibly have realized it, he has made a film which
should inspire both sides in this debate to consider their points of
view more carefully.  Harrowing, challenging yet never pedantic,
LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD is about as balanced a presentation of a difficult
issue as one could hope for, a portrait of a self-destructive woman
colliding with a by-the-book system, and brought to breathtaking life
by a knockout debut performance from Crissy Rock.</P>
<P>     Rock plays Maggie Conlon, a working-class lounge singer who
seems never to have had a break in her life.  The child of an
abusive father, she has gone on to a series of relationships which
has produced four children, all by different fathers.  Early in the
film, she meets Jorge (Vladimir Vega), a Paraguayan political
activist and a refugee from his home country, and describes in
flashback how she came to lose custody of her children to social
services.  Maggie and Jorge grow closer, and soon decide to begin a
family of their own.  However, Maggie finds it impossible to escape
from her past, and as the government continues to follow her every
move she finds her own abrasive personality making matters worse at
every turn.</P>
<P>     Director Loach, the poet laureate of the contemporary English
working class (RIFF RAFF, RAINING STONES) has delivered perhaps his
most powerful film yet with LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD.  He tells Maggie's
story in a straight-ahead fashion, eschewing cinematic hyperbole or
heavy musical cues.  It is a dramatic enough story in its own right,
and Loach knows it.  A pair of scenes in the film show two children,
one the young Maggie and the other one of Maggie's own children,
responding to witnessing an abusive father, and there is little else
Loach needs to do to demonstrate the self-perpetuating cycle
domestic violence creates.  He also trusts the audience to draw its
own conclusions from Maggie's story, and presents both Maggie and
the government social workers alternately as the solution and the
problem.  This is a story in which, ultimately, there are no
winners, and Loach refuses to let us off the hook by giving us a
convenient villain.</P>
<P>     What really makes the ambiguity work is the incendiary
performance by Crissy Rock, who had never acted before LADYBIRD.
Hard-edged and painfully low on self-esteem, Maggie repeatedly
torpedoes her own chances for happiness by refusing to believe that
she deserves any, and Rock plays this out in several incredibly
emotional scenes, every one of which feels completely honest.  She
layers Maggie's character so expertly that at times it truly does
appear that she is an unfit mother, making it hard to fault the
government's intentions.  It's powerful work by a performer who
understands instinctively that a character like this has to be real,
and Rock truly becomes Maggie.  In fact, she's so powerful that she
completely eclipses Vladimir Vega's Jorge, whose character is never
developed quite as fully as Maggie's.  There's a reason that he
sticks by her through so much hardship, but I, like Maggie, wasn't
always sure what that reason was.</P>
<P>     The screenplay by Rona Munro, though based on a true story, is
dramatically unwieldy towards the end; scenes begin to repeat
themselves, and I started to feel that I was being put through an
emotional wringer.  It's one of those cases where a bit of license
with fact might have made for a tighter and even more effective
story.  But it amounts to quibbling to fault LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD for
being too true to a gripping story.  It's a film that makes demands
of its audience, specifically to look at this story and to reach its
own conclusions about whether or not Maggie was treated fairly.  Her
story is so riveting, and so spectacularly re-created by Crissy
Rock, that any audience should be up to that challenge.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 foster children:  8.</PRE>
