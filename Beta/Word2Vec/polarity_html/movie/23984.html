<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Shekhar Kapur, an outsider from India, who admittedly knew little about
Elizabeth when assigned this film, offers his frisky but inaccurate
account of the young and fearful Elizabeth Tudor's ascension to the
throne, telling only what happened in the first five years of her reign.
The director is clearly more concerned with artful flourishes,
Elizabeth's lustfulness, and the modern ways to look upon a queen trying
to be a ruler of men, rather than exploring further the tragic and
specific drama of the times. This one's primarily a costume piece
melodrama that enjoyably emphasizes the conspiracies surrounding the
so-called Virgin Queen, who is destined to rule England's Golden Age for
some 40 years.</P>
<P>The film opens in 1554 on the last days of Bloody Mary's Catholic reign
and shows Protestants being burnt at the stake by orders of Mary (played
by Burke with spleen). The Protestant Elizabeth (played by Cate
Blanchett with ashen face and aplomb) is taken to the Tower. Elizabeth
is the half-sister to the barren Mary and is an enemy of hers because of
faith. But Mary is soon to be deceased and the crown is Elizabeth's by
1558.</P>
<P>The 25-year-old queen has to watch her back because of many foreign
conspiracies afoot,Vatican interference, the country's state of
bankruptcy, and the politically loaded marriage proposals from the
Spanish and the French. She receives full protection from the worldly
and ruthless Sir Francis Walsingham (in an underwritten role for
Geoffrey Rush), who will do anything to make sure she survives. One of
his best deeds for her, is to catch the powerful Duke of Norfolk (played
by Eccleston with proper villainy) in an act of treason, as he conspires
with the Vatican to overthrow the heretic Elizabeth, and for his effort
to exert his faith on the throne, he will be beheaded.</P>
<P>Elizabeth is full of zest, enjoying herself with her friend and lover
Lord Robert Dudley (Fiennes). She actively dances in front of the royal
court with Dudley, in a manner that is both shocking and courtly. It was
a scene that seemed out of place when compared to the rest of the film,
even though it was a striking and memorable scene.</P>
<P>Eventually, Lord Robert becomes a reminder to her of how close she came
to danger, as his loyalty to her comes into question.</P>
<P>Elizabeth is a film with a propensity for depicting spacious castles
that have dark interiors and characters who have dark intentions. The
director takes advantage of that, to take many overhead camera shots
that seem to dramatically capture the intrigues taking place, and all
the busywork being done by the Queen's attendants and her inept but
faithful adviser Sir William Cecil (Attenborough), whose chief advice is
for her to marry and become secure through an alliance. What transpires
after all the plots against Elizabeth are put down, including the
assassination of her rival in Scotland, Mary of Guise (Ardant), is that
Elizabeth is transformed from an unsure young girl, trying to rule with
a female heart, to someone who has forsaken earthly pleasures to marry
her country. She exemplifies someone who has common-sense in ruling the
country, and has forever given England one church, the Anglican church
of England, which is not beholden to Rome. It could best be said of her,
that she grew up when she learned to behave like a queen.</P>
<P>Elizabeth creates a panoramic view of 16th century England and its
intrigues. It is a film that does a better job making Elizabeth a vivid
characterization, than it does of providing unforgettable dialogue and
good storytelling. Cate Blanchett becomes Elizabeth, giving her a modern
feminist voice and a dark look inside her soul, in a daring performance
that works out rather well, considering the film was emotionally flat
and uninvolving.</P>
