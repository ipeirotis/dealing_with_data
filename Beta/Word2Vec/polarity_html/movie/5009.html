                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        DRIVING MISS DAISY takes its sweet time to tell a small, intimate
story.  It's a quiet film, a slow film, a deliberate film.  But if you're
patient with it, the movie offers innumerable rewards, such as a pair of
self-assured performances by Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy.</P>
<P>        DRIVING MISS DAISY is based on Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer-prize winning
play of the same name, which first opened in New York four years ago.  The
play has garnered international acclaim with productions in Chicago, Los
Angeles, London, Vienna, Norway, and the Soviet Union.  Uhry himself wrote
the screenplay for the film adaptation of DRIVING MISS DAISY; he also
penned the wonderful sleeper, MYSTIC PIZZA.</P>
<P>        The film, like the play, is set in Atlanta, Georgia, and it
revolves around two people in their twilight years: a cranky, 70-something
Jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man
who becomes her chauffeur.  The movie relies on character, rather than
plot, to propel the action.  In fact, the movie has no discernible plot in
the traditional sense; it doesn't present a linear story in which all the
scenes flow together.  Rather, DRIVING MISS DAISY is made up of the routine
activities of everyday life: shopping, listening to the radio, visiting the
cemetery, eating fried chicken, and so on.  The film also incorporates into
the story line actual events in Atlanta's history, including the 1958
bombing of The Temple (the city's oldest Jewish congregation) and a 1965
ceremony honoring the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</P>
<P>        The story begins in 1948 with Daisy (Tandy) crashing and wrecking
her Packard as she pulls out of her driveway.  The insurance company
cancels her insurance, and her son, Boolie, decides to hire her a
chauffeur.  Freeman, reprising his role from the play, plays the chauffeur,
Hoke.  The film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely
blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger.  DRIVING MISS
DAISY is a movie about human nature, aging, prejudice, and a great many
other things, but more than anything it's about a relationship: one that
spans 25 years, 4 cars, the advent of civil rights, and one gravely
important 33 cent can of salmon.</P>
<P>        Daisy is strong-willed and set in her ways, and, from the outset,
she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur.  Initially, she
treats Hoke with contempt, refusing to let him drive her anywhere.  Once
she does get in the car, Daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver.  To make
matters worse, she is extremely self-conscious about what others might
think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand.
Eventually, however, Daisy is worn down by Hoke's good-natured charm and
infectious cheer; she softens and opens up to him.</P>
<P>        Tandy plays the part of Daisy exceedingly well, but unfortunately
this feisty, cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace.
We've seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations, from ON
GOLDEN POND to COCOON.  Nevertheless, Tandy manages to put enough of a
personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own.</P>
<P>        Freeman, as Hoke, on the other hand, gives the more distinctive of
the two performances.  There is something profoundly moving about the way
Hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from
using public rest rooms because of his skin color.  Hoke is uneducated and
illiterate, but Freeman always suggests that there is something more to
this man, an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior.</P>
<P>        Both Freeman and Tandy seem to be in their element, in full command
of their natural charisma.  They flirt with the camera and dominate scenes
without overtly calling attention to themselves.  They bring a light touch
to their humorous banter and to the movie's gentle humor.  At the same
time, Tandy and Freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant
drama.</P>
<P>        In his first dramatic role, Dan Aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and
unexpectedly effective as Boolie, Tandy's loving and patient son.  Drama
seems to agree with Aykroyd; taking a break from comedy seems like a good
move for the actor, especially when you consider the wretched comedies he
has made recently (GHOSTBUSTERS II, THE GREAT OUTDOORS, MY STEPMOTHER IS AN
ALIEN).  The only other significant characters in the film are Daisy's
housekeeper, Idella, marvelously played by Esther Rolle ("Good Times"), and
Boolie's pretentious wife, played by Patti LuPone.</P>
<P>        Under the direction of Bruce Beresford (CRIMES OF THE HEART, TENDER
MERCIES), DRIVING MISS DAISY seems a bit stagey now and again.  But
fortunately, Beresford never forgets he's shooting a movie, and
accordingly, he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches, such as
gorgeous shots of flowers, trees, and tomatoes.</P>
<P>        In adapting DRIVING MISS DAISY from the stage to the screen, the
filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety.  Uhry understands that what
his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say.
Beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film's dramatic moments.  The
movie tugs at your heart, but it never goes for the jugular.  The only sap
in DRIVING MISS DAISY is in the trees.</P>
