<PRE>                                BEFORE SUNRISE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy.
Screenplay:  Richard Linklater and Kim Krizan.
Director:  Richard Linklater.</P>
<P>     Slacker.  Generation X.  Twenty-something.  There, now that I
have dutifully trotted out all the terms that are *supposed* to
apply to BEFORE SUNRISE, perhaps we can talk about what it really
is.  That is increasingly difficult to do with relationship-based
films about characters in their 20s, which seem to come with
generational baggage by the ton, and even harder to do when the
director of the film in question is Richard (SLACKER) Linklater.
But leave your pre-conceptions at the door, and you will be rewarded
with a nearly perfect romance, a sweet, funny and poignant character
study which, if there is any justice, will make Julie Delpy a star.</P>
<P>     BEFORE SUNRISE is the story of a chance meeting between two
people on a train in Europe.  Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is an American
touring the continent; Celine (Julie Delpy) is a French student
returning to the Sorbonne after a summer holiday.  The two strike up
a conversation which both enjoy, but which seems destined to end
when the train reaches Vienna, Jesse's destination.  Jesse, however,
has another idea:  for Celine to join him wandering through the
city while he waits for his flight back to America the next morning.
Celine agrees, and the next several hours become a whirlwind of
discussion about life, death, family and falling in love.</P>
<P>     BEFORE SUNRISE is likely to be a very polarizing kind of film,
because it consists almost entirely of conversation between Jesse
and Celine.  There is a certain segment of the viewing public which
will be driven to distracion by such a structure, and they should do
themselves a favor and avoid it.  I could argue with these
individuals all day, and not convince them to see what I saw in
BEFORE SUNRISE:  two complex characters developing as genuine a
relationship as you could hope to see on the screen.  Linklater and
co-screenwriter Kim Krizan allow Jesse and Celine to unfold slowly,
so that the characters we think we have figured out early in the
film turn out to be something very different by the end.  Jesse at
first appears to be carefree and confident, but as he lets his guard
down he displays a deeply rooted cynicism and insecurity; Celine,
whose early discussions focus on death and her very practical
parents, becomes someone torn between the romantic she wants to be
and the pragmatist she feels obliged to be.  Even in isolation, I
found getting to know these characters fascinating.</P>
<P>     Together, I found them even more remarkable.  Ethan Hawke and
Julie Delpy both deliver marvelous performances, developing an
affection and connection which always seems absolutely real.  Some
of their tentative early scenes were so perfect that I had to look
away, particularly a hilariously uncomfortable moment in a record
store listening booth where they refuse to make eye contact.  While
both are impressive, it is Delpy who commands the camera's
attention; every reaction is on target, and every line seems
spontaneous.  It is difficult to choose one moment in her
performance above the others, but one will linger in my memory:  the
look of giddy uncertainty on her face when she steps off of the
train in Vienna.  In that one look, Delpy says as much about what
this film is about--the risk of romance--than all the dialogue.</P>
<P>     I keep returning to certain terms when thinking about and
describing BEFORE SUNRISE--perfect, genuine, real.  If that is so,
it is because I have seen film after film over the past few years
try to pass itself off as a romance without demonstrating the most
cursory understanding about the way a real relationship develops.
Linklater does so many things right, but I would like to bring
attention to things he *doesn't* do.  He doesn't wait until the
final reel for Jesse and Celine to kiss, accompanied by a full
orchestra; he doesn't manufacture pointless conflict; and most
astonishingly, he doesn't ever have them say "I love you."  BEFORE
SUNRISE is about a single night which will become a perfect memory,
and I am beginning to believe that is what the film will become for
me.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Rohmers in the night:  10.</PRE>
