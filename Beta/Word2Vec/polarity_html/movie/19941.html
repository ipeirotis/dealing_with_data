Gerardi/Ennio Guarnieri/Klaus Köni; cast: Jon Voight (Walter Thschanz),

<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An existential mystery story about someone getting away with murder some
30 years ago, when the now police commissioner Hans Barlach (Ritt) and
the now wealthy and well-connected businessman, Richard Gastmann (Shaw),
were young men and Gastmann made a bet with Barlach that he could kill
someone and get away with it. He seemingly punched a girl named Nadine
they were both romantically interested in and she fell in the water to
drown.</P>
<P>At present, in Berne, Switzerland, where Walter Thschanz (Voight) is
called back from his vacation to help the dying police commissioner
solve the murder of a policeman (played by Donald Sutherland) who was
working undercover, on a special assignment for the commissioner, to spy
on Gastmann at his country estate. Barlach, in the meantime, is most
concerned with his stomach trouble and will have to undergo an operation
in a few days just so he can live for another year. So he tells the
aggressive and ambituous Walter to take charge of the case.</P>
<P>Barlach's grumpy demeanor, the strange circumstances of the case, and
the unsettling Swiss countryside, add a noir feel to this B & W film.
Barlach's guilt over the ridiculous wager he made as a young man lingers
on with him; it was a time, he reflects, when he does something immature
he would never do at a different stage in his life.</P>
<P>The murdered policeman is found with a bullet through his head while he
is slumped down on the seat of his car. He had just left the home of
Gastmann as an invited guest to one of his parties, where he assumed the
role of a history professor, in which he fooled no one at Gastmann's.
There he was able to gain access to Gastmann and meet romantically
Gastmann's attractive mistress, Anna (Bisset).</P>
<P>When snooping around Gastmann's premises, his South African dog attacks
Barlach and Walter has to fire a shot killing the dog. The wily Barlach
has things all sorted out from here on in-- as the story becomes a chess
game, with a surprise ending and much questioning about matters of guilt
and innocence.</P>
<P>Martin Ritt, who is usually a film director, plays his part with all the
right quirks and nuances to make his role quite interesting. He reminded
me a lot of Peter Falk's Columbo. Voight is a good counterbalance to
Ritt and to Robert Shaw's one-dimensional Nazi-like villain role. He is
able to bring an energy into the investigation, something that makes the
implausible situation seem a little bit more plausible. But the ending,
when all the game plans come together, left me slightly irked-- this
easy to watch film, just didn't add up. It seemed as if the story tried
too hard to make sure that man's sense of justice won't be mocked
anymore, and I just couldn't buy into its easy solution, especially when
for most of the film, confusion was the telling story.</P>
