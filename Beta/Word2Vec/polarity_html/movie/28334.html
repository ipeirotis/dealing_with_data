<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It's a gritty cop movie when the two protagonists are inarticulate and
are trying to form a relationship to ease their inner pain. They have
both lost their families in one way or another. Their romance is quirky
and seems to be stumbling around to get someplace. Unfortunately, when
they do become articulate and mesh together, the film moves into the
predictable formulaic mold and ends in a cornball way. They were both
more endearing when they had nothing to say, where one would constantly
be asking the other: "Who are you?"</P>
<P>Sharon Pogue (Jennifer Lopez) is a tough Chicago policewoman, who in the
opening scene comforts a critically injured man who has been in a
terrible car accident. She is soon shown in action making an arrest on a
nasty thug by using a body-slam to make sure she gets the pinch. Her
physical prowess in that incident would make make even the most macho
policeman feel proud. Relaxing in a bar she trades sexual innuendoes
with her compatriots on the police force, and smoothly handles her
married partner Robby's (Terrence Howard) sexually playful attempts to
come onto her. She shows her vulnerable side at night, after being wound
up too tight fighting crime in the street all day, suffering from her
loneliness and from her insomnia. She's also poisoned by the fact that
she had to arrest ten years ago her abusive father (Argo), who used her
mother (Braga) as a punching bag. The arrest stopped the abuse, but she
took all the heat for embarrassing the family. Her father has refused to
talk to her since then, and mom only wishes she wouldn't have arrested
her father. She now finds out from her construction worker brother that
her mother and father plan to renew their wedding vows.</P>
<P>The recovered accident victim goes by the handle Catch (Jim Caviezel).
He is a timid, quivering man, who does nothing but walk the city streets
in his overcoat and tries to do angelic things for the strangers he
encounters. He shuts off a guy's headlights on his parked car, returns
his next door neighbor's keys she left in the door, and takes in a stray
dog. For his mother-in-law (Knight), who is disabled in a wheelchair, he
does the weekly grocery shopping and uses her as his surrogate mother.
He has a ghostlike appearance and seems to be disengaged from the world.</P>
<P>When Sharon is faced with a thug standing with a gun over her slumped
body after a police chase, Catch jumps him and saves her life. The two
get together in the bar where her cop friends hangout and neither one
recognizes the other from the car accident a year ago, though Catch
feels a strange connection to her. He thinks they were destined to meet.
Even though Catch seems like a freak show, Sharon feels something about
him that she doesn't from the other guys she goes out with. They develop
a relationship filled with the secret pains they have, but are unable to
communicate with each other because their hurt is so deep. His pain is
that he can't live with himself because his wife and kid were killed in
the accident. Her pain is that she is not appreciated by her family;
they have made her an outsider. When she goes to her brother's house
after he punches his wife around, they react poorly to her intervention.
Spousal abuse seems to have a history of being passed onto different
generations of the same family, as is evidenced here.</P>
<P>JLo is a convincing cop and one tough broad, but who has a soft side to
her behind her bullet proof vest. Jim Caviezel looks as if he arrived
from another world; he's disheveled and lives in his sparsely decorated
apartment featuring only a bed, a telephone with an answering machine,
and a drawer filled with children's toys. He seemed believable as
someone who has been traumatized, and begins to recover when it is
revealed that he's a former jazz trumpeter. As for their hot moments
together JLo is a natural for sex, but Caviezel seemed too distant to
really be getting into it. But the film can almost be forgiven for its
sore points in storytelling, because these two star performers bring
something to the screen that is curiously arresting. The problem with
the film is that the filmmaker couldn't let their romance play out in a
natural way. Filmmaker Luis Mandoki ("Message in a Bottle") could think
of no other way to bring them together than by having Caviezel go
through a corny soliloquy at his wife's graveside; while, JLo saved her
corny soliloquy for a videocam message to her father at the family
reception. To make matters seem more artificial there is some loud,
syrupy music before the film ends and the credits roll by, as JLo and
Caviezel drive off together seemingly having survived their personal
tragedies with some big fake smiles on their faces. I wonder how many
market research reports it took for them to come up with that happy
ending!</P>
