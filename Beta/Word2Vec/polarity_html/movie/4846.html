<P>     Mike Nichols, the director of such well-received films as THE 
GRADUATE and WORKING GIRL, has taken the outrageous 1978 French farce, 
LA CAGE AUX FOLLES, and, by tweaking, updating, and Americanizing it, 
come up with a huge winner.  THE BIRDCAGE, as it's called, is one of 
those rare motion pictures with side-splitting laughs where the humor 
never stays dormant for long.  Using the talents of choreographers and 
set designers who don't know the meaning of "moderation", this movie is 
a triumph of the stylistically absurd.</P>
<P>     This is the third "big" cross-dressing movie to reach American 
screens in as many years (the other two being THE ADVENTURES OF 
PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT and TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING! 
JULIE NEWMAR), and the first to have a short title.  But, as flashy and 
splashy as the man-dressed-as-a-woman scenario can be, THE BIRDCAGE 
(like PRISCILLA) is as much about being gay as it is about 
transvestitism, and it advances a message of equality, love, and 
acceptance.  "We Are Family" isn't just the film's opening number; it's 
the theme song.</P>
<P>     For some twenty years, Armand (Robin Williams) and Albert (Nathan 
Lane) have lived together as husband and wife (so to speak).  Both are 
openly gay, and comfortable with their sexuality.  They are partners in 
business as well as out of it -- Armand operates a drag nightclub where 
Albert is the star performer.  They have a son, Val (Dan Futterman), the 
product of Armand's one-night tryst twenty-one years ago with big-time 
executive Katherine Archer (Christine Baranski).  As far as his 
upbringing is concerned, Val is as much Albert's son as Armand's, and 
he's not ashamed of his unusual family situation -- at least not in the 
normal course of things.</P>
<P>     But things are no longer normal.  Val is engaged to the 18-year old 
daughter of Senator Keeley (Gene Hackman), the co-founder of the 
Coalition for Moral Order who believes that Billy Graham is too liberal.  
Since there's no way that Keeley would sanction a marriage between his 
daughter and the son of a gay couple, Val pleads with his father to 
pretend to be straight, if only for one night.  The result of this, as 
might be expected, is a hilarious disaster.</P>
<P>     Although most of the jokes come from Elaine May's screenplay, it's 
the performances that make them funny.  Robin Williams, despite his 
reputation for unfettered mania, is surprisingly restrained throughout 
most of THE BIRDCAGE, doing a little serious acting along the way.  
Nathan Lane, playing the effeminate Albert, is the real star, whether 
he's trying to swagger like John Wayne (to act manly) or costumed like a 
housewife.  Williams and Lane work well as a couple, feeding off one 
another in the fashion of all great comedy twosomes.</P>
<P>     Gene Hackman has the straight man's role, and he fits into it 
wonderfully.  His antics to escape reporters and his reaction to Val's 
parents are two of the film's comic highlights.  Dianne Wiest, Dan 
Fullerman, Calista Flockhart (as Val's fiancee, Barbara), and Christine 
Baranski all turn in solid supporting performances.  The only one who's 
too over-the-top is Hank Azania as Armand and Albert's houseboy, 
Aggedor.  His exaggerated mannerisms are frequently as irritating as 
they are amusing.  </P>
<P>     THE BIRDCAGE rivals A MIDWINTER'S TALE for the funniest movie 
released thus far in 1996.  In fact, the film is so boisterously 
entertaining that it's easy for the unsuspecting viewer not to realize 
that there's a message here.  The structure of THE BIRDCAGE is designed 
to show us that there isn't much difference between conservatives and 
liberals or straight and gay people.  Nichols' picture preaches 
tolerance and understanding, but neatly camouflages such themes beneath 
gaudy sets, colorful costumes, and unrestrained humor.  The script has a 
few lulls, and there are times when it doesn't make a lot of sense, but 
there are few better ways to spend a chilly winter evening than peering 
through the bars of THE BIRDCAGE.</P>
