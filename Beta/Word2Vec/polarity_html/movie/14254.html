<P>Dear God, this is a fantastically bad film!  Regardless of what I say
about Knock Off, you can't grasp its awfulness from my words.  You have
to see it and experience it for yourself.  Here's the kicker, though --
I suggest that you do so.  Yes, this is a bad film -- easily one of the
most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided
charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure.  In fact, I
enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time, despite the dreadful
acting and a completely incomprehensible story.  </P>
<P>Don't get me wrong:  I'm not excusing Knock Off.  It reaches an
unacceptable level of badness; it's so incoherent that I wonder if it
was hacked up worse than The Avengers was.  It also features some truly
terrible performances from Lela Rochon, Michael Wong, Paul Sorvino, and
-- of course -- Jean-Claude Van Damme.  It does, however, have the
entertaining presence of Rob Schneider, and the excessively inventive
and pretentious direction of Tsui Hark.  As I watched it, I occasionally
wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness.  Now, in retrospect, it
seems clear that it wasn't, but it's still a fascinating kind of mess.</P>
<P>I don't like writing plot descriptions (it is, by far, the most boring
part of writing a review), but, in this case, I'm off the hook:  there
is no way I could write an accurate synopsis for Knock Off.  For the
sake of comparison, I had no trouble understanding The Usual Suspects
during my first viewing.  I paid closer attention to Knock Off, and the
only thing I am able to say about it is that Van Damme plays a dude
named Ray, and is accused by the CIA (I think) of selling knock off
products (knock off products are, of course, products that look like
name-brand materials but are generic and cheap).</P>
<P>I don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts, but there
are lots of martial arts in the film.  Ray is good at martial arts, so
when he has to beat up bad guys, there's no problem.  Rob Schneider
plays his sidekick, although I had no idea who he really was by the end
of the film.  Lela Rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff,
while Paul Sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once!  In
fact, every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that
the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do. 
In that order, Knock Off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely
no sense.</P>
<P>But what a strange mess it is.  It was written by Stephen E. De Souza,
who also wrote Die Hard and 48 Hours.  Can this be the same man?  I
don't see how, unless, of course, huge chunks of the film have been
removed for the sake of running time.  Knock Off seems to have an
interesting premise (as far as action films go), but there's no
semblance here.  For instance, Van Damme is introduced, and then seconds
later he's running a chariot race through the streets of Hong Kong. 
Why?  Who knows.  What are the implications of this?  I have no idea.</P>
<P>Most action films abandon depth in favor of action, and this is
normally a problem.  Knock Off, however, is the first film that I would
have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut.  The acting
is embarrassingly bad:  Rochon, in particular, delivers each of her
lines with stiff and talentless insincerity.  Sorvino, in addition,
deserves better than this.  Van Damme is bad, but he's charming in that
bad way, and so I can't say that he's hard to watch (although I rarely
understood what he was saying).  The only exception is Rob Schneider,
who is actually quite funny a lot of the time.</P>
<P>Tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes John Woo look tame by
comparison.  They're all pointless gimmicks though, such as shots of the
inner-workings of a knock off running shoe.  But his action scenes are
never boring:  one particular piece inside of a fruit factory (a fruit
factory?) is well-choreographed.  Lots of the scenes are pitched well to
comedy, such as our heroes' first encounter with the Rochon character. 
But did Tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous?  I hope he did, for
the alternative is a frightening thought.</P>
<P>Knock Off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania.  If
it were boring, I'd give it zero stars.  But it's not boring:  it's loud
and excessive and completely incoherent.  It's also funny, even when it
isn't meaning to be funny.  A bad film that succeeds as entertainment
doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted.  I recognize Knock Off for its
irrefutable badness, but I can't deny it's zany, useless charm.  Oh, I
know, they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story,
but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane
concepts.  It's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this, but
that doesn't excuse the fact that it is, indeed, awful.</P>
