<PRE>                                BULLETPROOF HEART
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     The chief problem with Mark Malone's stylish BULLETPROOF HEART is 
the schism between plot and dialogue -- one is (supposedly) thoughtful 
and meditative, the other is pulpy.  It's the sort of thing you might 
expect if Raymond Chandler wrote an existential novel or if Chekhov 
tried his hand at a story about a hit man.  Over the course of the 
movie's ninety-eight minute running time, we get the toughest assassin 
in New York mulling over the question "What's the meaning of meaning?" 
while brandishing a gun.  Despite the apparent thematic relationship 
with the closing scenes of PULP FICTION, BULLETPROOF HEART is distinctly 
inferior. </P>
<P>     Anthony LaPaglia plays the murderous Mick, one of the best in the 
business.  This is the story of a bizarre and disastrous night in his 
life.  First, his best friend and ex-partner Archie (Matt Craven) 
arrives from Florida, begging forgiveness for a past screw-up and asking 
for a second chance.  Then Mick's regular client George (Peter Boyle) 
shows up with a job:  a beautiful woman (Mimi Rogers) in debt for more 
than $1 million has to be taken out.  The twist is that she knows what's 
coming and actually welcomes it.  And the problem for Mick is that after 
spending a short time with Fiona, he falls for her. (Anyone remember 
Forrest Whitaker and Sherilyn Fenn in DIARY OF A HITMAN?) </P>
<P>     Vaguely echoing Daniel Auteuil's male lead from UN COEUR EN HIVER 
(in both appearance and demeanor), Mick is as emotionally repressed as 
they come -- even a sensuous call girl can't elicit more than a "who 
cares?" reaction.  Then enter the seductive, distraught Fiona, and 
Mick's emotions come rushing out like an uncapped geyser.  BULLETPROOF 
HEART certainly isn't an original exploration of feelings and issues, 
but there are a few moments of genuine impact.  Unfortunately, these 
tend to be cut short by silly dialogue and so-so acting.  Mimi Rogers is 
appealing and Matt Craven is hilarious, by Anthony LaPaglia has 
difficulty convincing the audience that his entire life has undergone a 
radical transformation.  Only towards the very end do we get a sense of 
what all this means to Mick, but then it's a little too late. </P>
<P>     By too frequently straying into the cliched realm of the noir 
thriller instead of really plumbing the emotionally-wrenching situation 
of a man forced to kill the woman he loves, BULLETPROOF HEART loses 
momentum.  The ending is telegraphed far in advance and several scenes 
seem overplotted and mechanical.  Fiona is supposed to die before 
sunrise, but as the morning approaches, the film bogs down.   </P>
<P>     Perhaps director Mark Malone was too ambitious, trying to merge 
Shakespearean tragedy, dime novel themes, and comedy into one.  Strip 
away all the trappings, and this is essentially about the reviving power 
of love.  The premise is intriguing, and the romance between Mick and 
Fiona is often as fascinating as it should be, but BULLETPROOF HEART is 
crammed with nonsensical and pointless elements that severely curb the 
film's effectiveness.  In the final analysis, I liked this film far less 
than I wanted to. </P>
