<P>HANDS ON A HARD BODY(director: S.R. Bindler; cinematographers:
Bindler/Michael Nickles/Chapin Wilson; 1997)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>If you want a brand new $15,000 Hard Body blue Nissan pickup for free,
you might consider entering a contest from an auto dealership in
Longview, Texas, taking place every spring, where contestants are chosen
from a lottery. In this filmed 1995 contest, where there were 24
contestants, the winner of the pickup will be the last one standing
upright, no leaning or squatting allowed, with the winner having at
least one gloved hand (the glove is to avoid any scratches) on the
truck.</P>
<P>The other rules of the contest include a mandatory drug test when the
contest gets down to three people. A second prize of $250 and a third
prize of a gift certificate at a local store, to appease the contestants
who have gone so far but failed. There are 5-minute breaks every hour
and after 6- hours there is a 15-minute break.</P>
<P>The dealership's crude advertising gimmick, seemingly exploits the
blue-collar type of participants undergoing this lunacy, who will go
without sleep for days and will battle exhaustion, the heat, and the
mosquitoes. This makes for a different type of documentary, one with a
less serious tone than most others but one that is fun to watch, as the
varied contestants of different ages, sizes, genders, and races, each
have their idea on what it takes for them to win. The thing they have
most in common, is that they want the truck, the question is how much do
they want it.</P>
<P>A previous winner, the cowboy sage, Benny Perkins, who went for some 80+
hours without sleep to win his truck two- years ago, offers his view on
what it takes to win this endurance test in an interview shot before the
contest began and was shown throughout the contest, of which he was
again an entrant, and was considered the favorite because of his
previous experience. He contends that it is mental toughness that is
required and maturity, and knowing how to get comfotable and eat light
food during the breaks. He doubts if anyone under 30 will win, unless he
is a former marine with that disciplined mind-set. He calls this event a
human drama thing, rather than a contest.</P>
<P>Bindler's camera crew was there night and day to chronicle the event,
along with voluntary judges and family and friends cheering on the
contestants, as the documentary became about why and how the
participants entered the contest and why they are still in it. Bindler
is a native of that Texas city, though the 29-year-old went away to
study at New York University film school, but returned to film the event
he recalled as something he thought was absurd but didn't know what else
to make of it.</P>
<P>Some of the contestants who were singled out for interviews, were the
one's whose personalities stood out, whom we saw at different hours and
in different frames of mood and in alternating physical conditions.</P>
<P>Norma is an obese Hispanic woman, who is a fervant Christian. She
believes God wants her to win the truck and she has a prayer group of
some two hundred members from her church praying for her to win. To keep
alert, she listens to gospel music on her radio headphones and sometimes
goes into fits of joyous laughter to keep her spirits up. Russell Welsh
needs to get a truck to replace his other one after a tough year. Kelly
Mangrum is an attractive student, who wants braces and will sell the
truck to meet some of her other expenses. Greg is an ex-marine, who
believes he has the youth and physical stamina to win. Janis is
distinctively missing a few front teeth and says she always finishes
what she starts. Ronald is a black country boy, who says he will fast
for three days but is seen eating snickers during the breaks. He wishes
there was no tent over his head because he loves the heat and he thinks
the tent helps the others more than it does him. J.D. Drew is the oldest
contestant and is an avid deer hunter, who described how he stood
patiently for long periods to get his prey. Angie learns that she didn't
prepare properly for the contest and quits when she becomes
disorientated, saying she doesn't think she would ever do it again, but
she comes back next year and wins. Paul Prince feels he is in great
condition and thinks he can go the distance. Raul thinks he has what it
takes to win and is seen getting a foot massage from his girlfriend.</P>
<P>What is magnanimous about the documentary, was that even though it could
have gone for the cheap joke and made fun of these people, instead it
takes them seriously and let's them explain in their own way why they
are there. The filmmaker clearly saw that what the contestants were
doing was fantastic and out of the ordinary already, so there was no
need to embellish the story, and by keeping it simple, he succeeded in
telling their story honestly and in a very human way. These real people
happened to also be likable people, manifesting real concerns and
problems, and when people start dropping out, you can see a camaraderie
growing between some of these strangers (others remain critical of their
competitors). But, despite the competitiveness of the event, most of
them realize that they were all put through some ordeal, and they went
through it together and therefore shared the trip and learned something
about human values. The result is a quirky, non-dramatic, human interest
story about the need for Texans to drive a pickup, as if it was their
God given right to have one. And as Benny said, "It is something to see
people struggling to get what you want. But, at least, they tried.
People don't want to take a risk, anymore, they are afraid that if they
fail, they will get hurt." I'll buy that. It's worth a look, reminding
me a little bit of that Sydney Pollack film "They Shoot Horses, Don't
They," but without the cheap sentimentality Pollack threw into his film.
It played, for me, more like a sports story that ESPN 2 would air, where
the filmmaker didn't know who was going to win and many times focused on
those who unexpectedly dropped out, and part of the lure of the film was
choosing who you think will win.</P>
