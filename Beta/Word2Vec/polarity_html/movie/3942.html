<PRE>                                 KIDS
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     KIDS is a film by first time director Larry Clark about a group of kids
from about 10 to 15 years in age.  They are a culturally diverse group of
boys and girls who share a common trait, they represent a good parent's
worst nightmare and they have zero moral values.  Let me warn you upfront
that as a parent, watching this show was about as enjoyable as having
boiling oil poured over my body.  Non-parents may be able to view the movie
more dispassionately and give it higher marks.  On the other hand, the
people who should probably see KIDS are parents, especially poor to mediocre
ones.  Having thus been forewarned, let me continue with the review.</P>
<P>     KIDS tells the story of Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) and Jennie (Chloe
Sevigny), and their friends Ruby (Rosario Dawson), Harold (Harold Hunter),
Darcy (Yakira Peguero), Casper (Justin Pierce), and many others.  Telly
spends all of his waking hours plotting ways to seduce very young girls into
having sex for the first time.  When he is not busying doing this, he and
his friends are drinking malt liquor, doing drugs, stealing things, trashing
houses, lying constantly, and demonstrating all of the traits associated
with what was known as hoodlum behavior in a more genteel age.</P>
<P>     Although the script by Harmony Korine does not show any of the kids as
having positive attributes, it does portray the girls as sort of willing
victims.  Given that statistics show that teenage mothers have typically had
liaisons with men in their early 20s, this depiction of girl as victim may
not be inaccurate.  In this movie, the kids were painted in degrees of evil,
but the worst were the boys.  A set of frightening images all around.  The
most graphic horror movies are nothing compared to KIDS.</P>
<P>     Although the filming does not have the hand held camera instability of
a documentary, overall, the script and especially the low quality of the
acting makes you think you are watching a poor documentary of an extremely
important subject.  I read the director had the kids ad lib a lot.  The
picture feels as if they cast them all in a single day on the street and
told the kids to just act natural.  I suspect it was more organized than
that, but it feels pretty amateurish.  The depressing and filthy sets add to
its documentary feel.</P>
<P>     The boys and the girls in the movie are obsessed with sex.  They talk
about it constantly, and do it when not busy with drinking, getting stoned
and passing out, or other such activities.  They all act as if they had
fried their brains with drinking and drugs years ago and thereby reduced
their IQ levels to under 80.  Low mumbling and foul language is the way they
communicate.  You may wish many of the scenes were subtitled.</P>
<P>     Most of the movie is about Jennie and her quest for Telly after she
finds he got her HIV positive with her only sexual encounter ever.  The
movie totally ignores the possibility of teen pregnancy and of getting
thrown in jail, yet has a girl get AIDS with a single incident.  The
relative likelihood of the problems were totally out of proportion.</P>
<P>     KIDS runs 1:30, and I saw every painful minute of it, but wish I
hadn't.  It is unrated because the MPAA board was going to give it an NC-17
and since the producer wanted kids to be able to see KIDS, he released it as
unrated instead.  There is no way I would let a kid see this show.  It is
perhaps useful material for adults but could be misinterpreted by kids.  On
the other hand, most of the people in the audience I was at seemed to be
about 18.  I wondered what they thought of it.  Beside all of the horror
mentioned above, it has extreme violence which is treated as nothing by the
kids in the movie.  So we may have killed someone; so what.  One of the
kids, I think Casper, sums the kids' philosophy when he says "when you are
young, not much matters".  I can not actually recommend this show that makes
Kafka look like an optimist, but if you do go, you may gain some insights,
depressing as the film may be.  I award KIDS ** for risk taking and chilling
realism.  Were I not a parent, perhaps I might have been able to view it
more charitably and give another half star or so.</P>
<PRE>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
