<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A thrilling but shamelessly manipulative political thriller, the second
feature dealing with presidential politics from the director who was
once a film critic, Rod Lurie (Deterrence). He has vastly honed his
skills as a filmmaker in comparison with his debut film, which was a
failure artistically and commercially.</P>
<P>"The Contender" is a film that is grounded in having a clear
understanding of how politically underhanded and sly the system is and
how those in it operate on a level that would make Machiavelli proud of
them.</P>
<P>I was taken aback by how great the entire ensemble cast is, with the
leads being superb in getting the maximum out of their juicy roles, even
if they have to chew the scenery to do it. The cast is so good that it
overcomes the shrill oratory, the manipulative, obvious and unbelievable
political situations, and an ending that tries to play it so safe, that
it takes away the juice in the story that gave this film its power in
the first place. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though I knew it was a
manipulative film, trying to get me to bite at its revelations about the
double-standards between men and women politicians, without giving me a
fair chance to swallow everything without choking on what I was asked to
swallow.</P>
<P>The film opens as President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges), a Bill Clinton
type, is shown to be a politically savvy politician, more interested in
working his political skills than he is in standing up for his issues.
The film's running gag being that he's a glutton for food, which he
spends more time at than on anything else, trying to test the White
House kitchen staff by ordering exotic foods to see if he can catch them
empty- handed. This only occurs when he orders something ordinary -- a
Muenster cheese sandwich.</P>
<P>Due to the sudden death of the current VP, President Evans has to pick
someone to fill the vacancy. The leading contender for the post is the
ambitious governor of Virginia, Jack Hathaway (William Petersen), a
loyal Democrat and a noted patriot, who is egged on to be more assertive
by his shrewish wife (Kristen Shaw). He becomes a hero in one of the
opening scenes, even though the woman he tried to save dies anyway. The
accident occurred while he is on a fishing trip with a reporter and a
car plunges off a bridge and an attractive woman drowns, but not before
Hathaway bravely jumps into the water amid the reporter's shouts of you
don't have to do it and risks his life trying to save her. There was
something about that action that didn't seem right. It will later on
play an important part in the film's plot.</P>
<P>The President's choice for vice president is Laine Hanson (Joan Allen),
an Ohio senator and a daughter of a former Republican governor. She is
pro-choice, an atheist who recently switched parties from Republican to
Democrat, and is an articulate, poised, and attractive candidate. She is
divorced and currently married to her former campaign manager (Robin
Thomas), and is the mother of a 6-year-old boy. The President taps her
for the job because he wants to leave a legacy that he was the one who
chose the first woman to hold that office.</P>
<P>In an interesting scene, she consults with her father (Philip Baker
Hall) for his approval and advice, realizing that she will have a fight
on her hands from the disappointed Hathaway. It also becomes apparent
that she's a woman who enjoys sex. She receives the President's phone
call, offering her the position, when she is in the middle of having sex
with her husband. The film pulls no punches about her being active
sexually. It makes the viewer face the fact that a woman in high office
is still a woman and has to be accepted just like a man in that position
would be.</P>
<P>The heart of the film is the fight over her confirmation and all the
backroom manuevering to get her the job. She faces opposition from
Sheldon Runyon (Gary Oldman), the powerful McCarthyite-like congressman
who will chair the confirmation hearings. Runyon is opposed to Hanson's
nomination because he wants to get even with the President for some
other political battles they had and because he doesn't like her or her
views. He finds ammunition for his opposition when he runs a private
investigation on her, ala Starr, and finds evidence that when she was in
college pledging for a sorority, she was allegedly having sex with two
boys at a fraternity house as part of the initiation. He comes armed
with photos of her in action and eyewitnesses. He even leaks the story
to the Internet, which posts the pictures so that television and the
tabloids can pick it up. Hanson refuses to comment on the issue, taking
the high moral ground, saying it is no one's business but her own.</P>
<P>A sidebar to the story is about a 28-year-old freshman congressman from
the small state of Delaware, Reginald Webster (Slater), who worms his
way onto Runyon's powerful committteee by promising to support him 100
percent. He is supposed to be a young Bill Clinton-type, first starting
his climb to the top. When he sees the sleazy direction
the confirmation hearings are going in and when called into the
President's office to be bullied by him, he is overawed by the power of
the office, and he begins to have some pangs of conscience. The
President is shown as being figuratively and literally a shark-eater, as
he is eating a shark sandwich when conferring with Webster.</P>
<P>Senator Hanson is seen as both a liberal and a vegetarian. This is
underscored when she has a courtesy luncheon date about her confirmation
with the steak eating right-wing chairman Runyon and orders a spicy
pasta dish, despite his insistence that she better eat voraciously like
he does if she wants to get power in Washington.</P>
<P>The story in itself is more soap opera than drama, but what gives it
verve is the super performances from the three stars, Jeff Bridges, Gary
Oldman, and Joan Allen. They give depth to their roles and they are all
seen in many different lights and shades. Jeff Bridges steals every
scene he is in, offering a fascinating look at a president who could be
likable though sinister, sneakily clever, and also very politically
human in a generous and gracious way. He was thoroughly believable as an
updated Bill Clinton-type, post-Lewinsky.</P>
<P>In a supporting role, as an advisor to the President, Kermit Newman (Sam
Elliott), makes his presence felt in a very forceful performance as the
political realist who has the President's ear but knows when to stop
giving advice and follow his leader.</P>
<P>This film is a pro-Clinton one, taking aim at those who dig up dirt and
cast aspersions in a hypocritical way, when it is evident that both
sides are capable of using the same bag of dirty tricks to further their
own cause. The film was fascinating when it didn't have a message to
deliver with some bogus pat speech and, instead, set up a logical
argument showing that Senator Hanson should be confirmed for office
despite allegations of her youthful sex scandal.</P>
