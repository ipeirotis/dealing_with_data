<PRE>SHADOW MAGIC
A film review by Steve Rhodes

RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"There are mountains behind the mountains," remarks one of the viewers 
of the first motion picture to be shown in Peking.  The images show a 
Western world that is indeed far behind and beyond the Chinese mountain 
ranges.  With the eager help of young photographer Liu Jinlun (Xia Yu), 
Englishman Raymond Wallace (Jared Harris), an artistic P.T. Barnum-type 
character, opens a "Shadow Magic" extravaganza to display his 
combination of home movies and English travelogue.  Soon these two 
entrepreneurs are packing them into the old warehouse that serves as 
their picture palace.</P>
<P>Set amidst the turmoil of a changing era as China reluctantly welcomes 
the twentieth century, SHADOW MAGIC, which was "inspired by a true 
story," is a good-spirited movie written and directed by Ann Hu.  A 
stunningly gorgeous costume drama, the movie suffers from its nearly two 
hour length and its threadbare scripting.  The lushness of Nancy 
Schreiber's cinematography almost makes up for the thinness of the 
characterizations.  Liu, the central character, has a large, silly grin 
plastered on his face through most of the movie.  When Liu runs into 
trouble, it's hard to empathize with him since he is such a stick 
figure.  Raymond isn't much better.  He's the classic dreamer whose wife 
left him for another man, which is easy to understand.</P>
<P>What really works in the movie, other than the authentic and nostalgic 
sets, is the wonderment of seeing a new technology so entrance a 
populace.  The movie effectively reminds us how revolutionary some of 
today's gadgets were just a century ago.  The world changes more rapidly 
than we would ever believe.  "They say the time will come when men will 
cut off their pigtails and women will unbind their feet," Liu tells his 
photography studio employer, Master Ren (Lu Liping), who finds it quite 
hard to believe.</P>
<P>SHADOW MAGIC runs 1:55.  The film is in Mandarin with English subtitles 
and in English.  It is rated PG for brief mild language and would be 
acceptable for kids old enough to read subtitles.</P>
