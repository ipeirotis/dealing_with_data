<PRE>Blade
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Wesley Snipes; Stephen Dorff; Kris Kristofferson; N'Bushe Wright &
Donal Logue</P>
<P>Blade is the movie that shows that Wesley Snipes really can live up to his
potential as one of Hollywood's premier leading men. Blade is based on the
comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel
to it. It is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works
very well. Although, at a few points I thought I was watching a music video
as opposed to a movie. The ideas behind Blade are good, as is the basic plot
of the story. But at times, things seem to get a bit muddled, and the
writers appear to want to do too many things at once. That really doesn't
take away from the story too much, but it does hurt it a little bit.</P>
<P>Blade (Snipes) is half man, half vampire. His mother was bitten by a vampire
when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic
traits of a vampire. Including a thirst for human blood that must be kept
under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust. Blade has
spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for
the fact that one of their kind killed his mother. But this isn't as easy as
it seems, because the vampires in Blade's world are more sophisticated than
the ones that you find in most films. The government and other authorities
know of the existence of vampires, but they let them feast of the population
at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires. Where do vampires
get money? Well, in Blade, they run multinational companies in order to
finance their vampire organizations. I personally thought that this whole
secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea, and a great
addition to the movie. Blade runs up against the evil Deacon Frost (Stephen
Dorff) a maverick in the vampire community. He isn't content to live among
humans, and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he
means to insure its superiority. He has managed to translate the ancient
vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful
vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable. It's up to Blade to see that
this doesn't transpire.</P>
<P>Admittedly, Blade is style over substance through and through. The story is
a relatively forgettable one, but it is fun none the less. The acting in
Blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type. This
isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances, and the
actors know this. The movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think
otherwise. It's a popcorn movie, and no one involved has any illusions
otherwise.</P>
<P>Blade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your
typical summer blockbuster. The combat sequences between Blade and his
vampire targets are incredibly well done. Although, the MTV-style cuts did
get on my nerves after a while during long sequences.
Blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre. This is
not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living
in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle. What Blade excels at is
bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh
outlook on life. Very cool.</P>
