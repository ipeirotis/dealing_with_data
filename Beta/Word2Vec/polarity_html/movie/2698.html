<P>     The most stimulating and intellectually-challenging of ideas do
not always make the best of movies.  IN CUSTODY is a prime example of
this.  There is much meat here to chew on, but the flavor is in doubt.
By devoting all its attention to a dry, didactic examination of the
disappearance of the Urdu language, this movie has filled the screen
with poorly-realized characters that function as little more than
mouthpieces for getting across the director's point-of-view.</P>
<P>     Back in the early days of Merchant-Ivory, before the
producer/director team turned their attention to sumptuous British
dramas (such as A ROOM WITH A VIEW, HOWARDS END, and THE REMAINS OF THE
DAY), films such as SHAKESPEARE WALLAH explored India and Indian
themes.  In Ismail Merchant's directorial debut, this part of the world
is again visited, albeit with considerably less impact.</P>
<P>     The story begins with a meek teacher named Deven (Om Puri)
attempting to arrange a meeting with the great Urdu poet Nur (a
corpulent Shashi Kapoor, who was much trimmer when he appeared in
SHAKESPEARE WALLAH).  Armed with an antiquated reel-to-reel tape
recorder, Deven overcomes the financial demands of one of Nur's wives
(Sushma Seth), and the jealousy of the other (Shabana Azmi) to conduct
the interview.  Much to his dismay, however, Nur is not the great man
that his reputation suggests.  Rather than reciting verse and sharing
his philosophical views on life, he would rather drink rum and eat
biryani.</P>
<P>     Despite excellent performances from veteran actors Om Puri and
Shashi Kapoor, the two main characters in IN CUSTODY lack depth.  They
function as Merchant's tools to examine the dissolution of a language
and the subsequent impact of that event on Indian culture as a whole.
Never is a substantial emotional bond forged between the viewer and
either Deven or Nur.  When a film can't make an audience care about the
protagonists, how much more imposing a task is it to generate interest
in an issue?</P>
<P>     There are flashes of near-brilliance in IN CUSTODY.  The principal
theme--the shunting aside of Urdu for Hindi--is intellectually
engaging.  The parallels between the language's decline and that of its
premier poet are equally worthy of exploration.  Also, Merchant
displays a deft hand at capturing the essence of a poverty-stricken
India being reluctantly forced into the electronic age.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the glue to hold these elements together isn't in
place.  The tone, with its bursts of comedy and out-of-place melodrama,
is uneven, and IN CUSTODY's running time is far too long.  But the real
disappointment is that Deven and Nur are never more than shadows of the
personalities that they could be.  Too much time that could be used to
delve beneath the surface currents of these mens' lives is devoted too
reading poetry.</P>
<P>     Individual appreciation of IN CUSTODY will largely depend on what
you expect from a film.  Too many of today's theatrical offerings fall
into the "all form, little substance" category.  In this case, the
opposite is true.  What might make for an interesting dissertation
doesn't fare nearly as well in the context of a motion picture.</P>
