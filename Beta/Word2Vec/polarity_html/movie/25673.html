<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is one of those films that you feel ashamed you saw. The characters
appear to be not as bad as they seem, or as good as they seem--they just
seem to be vapid. It is a film that has no direction or sense of what it
wants to say, except to look good like commercials do and with the hope
that it can be accepted as a "feel good" movie by the kind of public
that will see anything in the summer as long as the film moves fast.</P>
<P>Everything about this film is a sham, from the repulsive bar it
highlights to the inane relationship it features. It felt like I was
dropped into a pit with some of the most obnoxious types you would ever
want to meet and was told that the only way to get out of this trap, was
to shake my ass like they do.</P>
<P>The producer who brought us this piece of schlock is the schlockmeister
himself, Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of such feeble projects as
Flashdance, Top Gun, and Armageddon, who has lived up to his low
standards with "Coyote Ugly."</P>
<P>Violet (Piper Perabo) is an aspiring songwriter from South Amboy, New
Jersey, who lives with her widower dad, Bill (John Goodman). She is a
wholesome girl, with no noticeable tattoos, body piercing, or drug
habit. She also has a pleasing voice, except she freezes when she has to
perform in public. Her mother was a singer, but didn't pursue her goal
when she got married to her NJ State toll booth collector husband, and
she told Violet that she always regretted not taking a chance and
pursuing a musical career. Violet is the same age as her mother was when
she went to the Big Apple, but changed her mind upon her husband's
insistence. Now that Violet is off to the city, having quit her job in
the pizza parlor, her dad worries about her safety, offering her the
sound advice, "Don't hesitate to use the pepper-spray." His role is to
be an adult, crack some jokes, try to give the film a heart, and not to
seem too embarrassed when he is reduced to shaking his ass on top of
that ugly frathouse dream bar the film has created to do its Flashdance
formula film again, but this time without fresh music or script.</P>
<P>After her lifetime friend Gloria (Melanie) helps her move into a shabby
apartment in Chinatown, the hardship of breaking into the business hits
home, as she gets rebuffed in all her efforts to get her demo tape
listened to. A bartender plays a cruel joke on her when she tries to get
info from him, telling her that Mr. Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia) is a
record producer. When she hands him her demo tape, she finds out that
he's only a hamburger flipper, which is only one job among the many jobs
the handsome Australian orphan needs in order to survive in this
expensive city. His only noteworthy habit is collecting rare comic
books. After the shaky start they get off to, he turns out to be a nice
guy (he doesn't come onto her like an animal) and she slowly realizes
that he's handsome and available, so this uninteresting romance
predictably takes place while she forges ahead with her career plans.</P>
<P>Everything seems to be going wrong for Violet--but, to make matters
worst, when she returns to her apartment, her place has been burglarized
and ransacked. With little money left, she goes with her head down to an
all-night diner and the kindly owner, feeling sorry for her, gives her a
free piece of pie. She gets all enthused when she overhears the loud
conversation of three supermodel types dressed like sluts and sees them
wave around the wads of money they earned, and finds out that they are
dancing bargirls in an East Village bar called Coyote Ugly, which
features the Western look and Charlie Daniels Band type of country
music, where the girls shake their asses on top of the bar and when not
stomping on the bar, flirt with the sardine-like customers who are
cramped together, screaming their heads off in some maddening bar scene
fit for imbeciles. The girls are hired to lead the men on sexually but
are not allowed to go further than that or date them.</P>
<P>The bar is run by the bold, blonde hussy Lil (Maria Bello), who hires
her on the spot as one of the dancing bargirls clad in sexy halter tops.
The other star bargirls are Rachel (Bridget Moynahan) and Cammie
(Izabella Miko), who are seen dancing atop the bar-which at times is in
flames, doing slick moves when mixing drinks, such as tossing glasses up
into the stratosphere, and squirting a hose full of water at their too
eager customers. Because of all the trickery involved, doubles for the
bargirls were used. Zoe (Tyra Banks), one of the other star bargirls,
has just quit to shake her ass as a law student. The bouncer trying to
control the sexually crazed, drunken crowd of men and women, is Lou. It
seems odd to have only one enforcer in a place that is built for
trouble, but then again, hardly anything about this film made sense.</P>
<P>The film ends on this supposedly endearing note, as Piper Perabo
innocently exclaims, "What do you do when you realize all your dreams
have come true?"</P>
<P>The film was about Violet trying to convince her boyfriend and her
father that the bar job she has is not as bad it seems. By the film's
end, she will make it in the musical field, lose her fear of performing
in public, go out with her nice boyfriend and reconcile with her lovable
dad. But, I'd like to see Violet try and convince anyone who is not
brain dead that this film has a modicum of intelligence in it. An actor
could only hope to come out of a film like this unscathed, that Piper
Perabo does, is a credit to her, which is probably due to the innocent
kindergarten teacher look she conveys. The film received a PG rating,
despite its image of a bar from hell. But there are no hot sex scenes to
satisy an audience it might be appealing to... . I haven't a clue who
this movie will please, but it sure isn't me.</P>
