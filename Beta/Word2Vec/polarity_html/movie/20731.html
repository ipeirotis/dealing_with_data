<PRE>GUINEVERE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Harper Sloane (Sarah Polley from GO and THE SWEET HEREAFTER) is the
unhappy product of a family of lawyers.  ("My family, none of us, can do
anything except doodle on legal pads.")  This being the movies, her
family is hopelessly dysfunctional, so she leaps at the opportunity to
abandon her chances at Harvard in order to take up with a photographer,
Connie Fitzpatrick (Stephen Rea from THE CRYING GAME), who is older than
her father.</P>
<P>Writer and director Audrey Wells's GUINEVERE suffers from a paucity of
ideas.  After setting up the plot of an older man becoming the mentor
and lover to a Lolita-style character just beyond the age of consent,
Wells has trouble finding ways to make the predictable story interesting
and to give her characters any credibility or depth.  The result is a
film that is as dull as dishwater.</P>
<P>Having just left a screening (ROMANCE by Catherine Breillat) in which
the filmmaker took great risks but failed spectacularly, I found that
even that film was in some ways preferable to GUINEVERE.  At least
Breillat tried.  Wells, on the other hand, makes a movie that's as inert
as outer space.  Better to swing at the ball than just stare at it with
the hope that the pitcher will walk you.  GUINEVERE, except for a few
random scenes that are sharply written, quickly becomes tedious.</P>
<P>One of the good scenes, which pales in contrast to similar ones in
AMERICAN BEAUTY, happens at the Sloane's dinner table.  Harper doesn't
participate in her family's intellectual jousting match, offering no
opinions on the subject at hand.  "How does one get into Harvard without
opinions," her father (Francis Guinan) asks in disdain.  "That's what
she gets there," her mother (Jean Smart) retorts.  "They'll teach her
plenty of opinions."</P>
<P>Surreptitiously, Harper moves in with Connie, who calls her his
Guinevere.  Viewing himself as a one-man art institute, he wants her to
take up any artistic endeavor and commit to stay with him for 5 years.
This turns out to be a tradition.  Gina Gershon plays Billie, one of his
previous Guineveres.</P>
<P>Soon he is manipulating Harper with false compliments and fake emotional
outbursts.  He lectures her constantly about photography and dedication
to her art.  "You take pictures when it hurts so bad you can't stand it
any more," he instructs her -- an example of the film's typically
stilted dialog.</P>
<P>"I've been thinking," Connie tells Harper in one of their many low
points together.  "You know what we need?  What we really need here is
some fun."  And so does the audience.  Needless to say, the fun does not
materialize.</P>
<P>"You call me if anything happens," Billie says towards the end.  My
sentiments exactly.  I'll be in the lobby.</P>
<P>GUINEVERE runs 1:44.  It is rated R for strong language and sexuality
and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
