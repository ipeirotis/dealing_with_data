<P>     In the course of cinematic history, there have been many great 
quests:  searches for the Holy Grail, the Ark of the Covenant, the true 
nature of Humankind, the essence of God, and, during this film from 
Chinese director Zhou Xiaowen, a 29-inch television.  In ERMO, a 
somewhat better-constructed cousin to Zhang Yimou's THE STORY OF QUI JU, 
we follow the obsessive struggle of one woman (Alia) to earn the money 
to buy the biggest television in her village.  There's no sacrifice she 
won't make, an attitude that her aging, impotent husband (Ge Zhijun) is 
incapable of understanding.  In his view, money is for building houses, 
not buying gadgets. </P>
<P>     If Ermo's marriage is bad, it's no worse than that of her next-door 
neighbor, Blindman (Liu Peiqi), whose overweight, shrill wife (Zhang 
Haiyan) is jealous of the thinner, prettier Ermo, who was able to bear 
her husband a son.  Blindman finds Ermo a job in a nearby city, where 
she can make more money than in their small village.  On the road, the 
two become lovers, but theirs isn't exactly one of the great screen 
romances.  Blindman talks about leaving his wife, but it's clear he's 
not serious, especially when he tells Ermo that she's a good person at 
heart, but he isn't. </P>
<P>     The overall theme of ERMO echoes a simple truism:  it's often 
better wanting than having.  Ermo's entire life is focused on getting 
the television; what happens when she actually accumulates the money to 
buy it?  When her life has a goal, she is vibrant, energetic, and 
pugnacious.  Afterwards, how much of that will be replaced by apathy?  
Zhou is certainly criticizing materialism here, but only in the larger 
context of examining how we define meaning in our lives. </P>
<P>     As was the case in QUI JU, we are presented with a vivid contrast 
between rural and urban China.  Ermo's backwater village is still living 
in the past; the city is, for the most part, modern.  However, where 
Zhang's film tended to meander, ERMO stays focused, and the interaction 
between Blindman and Ermo presents a sexual element absent from the 
earlier movie.   </P>
<P>     An expert at capturing subtle mannerisms, Alia possesses the same 
kind of screen presence exhibited by Gong Li.  Although there's nothing 
wrong with her delivery of dialogue, the actress' facial expressions are 
her greatest asset.  Ermo is not an exceptionally well-written 
character, but Alia does an excellent job of breathing life into her.   </P>
<P>     ERMO is certainly on less ambitious footing than the recent string 
of grand historical epics coming from China.  In many ways, this is 
refreshing, as the simpler story gives the viewer a different view of 
Chinese culture.  And, although the message of ERMO is presented 
seriously, Zhou isn't above having a little fun, and his lighter touch 
is one of the most refreshing elements of this enjoyable little drama. </P>
