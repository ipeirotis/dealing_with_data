<P>     In the depths of Paris' infamous Bastille, circa 1662, five figures
stand.  One man is the reason the other four have gathered:  he is
Phillippe (Leonardo DiCaprio) -- the long-imprisoned twin brother of King
Louis XIV (also DiCaprio) -- rescued by these benefactors to replace his
despotic sibling on the throne.  The four other men are figures of legend:
retired Musketeers Aramis (Jeremy Irons), Athos (John Malkovich) and
Pothos (Gerard Depardieu), reunited with their old comrade D'Artagnan
(Gabriel Byrne).  As they prepare to face the King's guard, armaments and
odds heavily against them, the figures cross their swords and utter one of
literature's best-known oaths of allegiance:  "One for all, all for one."</P>
<P>     It is the moment most of the audience -- the non-teenage-female,
DiCaprio-swooning portion -- has been waiting for.  It is a moment
guaranteed to inspire pseudo-spontaneous applause and whoops of
approval...assuming the audience hasn't drifted into a heavy slumber.  For
around 100 minutes, Randall Wallace's rendition of THE MAN IN THE IRON
MASK wanders through attractive sets in search of a consistent tone,
thematic coherence or even a real point.  Is it a lavish, lusty period
romp in the spirit of Richard Lester's 1970s MUSKETEERS films?  Is it a
moody Dickensian pot-boiler of a mysterious parentage and uncertain
motivations?  Is it a showcase for Tiger Beat poster-boy-du-jour DiCaprio?
Is it _ever_ going to get down to the business of Musketeers buckling a
few swashes?  Wallace effectively combined vengeance, romance and
adventure in his script for BRAVEHEART, but in his first film behind the
camera he never seems clear how to unite all the elements he introduces.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK sputters and hesitates like the work of a nervous
rookie who just keeps throwing stuff at the screen in the vain hope that,
eventually, something's gotta stick.</P>
<P>     The uninvolving and ponderous first hour and a half leaves a viewer
plenty of time to scratch at minor annoyances until they become major
annoyances.  Meticulously smudged rabble rouse themselves for a minor riot
for exactly one scene, perhaps to distract momentarily from the impression
that this is an epic with a cast of tens.  Half the cast speaks with
French accents (all genuine, courtesy Depardieu, Anne Parillaud and
plasticine ingenue Judith Godreche), while the other half appears to have
wandered in from Malibu, or London, or Dublin.  Given the chance to bite
into Louis XIV's nastiness with relish, DiCaprio instead gives him a
tiresome Method twist which suggests he just wants to be loved.  And who
is Peter Sarsgaard (playing the son of Aramis), and has anyone ever done a
more frighteningly dead-on impression of John Malkovich?</P>
<P>     All might have been forgiven if only Wallace had played the Musketeer
trump card for all it was worth.  He's got viewers right where he wants
them with such iconic characters at his disposal; the good will is as
palpable as it is at a James Bond film, where the mere utterance of a
trademark phrase generates a ripple of excitement.  There's just no good
excuse to waste that kind of good will on one or two rounds of lackluster
swordplay.  Dumas wrote wonderful pulp; Wallace tries to turn that pulp
into something it's not, only he's not exactly sure what that is.  THE MAN
IN THE IRON MASK is a big muddled mess of an adventure yarn, satisfying
only for those interested in going to watch DiCaprio in regal finery
looking his prettiest.  Others will find a waste of stellar cast and
classic story which never gets a handle on what the film should have been
about for the average viewer:  a chance to cheer for the crossed swords of
re-born legends just a bit earlier than 100 minutes after the lights go
down.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Louis Louis's:  4.</PRE>
