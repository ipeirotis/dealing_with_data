<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An amusingly rich and stimulating tale about a successful Dallas-based
gynecologist, Dr. T (Gere), who thinks he understands women better than
anyone else in town. He has been faithful despite all the temptations
around him to his gorgeous wife Kate (Farrah Fawcett). They have two
lovely, independent-minded, college-aged daughters, Dee Dee (Kate
Hudson) and Connie (Tara Reid), and he has all the family love and
material comforts he desires, living an upper-class bourgeois lifestyle.
But in Robert Altman's gentle and perceptive comedy, this is not enough.
The film becomes a satirical study of the doctor and the upper-crust
society folks he comes into contact with. The good doctor will get his
needed come-uppance about thinking he knows so much about women, as all
the ideals and fantasies he builds around them will come crashing down
upon him. Appropriately enough, this is a film set in the fall, and the
mood and the color of the film reflects that time of year, in all its
beauty and in its surprisingly stormy weather.</P>
<P>The film moves at its own gracefully slow speed, showing the trivial
things in Sully Travis' life that make him think like he does, as the
charming, handsome, popular doctor, who is as smooth in his bedside
conversations as he is when he examines a woman's insides with his
speculum, whose waiting room is a maddening cluster of idle chatter and
angst from all the female patients waiting to be examined by him, where
even his daffy, loyal office manager Carolyn (Long), vies for his
undivided attention among all the other woman, as she has a longstanding
crush on him.</P>
<P>As an added touch to feminine sensitivity, he has examining rooms named
after local female celebrities  - Belle Starr, Phyllis George and Gov.
Ann Richards.</P>
<P>The gynecologist's philosophical musings about his knowledge of women is
given freely to his bird hunting buddies, as he pontificates, "Women are
by nature sacred and should be treated as saints."</P>
<P>But Sully's wife has a psychological breakdown, as she dances in the
upscale mall water display fountain while nude and is sent by him to a
private mental hospital rest home, to be treated by Dr. Harper (Lee
Grant). She is baffled by her problem, but surmises it's a rare
mythological complex that she suffers from, that affects only
upper-class women who are loved too much and come to reject this love,
retreating into a childlike state.</P>
<P>Into Sully's life comes an attractive new golf pro teacher at his
country club, Bree Davis (Hunt), and the two soon start an affair, with
the doctor smugly telling her that every woman is unique. She concurs
that if anyone would know, it's him. She is seen as being different than
the other women in his life: she's an athlete, wearing casual clothes
such as chinos and is not impressed by his acts of gentlemanly chivalry,
as she has made up her mind that she wants to have sex with him and he
doesn't have to play any games to have her. But the most important
difference, is that she's a take charge woman, and this is really a turn
on to the already smitten Dr. T.</P>
<P>With his wife's rejection of him, Sully's life begins to dramatically
change. His recently divorced, alcoholic sister-in-law, dressed
ostentaciously in feathery outfits, Peggy (Laura Dern), comes to stay
with him bringing along her three toddler daughters. His conspiracy buff
daughter Connie, who is a tour guide, shocks him by telling him that his
Dallas Cowboy cheerleader daughter Dee Dee, who will shortly be getting
married, had a lesbian affair with the maid of honor Marilyn (Tyler),
and shouldn't be getting married because she's still in love with
Marilyn.</P>
<P>At last, after many recent bombs, Gere has found a film that goes hand
in hand with his laconic style and intelligent grace, as he plays a
sympathetic character, someone who seems very comfortable with this
dazzling role around so many women and comes across as a good doctor and
a generous person who is trying his best to be the Man around a sea of
women. There doesn't seem to be much tragedy here, it seems that script
writer Anne Rapp and the 75-year-old Altman are only gently chiding the
doctor for thinking he can ever understand women, and the film plays
more like a big joke on him than anything else. What unravels for him,
are all things he can easily rebound from, as the film ends with the
song "Ain't It Something The Way Things Go" being played as the credits
roll by, after an unpredictable ending to a sweetly bizarre film.</P>
