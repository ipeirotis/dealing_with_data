<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Set in the 1930s, in the rural province of China called Sichuan. In
reality that was a time of great poverty and unrest and this film serves
as a humanistic response to that age of intolerance and greed, though
the film does not make a direct political statement. The director Wu
Tianming was one of the founders of 'fifth generation' directors and
left China after the Tiananmen Square uprising, only to return in 1995.
This is his first film in ten years and it is sponsored by the Chinese
government, and one of its chief faults is that the film used bad film
stock, as it seemed out of focus and grainy. On the positive side, it is
a colorful and heart-tugging though highly manipulative melodrama,
filled with obvious reactions against injustices, but whose voice is
always on the side of the artist and those who are disenfranchised in
society.</P>
<P>The story centers around an elderly street performer who is a fast
changer of silk masks. He has no male heir and according to the ancient
customs, he can only pass the art onto a male. To remedy this, concerned
his art will die with him, he adopts an 8-year-old son and is pleased
when he calls him grandpa, but soon realizes that he has been fooled
into taking a girl.</P>
<P>Bian Lian Wang (Zhu Xu), the King of Masks, is a crowd favorite among
those in the streets, who makes his money on donations. Seeing him
perform his speedy changing faces, is a much idolized opera singer of
the time, Liang Sao Lang (Zhao Zhigang), who is a female impersonator.
He shows such tremendous admiration for the King's gifts, that he asks
to learn the old man's tricks, which he is willing to pay him a huge sum
for and put him in his more prestigious show. The poverty-stricken Old
Master turns him down while expressing great appreciation for the offer,
but maintains his artistic secrets can only be passed onto a male heir.
What he takes to heart, is the impersonator's plea for him to find a
male heir. In the next town the Old Master goes to, that is struck with
floods and personal misfortune, he bargains with an unscrupulous man in
the black market and pays $5 for what he is told is a boy. The lonely
man, who lost his only son many years ago, is moved by hearing himself
called grandpa and agrees to the price even though it is too high for
him.</P>
<P>The film will go on to dispel China's ancient notions that a girl is not
as valuable as a boy. Doggie (Zhou Ren-ying) will do everything that she
can to try and please grandpa, but he resists teaching her his gifts
when he learns that he is a girl. Still, he is the only one who has
showed her any kindness in her short life and she offers to call him
boss and work as a cook and cleaner for him, rather than have him kick
her out of his river boathouse. He reluctantly agrees to this
arrangement, and as they live together he can't help feeling strongly
about her, but he just can't show it. When she causes him much grief and
leaves his place, she tries to make things right by taking a kidnapped
boy to him. This will result in him being framed as the kidnapper by the
venal police.</P>
<P>The film becomes predictable, as it shows how they are both shaped by
their experiences of the hard-times they live in and by the traditions.
She is a good-hearted girl and a real sweetie pie, while he shows signs
of being a very generous person, but can't get over his stubborness. As
a result, when the film's last act rolls around, what happens all feels
contrived and overacted, and I felt manipulated, especially when I saw
that the sweet little girl is even willing to die for her grandpa. One
would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by her actions of
self-sacrifice. Though the viewer is being shamelessly manipulated, the
story feels so strong and right, that it seems easy to get caught up in
the emotions of the moment and the beautifully arranged images that lit
the screen up with magical faces and gorgeous sets and costumes. And, if
the girl wasn't a charmer enough, and the Old Master and opera singer
didn't have expressive enough gestures to steal the scenes they were in,
there is the Old Master's monkey to even steal scenes from them, as he
repays the Old Master for his kindness by remaining completely devoted
to him, even after he is framed and jailed for kidnapping a young boy.
The film got ever so mushy, but it was so cleverly executed and I was
gladly taken in by Zhou Ren-ying and Zhu Xu pulling on my heart strings.</P>
