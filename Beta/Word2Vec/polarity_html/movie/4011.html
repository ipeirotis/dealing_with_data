<P>     Take the mentality of an old-fashioned Hollywood Western, bleed in
elements from Kevin Costner's DANCES WITH WOLVES, and start it out with
a sequence culled from THE FUGITIVE, and you get THE LAST OF THE
DOGMEN--a surprisingly entertaining, somewhat corny adventure film.
And, while there's an obviously politically-correct slant to the story,
that does nothing to dilute THE LAST OF THE DOGMEN's enjoyability.  The
movie isn't as accomplished as DANCES WITH WOLVES, but it doesn't have
either the length or quite the same aspirations.</P>
<P>     Lewis Gates (Tom Berenger) is an old-time, macho cowboy who loves
the rugged outdoors, carries a knife and a gun, and would rather not
take a woman into "the roughest country God's ever put on a map." As
the story opens, the local sheriff (Kurtwood Smith) has recruited
Lewis, the best tracker in the area, to go into the Oxbow Quadrangle in
search of three convicts.  After some convincing, Lewis agrees, and it
doesn't take him long to pick up his quarry's trail.  But, by the time
he catches up to them, all that's left are ripped clothes and a lot of
blood.  The bounty hunter returns to town empty-handed and full of
questions.</P>
<P>     For the answers, he goes to a leading Indian expert, Dr. Lillian
Sloan (Barbara Hershey), telling her he believes there are lost
warriors in the Oxbow.  At first, she thinks he's deluded, but as he
presents evidence accumulated from old newspaper clippings, her
interest is piqued.  Lewis wants one of her male associates to
accompnay him into the mountains--he needs someone who speaks
Cheyenne.  Much to his distress, however, she chooses to come herself,
and together they go in search of the last of the Cheyenne dogmen--the
possible descendants of survivors from 1864's Sand Creek Massacre.</P>
<P>     It's not really all that complicated a story, but someone from
Savoy Pictures disagreed, and the result is an extremely irritating
voiceover read by an uncredited Wilford Brimley.  I'm not fond of this
method of storytelling in the best of circumstances, but this is easily
the most intrusive and redundant narration in years.  THE LAST OF THE
DOGMEN would have been vastly improved without it.  Just as you're
really getting into the story, Brimley's voice pops up to interrupt the
flow.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, occasional plot contrivances aside, THE LAST OF THE
DOGMEN succeeds on several levels.  Despite a two-hour running length,
the movie keeps the audience's attention.  Berenger and Hershey work
well together, and their budding romance remains low-key.  The
cinematography is gorgeous, with effective use of the exhilarating
mountain scenery.  It's almost possible to believe that a lost tribe
could exist undetected out in that wilderness.  And a shot of a
high-flying airplane, reminding us that this is 1995, is a nice touch.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Tab Murphy pokes occasional fun at the macho
cowboy image while simultaneously embracing it through Berenger's
scruffy Lewis.  But the main point of the movie is that when people
finally find something they've spent their entire life searching for,
they'll risk anything to protect it.  The Cheyenne are Lewis'
redemption, and his interaction with them saves a guilt-ravaged
spirit.  This simple theme lies at the core of an adventure that, while
not original, is nevertheless satisfying.  THE LAST OF THE DOGMEN may
recall DANCES WITH WOLVES, but it seems less a copy than a different
story taking a similar path.</P>
