<P>     Jean-Claude Van Damme must have an affinity for working with Hong 
Kong directors (or maybe it's the other way around).  DOUBLE TEAM, 
directed by Tsui Hark (the ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA series, THE CHINESE 
FEAST), is his third such collaboration, following efforts with John Woo 
(HARD TARGET) and Ringo Lam (MAXIMUM RISK).  While Van Damme's 
physicality is an asset in such straight action pictures, his complete 
lack of acting range assures that lapses into drama, no matter how 
brief, will fail, and, as a result, there's a well-defined ceiling for 
how good a Van Damme vehicle can be.  DOUBLE TEAM approaches that 
ceiling.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, DOUBLE TEAM proceeds with tongue in cheek.  There are 
the requisite shoot-outs, fights, explosions, and chases to keep Van 
Damme die-hards happy, but there's also an impossible-to-miss sense of 
self-mocking.  Although DOUBLE TEAM is neither a straight satire nor as 
infectiously fun as a Jackie Chan flick, its lighter tone is refreshing 
in comparison with many of the too-serious action films that glut the 
market these days.</P>
<P>     Then, of course, there's basketball bad boy Dennis Rodman, who's 
making his big league "acting" debut here.  After DOUBLE TEAM, the jury 
is still out on whether Rodman has a future in movies.  His screen 
presence is undeniable, but all that's really required of him in this 
film is to change hairstyles every other scene, utter a few quips, and 
punch or kick just about everyone with whom he comes into contact.  Like 
Shaquille O'Neal and Michael Jordan, who paved the recent path from the 
court to the screen, Rodman has the personality to develop a motion 
picture career, but he'll have to do more than play sidekick to the 
likes of Van Damme.</P>
<P>     The story isn't as much of a throwaway as we have come to expect 
from Van Damme films.  In fact, it's so convoluted that at times it 
borders on being unintelligible.  Jack Quinn (Van Damme) is a retired 
counter-terrorism expert who was once regarded as the best in the 
business.  When his arch-nemesis, Stavros (a beefed-up Mickey Rourke), 
re-surfaces after three years of invisibility, Quinn leaves his pregnant 
wife, Katherine (Natacha Lindinger), to rejoin the service.  After 
stopping by a shop in Antwerp to buy specialty weapons from Yaz (Dennis 
Rodman), an eccentric arms dealer, Quinn heads into an amusement park 
confrontation with Stavros.  The operation turns into a bloodbath, with 
nearly all of Quinn's associates, along with Stavros' young son, dead.  
Quinn is seriously injured.</P>
<P>     He awakens from unconsciousness to find himself as a member of "The 
Colony", an ultra-secret anti-terrorism society comprised of agents who 
have screwed up, but are "too valuable to kill, but too dangerous to set 
free."  The Colony is a think-tank, the "last line of defense against 
global terrorism."  Since all of its members have been declared dead and 
its island location is escape-proof, no one knows about the Colony 
except those at the highest levels of various governments.  No one, that 
is, except Stavros.  And, while Quinn's experience and knowledge prove 
to be valuable assets to the Colony, he devotes much of his time and 
effort to devising a means of escape.</P>
<P>     Despite being financed with American money, not one scene of DOUBLE 
TEAM takes place in the United States.  The locations include the South 
of France, Rome, and Antwerp.  The director, who, like many of his Hong 
Kong contemporaries, is known for his visual flair, brings that aspect 
of his bag of tricks to this effort.  In fact, there are times when 
DOUBLE TEAM's polished look successfully distracts us from the 
preposterous plot.  </P>
<P>     As I indicated earlier, the film never takes itself too seriously.  
For example, while running around Rome, Quinn is aided in his attempt to 
track down Stavros by a group of "cybermonks" -- cloistered friars who 
spend their time surfing the Internet.  On another occasion, our hero 
pauses in the middle of a fight on an airplane to ascertain that his 
opponent is wearing a parachute.  There's also a unique product 
placement for Coke near the end of the film -- rarely has a "free" 
advertisement been so crucial to the outcome of a motion picture.  Last, 
but not least, is the climactic confrontation in the Coliseum which 
features Quinn kick-boxing a tiger (don't try that at home).</P>
<P>     Your reaction to DOUBLE TEAM will probably depend largely on how 
you feel about concussive action films.  While this one is better than 
most, it still falls considerably short of what I consider to be a 
"good" movie.  One thing's for sure, though:  like most flicks that 
boast more stuntmen than cast members, DOUBLE TEAM is unlikely to 
function as a Sominex.  You may not enjoy it, but you won't fall asleep.  
And that's the best thing I can say about this loud, brash, ultimately 
pointless morsel of eye candy.</P>
