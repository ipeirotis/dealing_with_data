<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>NO END takes place in Poland during the early '80s, it is at a time
Martial law was in place, and when any kind of minor resistance against
the government (political graffiti or striking) was met with a few years
of jail time. Kieslowski (Blue, Red, White, Decalogue) deals with this
from the humanistic point of view of a young, politically aware lawyer
Zyro (Jerzy), who dies from a heart attack and returns as a ghost to
watch all the sorrowful events that take place after his death. The film
focuses on three people whom he was concerned about: 1) Ula (Grazyma)
plays his widow, who can't get over loving him. What startles her is how
she didn't know how happy she was with him when he was alive. 2) His
client, the political activist Darek (Artur), who is now on trial for
being a union striker. Darek ideologically refuses to compromise his
position, even for a lenient sentence. 3) And the lawyer who takes
Zyro's place in defending Darek, his old mentor, a  much more wary and
pragmatical lawyer, Labrador (Bandini). Labrador takes the case only
after he learns that he is being forced to retire because he has reached
the mandatory age of 70, and decides he wants to make this controversial
case his swan song.</P>
<P>This film is bubbling over with passion for the Solidarity Movement, as
well as for the sensuousness and passion the widow feels for her
departed husband, so much so that she sees her husband in another man's
strong hands and makes ecstatic love with him in a one time stand.</P>
<P>The political argument of the times, is best seen through the eyes of
the idealistic, uncompromising Darek, who has a wife and child to
support, but still thinks he is "selling out" if he is set-free,
something his lawyer can get for him if he accepts "the gift horse of
freedom." While his lawyer works hard for his case, proud of his
client's integrity, but is convinced that there is no real choice, the
only choice is the more rational position, that he is better off not
going to jail. The "realpolitik" of this dilemma is powerfully
presented, as is the emotional state of Ula, internally wrestling with
her memories and conscience, trying desperately to find a way out of her
emotional entrapment.</P>
<P>The film was powerful enough in its political jibes to have made the
state and the church and the opposition party condemn it.Though this is
not the director's top-of-the line artistic work, it does fit positively
into his opus. His only failing moments, seemed to be in trying to get
the ghost involved with what was going on in the lives of those around
him. It seemed awkward and out of place in this straight forward film,
whose darkened cameras captured enough of the sobering mood of Poland
for the story to be a compelling one, a story about the unfinished
business of the struggle for freedom. The title seems to signify for the
director an unending search for political justice, something he was not
optimistic in achieving in such a repressive country.</P>
