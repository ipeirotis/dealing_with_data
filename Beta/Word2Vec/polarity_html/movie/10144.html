<P>Quentin Tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big
careers.  After his PULP FICTION, many actors began receiving many
offers for jobs.  John Travolta made his come-back and is now one of
today's most bankable stars.  Bruce Willis proved his acting chops and
is now considered an actual actor.  JACKIE BROWN, on the other hand,
boasts quite a well known cast, except for the main lead: Pam Grier.
Most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films, but she's
never really had a breakthrough performance (her first film was in the
Roger Ebert-written BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS).  That is, until
now.</P>
<P>JACKIE BROWN is a highly anticipated feature film from Quentin Tarantino, whose last film was the huge hit
PULP FICTION.  After mediocre acting jobs, Tarantino returns to what made his name a household one: directing
and writing.  JACKIE BROWN is the result, and it is fantastic entertainment.  Despite excellent direction from
Tarantino, the cast steals the film, giving one good performance after another.  Pam Grier gives a stunning
performance as Jackie Brown, and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--Samuel L. Jackson, Bridget
Fonda, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, and Robert Forster.  More than likely, you will see a few of these
names in the Oscar pool come Oscar nominations.</P>
<P>Describing a Quentin Tarantino film is very difficult, as you really
can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else.  I will tread
lightly.  JACKIE BROWN opens with an impressive shot of Jackie Brown
(Grier) in a blue outfit walking through the airport.  The camera
tracks along with her, and ends up revealing her occupation.  We are
also introduced to Ordell Robbie (Jackson), who sells illegal guns to
interested buyers...  for a hefty price.  Ms. Brown carries the money
from buyer to Ordell in order to keep the cops away.  However, an FBI
agent (Keaton) and a local L.A. cop (Michael Bowen) are out to find
Ordell and catch him while taking the money.  They try to reach him
through Beaumont Livingston (Chris Tucker), one of Ordell's buyers,
but he mysteriously ends up dead.  They try again through Brown, but
she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing.</P>
<P>But after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of Ordell's friends
(Fonda), she is caught and sent to jail.  Ordell pays her bail through
a bail bond agent, Max Cherry (Forster), and then wants to find out
what she told the cops.  After she claims to have said nothing, she
reveals the fact that she will tell them about Ordell in order to stay
out of prison.  Ordell doesn't like this, but they both come up with a
scheme to throw the Feds and cops off their track.  This scheme seems
to be going as planned, but unexpected occurances may or may not foul
up their goal.</P>
<P>Revealing more would spoil the fun of JACKIE BROWN, and that's the
biggest reason to go see a Tarantino film.  Tarantino seems to have a
fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments (and slang terms),
but they are always done very well and believably.  His hitmen are
normally cruel, but pleasant, in that nasty sort of way.  They talk
like normal people, except for when doing business, and they are rude
to their girlfriends.  Of course, this is a Tarantino film, and you
know you can expect some awkward situations to arise.  And perhaps the
biggest flaw with JACKIE BROWN is the slow middle section in which the
pace begins to drop.  Of course, Tarantino fixes this by moving onto
the climax of the film, adding a lot of his RESERVOIR DOGS-style
storytelling to it.  Things are told from one person's perspective,
and then from another, and then from another, each time learning more
and more.  This all leads up to a very interesting conclusion, which
decides who is on whose side.</P>
<P>On the technical side of JACKIE BROWN, Quentin Tarantino directs it
with the same style as he did with his 1994 film.  However, this time
around it isn't as nearly as impressive or original.  The writing, on
the other hand, is quite good, although I do find Tarantino's use of
slang terms offensive.  The story jumps back and forth in time as in
PULP FICTION, but it's much more easy to understand.  His previous
film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time
differentiation, but JACKIE BROWN is very simply to follow, especially
considering that the time is given during the "leaps" in time.
Perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the
novel "Rum Punch" by Elmore Leonard.  The dialogue is pretty much
intelligent, and all the characters are fully realized.  The
cinematography is very well done by Guillermo Navarro (who has worked
with Tarantino on previous films) and the editing is very good.  And
as with PULP FICTION, the music is a highlight, bringing back
memorable songs from the 70s and 80s.</P>
<P>The acting side of JACKIE BROWN is unforgettable.  The performances
are incredibly rich, with hidden meaning behind every characters'
actions.  Nothing is quite as it seems, and you can't really tell
which side one person is on.  The real treat, of course, is Pam Grier
who gives an astonishing performance as Jackie Brown.  Her poor living
conditions are superceded by her superior wits, which play an
important role in the film.  Watching Grieg, I could tell what was
going through her mind, even if I didn't know what she was thinking.
Her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad,
happy, or in deep thought.  Bridget Fonda gives a very good
performance as a druggie couch potato.  I didn't even realize it was
Fonda until I saw her name in the final credits (her performance
actually reminded me of Heather Graham's in BOOGIE NIGHTS).  Michael
Keaton comes across very well, as does Michael Bowen.  Chris Tucker
has a small, but effective performance.  Samuel L. Jackson is very
good, but it seems to me that he was replaying his Jules Winnfield
character from PULP FICTION (although much less cynical).  But no
matter... Jackson is very strong in his role.  Robert De Niro is
actually a little annoying at times, but overall he does a good job as
one of Ordell's perspective clients and friends.  Robert Forster gives
one of the best performances in the film, as he has one of the most
developed characters.  He is present throughout most of the film, and
he holds his own against Jackson and Grier.</P>
<P>JACKIE BROWN is rated R for language, sex, violence, drug use, and
some offensive remarks.  As a film by itself, JACKIE BROWN is a
terrific piece of entertainment, with a complex plot to draw viewers
in.  However, one can not help but compare it to Tarantino's PULP
FICTION, and expect great results.  When compared, it comes up short,
but not that short.  It's a worthy effort, with terrific acting and
some impressive writing from Elmore Leonard and Tarantino.  Perhaps
the best thing about JACKIE BROWN is the discovery of Pam Grier as a
major Hollywood actress.  I can't remember seeing her in anything
(except for a small role in MARS ATTACKS!), but hopefully she will get
many more roles from this one.  Expect to see her name floating around
the Oscar nominations (and hopefully she will even be able to nab
one).</P>
