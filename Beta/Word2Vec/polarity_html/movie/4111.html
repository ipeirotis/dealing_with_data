<PRE>                                TO DIE FOR
                       A film review by Terri Buchman
                        Copyright 1995 Terri Buchman</PRE>
<P>     In Brief:  Best bleak comedy film since HEATHERS.  Full of
wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so
much of modern American pop culture.  Go see it!</P>
<P>     So, I prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on
"Hard Copy" with Pam Smart, the New Hampshire Media teacher who was
convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's.
"Hard Copy"'s Diane Diamond asked Smart what she thought about Nicole
Kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film TO DIE FOR.
Smart replied that she thought Kidman's character came off as a dumb,
vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie
generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal.
(Smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the
murder of her husband.)  Smart's got a point.  It wouldn't be the first
time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie
version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less
artistic real life version.   However, given a choice between the mass
media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie, I
would definitely opt for the later.  Real murderers rarely have
dialogue as witty as what Buck Henry has written for this movie and
Smart, while pretty and alluring, is no match for the cinematic charms
of Nicole Kidman.</P>
<P>     TO DIE FOR begins in a town called Little Hope, New Hampshire, the
archetypal dry and intellectually barren American suburb.  The story
concerns the ambitious Suzanne Stone and how she tackles the obstacles
between her and her life long ambition of being 'on TV.'  Of course,
one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious
husband Larry, played by Matt Dillon.  But, with a little imagination,
some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to Junior
Achievement, Our Heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life,
at least temporarily.</P>
<P>     Kidman triumphs in the trashy role of Suzanne.  I have never
really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful
flair for comedy in this picture.  Her portrayal of the incredibly
shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates.  Kidman knows a star-making
role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived Suzanne as
the ultimate career driven, post-feminist uber-temptress from hell.  She
is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue, which Kidman
delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way.  At one point Suzanne is
expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and
sister-in-law.  "You know," she knowingly exclaims, "Gorbachev would
still be the leader of Russia or whatever, if he had just had that ugly
purplish thing removed from his head."  Her husband beams at Suzanne's
profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that
this qualifies her to be the next Barbara Walters.  This is very close
to pop culture bashing heaven, folks.</P>
<P>     The other standout performance in the film is delivered by Joaquin
Phoenix.  He plays Jimmy, a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to
Suzanne's sexual favors.  Kidman's character, vapid though she is, is a
sort of suave beacon of success to Jimmy and his lost friends Russell
and Lydia, winningly portrayed by Casey Affleck and Alison Folland.
Phoenix looks like the very embodiment of Gen-X slackerhood (as
envisioned by tabloid TV, of course).  His Jimmy has the dead eyes and
demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere, ever.
Phoenix reacts to the sexy Suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement
and he makes us believe that a loser character like Jimmy really would
be willing to kill for someone like Suzanne, someone who actually
noticed him.</P>
<P>     Gus Van Sant (DRUGSTORE COWBOY, MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO) direction is
first-rate.  He keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping
along.  Van Sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral
Suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the
rightness or wrongness of her actions.  Van Sant trusts his material
and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is
funny about this All-American story.  The screenplay, by Buck Henry, is
absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines I've
heard since HEATHERS.  Henry's story is a blast against the shallowness
of the American media and the mindlessness of fame, yet the screenplay
delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters.
Henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many
targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic.  Danny Elfman
did the original music for this movie and he delivers another
eccentric, loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for EDWARD
SCISSORHANDS.  Either film score would make wonderful background music
for Halloween Trick-or-Treat parties.  All-in-all, a wonderful
production, well worth your seven bucks!</P>
