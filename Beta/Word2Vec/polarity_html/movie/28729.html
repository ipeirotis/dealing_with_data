<PRE>SHREK
-----</PRE>
<P>Once upon a time a solitary ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) was really annoyed
to discover that his swamp had been invaded by three blind mice, seven dwarves
and all the other fairy tale characters in the land, banished from their
home by Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow).  Unwittingly befriended by a non-stop
talking donkey (Eddie Murphy), Shrek travels to Dulloc to speak with Farquaad,
where he stumbles into a joust and comes up the winner.  His prize?  To save 
Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a tower surrounded by molten flame and 
protected by a dragon so she can become Farquaad's bride.  The ogre agrees to 
the task in return for getting his solitary lifestyle back in "Shrek."</P>
<P>It took four writers (Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio ("The Road to El Dorado"), 
Roger S.H. Schulman ("Balto") and Joe Stillman ("Beavis and Butthead Do 
America")) to adapt William Steig's children's book.  The bad news?  They've
genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under the influence of
William Goldman's "The Princess Bride."  The good news?  There's so much
wacky humor culled from both fairy tales and popular culture that this
movie should keep you in stitches.  </P>
<P>We get our first inkling that we're in for a real treat as one of Farquaad's
men, intent on rounding up magical creatures offers 'Five schillings for the 
possessed boy!' after observing Dreamworks' rendition of Disney's animated 
Pinocchio.  Meanwhile within the castle walls, a gingerbread man being tortured</P>
<P>by Farquaad spits icing and yells 'Eat me!' before breaking down and solemnly 
asking 'Do you know the muffin man?'</P>
<P>Shrek, a green giant with bobbly antennae-like ears, is a grumpy recluse who
really yearns to fit in (although who could put up with his habit of making
candles from his own ear wax?).  Donkey is a hyperactive, endearingly stunted
creature who can talk and, therefore, believes will make a great misfit pairing
with the uncooperative Shrek.  Donkey proves his worth sweet talking the
princess-guarding dragon.  The Princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat
after learning she's not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she's been
expecting.  When Fiona's true colors are exposed (including opportunies for
some tomboyish gross out humor), a spark develops between her and Shrek.</P>
<P>The script's details are gleefully impish, constantly poking fun at Disney 
from the theme park world of Farquaad's Dulloc with its turnstyle entrance and
'It's a Small World' parody of an information booth to the blue bird which
meets a most un-Disneyish fate after duetting with Fiona 'Snow White' style.
Popular culture is represented with film references to "Babe" and "Charlies'
Angels" via "The Matrix." </P>
<P>Myers chooses his 'So I Married an Axe Murderer' Scottish brogue for Shrek
in order to give his voice some heft.  While this may prove distracting for
anyone familiar with that film, overall it works more than not.  Eddie Murphy
steals the show as the fast-talking, Motown-singing Donkey, proving once
again his talent as a vocal performer (is it another wink at Disney that 
Donkey is paired with a dragon, a creature Murphy portrayed in Disney's
'Mulan?').  Lithgow's a good choice for the supercilious, height-challenged
villain Lord Farquaad.  Diaz is energetic but ultimately nondescript voicing 
Princess Fiona.  (A better choice would have been Minnie Driver, who's proven 
herself a terrific vocal talent in such diverse animations as Disney's 
"Tarzan," "Princess Mononoke" and the "South Park" movie.)</P>
<P>The computer animation looks terrific (particularly Donkey), although it
won't elicit the types of oohs and aahs of Pixar's work ("Toy Story," "A
Bug's Life," "Toy Story 2").  In keeping with its hip style, pop music
is used, which like Myer's voice may be initially jarring, but ultimately 
satisfies (while surveying bridal candidates via a 'Dating Game' parody 
broadcast by Snow White's Evil Queen's mirror, Farquaad is told 'Fiona 
likes pina coladas' - cue Jimmy Buffet!).</P>
<P>"Shrek" has good lessons for kids and humor targetted at every age group
in the family.  While it may be derivative of the 1987's "The Princess Bride,"
"Shrek" addresses a new generation with similar sensibilities and doesn't
suffer in the comparison.</P>
