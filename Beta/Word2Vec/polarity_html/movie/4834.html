<PRE>                             A MIDWINTER'S TALE
                          (IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Director and Writer Kenneth Branagh's A MIDWINTER'S TALE (called
IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER in Britain) is a wonderful celebration of the
pure joy of acting.  It is full of exuberant energy and literally
bursts at the seams with happiness.  It is a comedy that kept a smile
on my face from start to finish.  Since one of my least favorite movie
genres is comedy especially British comedy as this one is, I was really
surprised at how much I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  My only problem
was that I had to make myself stopping laughing out loud sometimes so
that I would not miss any of the excellent dialog, and this was
sometime extremely difficult.</P>
<P>     Opening to the strains of "Why must the show go on, oh mammy", the
picture tells the story of a director named Joe Harper (Michael
Maloney) who wants to produce and star in a production of Hamlet.  He
auditions actors and actresses for the play, and these auditions are
perhaps the best part of the movie.  The thespians he recruits appear
to be the dregs of the acting world, and each audition is hilarious.
In Tom Newman's (Nicholas Farrell) interview for the part he explains
to Joe that, "Hamlet isn't just Hamlet.  Hamlet is me.  Hamlet is
Bosnia.  Hamlet is the desk.  Hamlet is the air.  Hamlet is my
grandmother."  The actors appear to share a single trait - they are
hungry and need the work badly.  Joe solves the problem by hiring all
of them.</P>
<P>     His "friend, agent, and personal investor" Margaretta D'Arcy (Joan
Collins) arranges for them to do the play in a dying town called Hope,
of which it had little.  They setup shop in an abandoned church that
has been taken over by developers.  They will live there, eat all of
their meals together there, and open the play in a few weeks on
Christmas Eve.  A constant subplot is will they sell any tickets or
will they go bust and be thrown out before opening night.</P>
<P>     The best part of the film other than the script and the directing
is Michael Maloney's acting.  He is so infectiously happy and naive
that you begin to feel sorry for him since the actors he has to work
with are the pits.  Eventually they will become a team and more than
that a family, and it is this considerable camaraderie that gives the
audience such a warm feeling of joy.</P>
<P>     Nina Raymond (Julia Sawalha), who plays Ophelia, is not optimistic
on their chances of getting kids out on Christmas Eve to see Hamlet.
She asks, what are we going to tell them, "Hello kids, do stop watching
The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and see a four hundred year old play
about depressed aristocrats."  I nearly fell over in my seat when she
delivered that line.</P>
<P>     All of Joe's happiness finally begins to crumble when opening
night draws nigh and the play is not coming together.  His emotions
explode, and he tells the cast, "Hamlet is a loser led by the chief
loser, yours truly."  Branagh creates Joe as a director with whom the
audience easily empathizes.  You want such an incredibly energetic,
albeit naive, guy to succeed no matter how small the odds.</P>
<P>     After initial bickering, the cast finally comes together.  When
Joe's sister Molly (Hetta Charnley) is worried about forgetting her
lines, Carnforth (Gerard Horan) advises her to do what he always does.
He tells her, "If I forget my lines in Shakespeare, I always say,
'crouch we here a while' and wait."</P>
<P>     The casts thinks the set decorator is named Vag (Celia Imrie).
Carnforth tells her he is glad she uses her nickname.  She then
corrects them telling them that her name is Fadge.  She lets Molly call
her Pher, which Molly says she appreciates but that Pher is even harder
to say than Fadge.  Fadge is a great quirky little character who keeps
the cast guessing as to what the set will look like.  Eventually they
come to believe she is such a minimalist that the set may have no
external manifestations at all.  I will not spoil it by describing what
she decides.  It is major funny.</P>
<P>     The cast in the show is great from top to bottom.  I can only
scratch the surface with this review.  As well as the ones above, there
is Henry (Richard Briers), Vernon (Mark Hadfield),  Nancy (Jennifer
Saunders), Terry (John Sessions), Tim (James White), and Mortimer
(Robert Hines) among others.</P>
<P>     The movie is filmed in a low contrast and a little hazy black and
white by Roger Lanser.  I thought this look worked very well with the
material.  The sets by Tim Harvey and the costumes by Caroline Harris
are suitably hokey.</P>
<P>     A MIDWINTER'S TALE flies by at 1:39 thanks to crisp editing by
Neil Farrell.  It is incorrectly rated R for a tiny bit of bad
language.  There is no sex, nudity, or violence of any kind.  I would
class the film as a mild PG-13 and would have no trouble taking a kid
of any age who was genuinely interested in the theater to it.  This is
an energetic, funny, but not slapstick comedy.  It makes you feel good
to be alive and reminds you what is special about the acting
profession.  I recommend it to everyone highly and award it *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
