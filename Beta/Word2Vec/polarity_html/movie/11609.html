Troyes)

MPAA rating: Not Rate
Review: *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>Uncompromising French director Robert Bresson's "Lancelot of the Lake"
achieves the exact opposite effect of Sir Thomas Malory's "Morte
Darthur." Instead of enshrining the legend of King Arthur and his
Knights of the Round Table, it dethrones them by revealing Arthur as a
weak, ineffectual leader and the Knights as a group of jealous,
bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them.
Chivalry has no place in "Lancelot of the Lake," except as that of a
dying ideal.</P>
<P>Bresson begins his tale as the Knights of the Round Table are returning,
decimated, after failing Merlin's command to retrieve the Holy Grail,
the mystical cup that was filled with Christ's blood. Bresson
immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the
Grail quest: bloodshed and failure. The opening sequence is a series of
clumsy, disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked
off, a stomach is impaled, a skull is split open, skeletal remains hang
from trees, and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house.</P>
<P>Since the film starts with Camelot in near-ruin, and takes only an hour
and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion, it doesn't carry the
grand, tragic resonance of other Arthurian films. We never get to see
Camelot at the peak of its power, therefore there is no real downfall to
witness.</P>
<P>But, then again, it is not the name of Camelot that is evoked in the
title of the film. Rather, it is Lancelot, and Bresson is more
interested in the internal battle within his heart, than the external
downfall of a kingdom. Lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the
Arthurian tales, and Bresson uses him as the central figure to explore
the battle between the spirit and the flesh. The greatest of all
knights, he was flawed only in his love for Arthur's wife, Queen
Guinevere, and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the
downfall of Camelot.</P>
<P>Even when Lancelot attempts to end the affair with Guinevere (Laura Duke
Condominas), he only finds himself falling back into her arms against
his better judgment. He knows it means the destruction of the idealized
kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion. When Sir Mordred (Patrick
Bernhard) accuses Lancelot of the affair, other knights, including Sir
Gawain (Humbert Balsan) spring to Lancelot's defense. It is this battle
within the Knights that is the eventual undoing of the Round Table; the
flesh wins out over the spirit, and the consequences are dire.</P>
<P>Bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the
interiors of men's hearts and minds. "Lancelot of the Lake" is filled
with his particular trademarks: a stripped-down, minimalist style, flat,
expressionless dialogue, and a grand use of natural sounds in place of
music. He uses background music only twice in the film, during an
opening narration segment and during the opening credits. The music here
is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes, but the rest of the film
is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic
elements: the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor, the
neighing of horses, the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads, and
the natural chirping and whispering of the forest.</P>
<P>Like most of his other films, Bresson employed nonprofessional actors
who recite the dialogue in emotionless, flat voices. All the actors he
used in "Lancelot of the Lake" had never acted before, and with the
exception of Patrick Bernhard, they never acted again. Never once do
they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word. Instead of
using vocal inflection, Bresson strove to create emotion through images.</P>
<P>In some ways, this technique works; in other ways, it doesn't. The final
montage of Arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous, and the
final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal
scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment. However, other times
Bresson's uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable. For
instance, during an important jousting contest, Bresson films the
majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses'
legs. He does this repeatedly, opening each shot with the same few notes
from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag. While there might be
symbolic value in this, the resulting experience of watching it can be
bothersome.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, "Lancelot of the Lake" is a fascinating cinematic
experience boldly made by a master filmmaker. Bresson's style may not be
for everyone, but one has to respect his strength as an artist. By
re-evaluating the Arthurian legends and making them his own, he turns
"Lancelot of the Lake" into something rare in modern cinema: a truly
personal film.</P>
