<PRE>CROUPIER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is a cool operator who naively thinks that he
always has everything under control.  Mike Hodges's CROUPIER, based on a
sharply written script by Paul Mayersberg, centers around Jack and his
alter ego, Jake.  Jack is a writer who has taken a job as a casino
dealer ("croupier" in British parlance) in order to get some exciting
source material for a novel.  The protagonist in Jack's book is Jake,
whom he models on himself, working at his new job.</P>
<P>It is hard to delineate exactly where Jack ends and Jake begins, but the
main difference is that Jack has a strong respect for rules and a belief
in the importance of honesty, whereas Jake has more malleable morals.
The beauty of the script is Jack's constant, third-person voice-over, as
he writes his novel in real-time based on his experiences in the gaming
industry.</P>
<P>Although bearing a passing similarity to REINDEER GAMES, CASINO and
ROUNDERS, CROUPIER's story isn't the least bit derivative.  With a sleek
look and feel, the movie has stylish atmospherics and a detached
approach that is a far cry from the typical in-your-face Hollywood
production.  The characters are intriguing, but they never feel the need
to beg you to like them or to insult you to get you emotionally hooked.
The intricate plot doesn't require any knowledge whatsoever of gambling,
and such insight information might be a detriment anyway, causing you to
pay too much attention to uninteresting minutia.</P>
<P>The ever-present voice-over by a dour protagonist is reminiscent of John
Cusack's part in HIGH FIDELITY.  As it is in HIGH FIDELITY, it is the
best part of CROUPIER.  ("A feeling of elation came over him," Jack says
of Jake.  "He was hooked again watching people lose money.")</P>
<P>But whereas HIGH FIDELITY is definitely a comedy, CROUPIER is sort of a
thriller.  More than anything it is a character study with some nice
little twists involving disreputable punters (gamblers), croupiers and
casino managers.</P>
<P>CROUPIER does has some humorous moments with perhaps the best being a
brief bit concerning another author working for Jack's publisher.  This
author, being a terrorist rather than a croupier, recently wrote a
successful "kill-and-tell book."</P>
<P>The women in Jack and Jake's lives -- Marion (Gina McKee), his live-in
girlfriend, Bella (Kate Hardie), a street-smart, fellow croupier, and
Jani (Alex Kingston), a mysterious and romantic punter -- lure them one
way and then another.  These twists form key parts of the labyrinthine
plot, but the enjoyment is in observing them more than in anticipating
where they are leading.  In CROUPIER, the journey itself is truly the
reward.</P>
<P>CROUPIER runs a fast 1:31.  The film is unrated but would be an R for
sexuality, language, dope smoking, brief nudity, some violence and adult
themes.  It would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
