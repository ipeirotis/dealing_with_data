<PRE>                               GUARDING TESS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Nicolas Cage, Shirley MacLaine.
Screenplay:  Hugh Wilson and Peter Torokvei.
Director:  Hugh Wilson.</P>
<P>     I mean no condescension when I say that GUARDING TESS is the kind
of movie that my grandparents would love.  They see about a movie per
year, if that, and when they do choose to plunk down their $7.00 a
piece they tend to opt for something light and frothy, usually one of
those comedies featuring two decent but strong-willed characters who
spar but obviously care about each other.  These films are always good
for a few smiles, and are generally inoffensive.  Intellectually, I
understand the appeal of such once- in-a-blue-moon-night-on-the-town
entertainments, and some of them do give the character interaction
zing.  GUARDING TESS isn't one of them.  It's just two pleasant,
well-acted characters with nothing to do.</P>
<P>     GUARDING TESS has been the assignment for the past three years for
Secret Service agent Doug Chesnic (Nicolas Cage).  Tess is Tess
Carlisle (Shirley MacLaine), an irrascible widowed former First Lady,
beloved by the public but held in a slightly different regard by those
close to her.  Doug has just completed his three years, much to his
delight, when he is informed that Tess has personally asked the
President to keep Doug on the detail.  It is with reluctance that Doug
returns to guard Tess, and the two find themselves perpetually at odds
as Doug insists on doing everything by the book.  When tensions boil
over, both become aware of an underlying respect that grows into an
unlikely friendship.</P>
<P>     GUARDING TESS owes every ounce of charm it displays to the very
engaging lead performances of Nicolas Cage and Shirley MacLaine.  Cage
often seems to have only two gears on screen--frantic and manic--but
here he des a surprisingly restrained turn as the frustrated agent.  He
is appropriately humorless about a job Doug takes very seriously, yet
he doesn't go for wooden.  MacLaine, who seems to get every role in
Hollywood written for a woman over 50, has mastered the flinty dame bit
by now, while always managing to leave a bit of softness around the
edges.  Tess is not a particular stretch for MacLaine, but she never
mails in a performance.  The interaction between Doug and Tess in the
film's first half hour is amusing in a low-key way, never degenerating
into over-the-top theatrics.  At almost every stage the relationship
seems completely natural, and that relationship makes for some
entertaining scenes.</P>
<P>     What torpedoes GUARDING TESS is the sense that director and
co-writer Hugh Wilson didn't really know what to do with these two
characters.  Wilson's most notable previous contribution to film has
been the POLICE ACADEMY series, but he did create the popular TV sitcom
"WKRP in Cincinnati" and the critically acclaimed but short-lived
"Frank's Place."  Since Wilson's greatest success has come on the small
screen, it should come as no surprise that GUARDING TESS feels a lot
like a pilot for a series.  The characters are established, but the
plot is nearly non-existent.  Very quickly, GUARDING TESS begins to
repeat itself, with too many redundant scenes of Doug and Tess butting
heads, Tess winning and Doug fuming.  It's a film that just floats
around like a hovercraft on a layer of niceness.</P>
<P>     Then, when Wilson finally seems to realize the need for a second
plot point, he creates an utterly ridiculous subplot involving a
kidnapping.  I have this feeling the conclusion we see was not his
first choice.  There is a silly red herring involving Tess's son which
I suspect was not a red herring in some earlier incarnation, because
the revelation of who the kidnappers are inspires a big "what?"  I also
believe Wilson might have considered a slightly darker resolution, but
was concerned about ruining all the good will he had worked so hard to
generate.  The result is just grossly out of touch with the rest of the
movie anyway.</P>
<P>     Fluffy and inconsequential doesn't have to mean tedious.  GUARDING
TESS might make a fine bargain matinee for someone seeking a chuckle or
two.  At least that's what I'd tell my grandparents.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Secret Service agents:  5.</PRE>
