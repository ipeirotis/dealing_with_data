<P>HURLYBURLY (director: Anthony Drazen; screenwriter: David Rabe;
cinematographer: Gu Changwei; cast: Sean Penn (Eddie), Kevin Spacey
(Mickey), Robin Wright Penn (Darlene), Chazz Palminteri (Phil), Garry
Shandling (Artie), Anna Paquin (Donna), Meg Ryan (Bonnie), 1998)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This glib talk-fest is based on David Rabe's 1984 misanthropic play
about friends caught in the web of Hollywood hype. What sparkles through
the two hours of its production is the magnificent ensemble cast, who
are able to make the superficial lives they are portraying seem colorful
and their story worth telling. Eddie (Sean Penn) is the hollow casting
director who lives in a Hollywood Hills luxury condominium with his
business partner Mickey (Kevin Spacey); Chazz Palminteri is cast as a
second-rate actor and violently unstable ex-con; and, Artie (Shandling)
is their sleazy friend, a big shot in a Hollywood studio who acts as
their respected confidante.</P>
<P>Donna (Anna Paquin) is a vacuous teen-age hitchhiker that Artie brings
back to their pad so that the boys could use her as a sex pet, and she
in return gets a free place to sleep. Darlene (Robin Wright Penn) is the
dispassionate sexual interest of Mickey, but the chilling love-life of
Eddie. After dating Eddie, she has sex with the suave Mickey, who makes
a pretentiously gallant gesture of returning her to Eddie, saying his
friendship means more to him than she does. Bonnie (Meg Ryan) is the
good-hearted stripper who freely has sex with those she wants to; one of
her most inglorious moments, she says, is when she had fellatio in a car
while her 6-year-old daughter is in the backseat traumatized by what she
sees. If the movie reaches a climax of any relevance, it is because of
her disastrous date with Phil, where he loses it and throws her out of
her moving car.</P>
<P>The opposite sex relationships are all disasterous and difficult to
comprehend, as the film goes overboard on dumping on all the female
leads, leaving no room for them to be anything but the objects of the
men's failures and desires.</P>
<P>These four unlikable men indulge us with how they prey on the weak.
Their constant need to talk and say nothing pursues them every moment of
their day. Cell phone conversations and empty self-righteous discourses
trying to explain what they are about and what trouble they are in
continues seamlessly from scene to scene. These men are not just
materialists and users of people, but are truly depraved human beings.</P>
<P>Eddie, as the central figure of the story, is probably the one who is
the most out of it, either because of his heavy cocaine sniffing or his
tremendous vanity or his inability to know the difference between what
is real and what is false. When Artie brings the sex-crazed Donna for
him to keep in his house as a CARE package, he pounces on her,
indifferent to her as he is with everyone else he knows. The only
difference is, that when he is with his friends he pretends to listen to
them.</P>
<P>Because of the sharp dialogue and the ability of the actors to get under
the skin of their characters, this morbid look at humanity seems
poignant. Its humor is in the form of sarcasm and scorn, which is a
mean-spirited way to look at others, though Mickey says he is flip not
sarcastic. His retorts and dry comebacks are flip humor used in the
sense that we are all going under, so why be that serious about life!
When Eddie asks him, "What kind of friendship is this?" He responds, "An
adequate one." He is the one who seems to be above the fray, never
getting himself dirtied by the group.</P>
<P>The most significant relationship is between Eddie and Phil; it was also
the oddest one and the most sycophantic. Eddie's closeness with Phil is
based on lies and a false sense of need one has for the other. It is
ruptured when Eddie finally tells him with cruel honesty, we need guys
like you in Hollywood to make the bullshit look real. You're expendable.
You do not matter.</P>
<P>This is not a great drama as much as it is a black comedy that has great
acting and intriguing dialogue. There are no break throughs in character
that can explain misfits like these guys, who assume power positions and
misuse the trust society has in them. Dominance and establishing their
place in the pecking order is what motivates them. They compete against
each other because of their jealousy and hatred of the other. Even a
long lasting relationship between Eddie and Phil can't be viewed as
necessarily a sincere one. Mickey tries to tell Eddie this when he
mentions how cold his relationship with Phil is. "Phil is very safe,
because no matter how far you manage to fall, Phil will be lower."</P>
<P>As an interesting gesture to the media age of the 1980s, Drazen uses the
TV images we view from the channel-changing Eddie, showing how
meaningless and bland everything seems on the screen: tragedies, wars
and football games are all manufactured as significant events by the
media but all meld into insignificance in one's daily life, with no
follow-up search for the truth in these stories taking place. This is
analagous to the lives of the male-bonding friends, who make small gains
upon seeing something about themselves reported by others, but fail to
search inward to see what they really are all about.</P>
<P>This was a tough film to like and an even tougher film to hate. Its
appeal is hypnotic, in the sense that we are overhearing conversations
we shouldn't be hearing but we can't stop listening to them. If we met
these types in our personal lives, more than likely, we couldn't stand
to be around them long enough to be sufficiently entertained by them.
For two hours to see them on film is also too long to be around them. An
80-to-90 minute film, honed down and made more mobile, taking away some
of its staginess, would have suited me just fine.</P>
