<PRE>                                 TOMMY BOY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Chris Farley, David Spade, Bo Derek, Julie Warner,
           Brian Dennehy, Dan Aykroyd.
Screenplay:  Terry Turner & Bonnie Turner.
Director:  Peter Segal.</P>
<P>     If there is a development in recent popular culture more
depressing than the degeneration of "Saturday Night Live" into a
weekly televised car wreck, it is the proliferation of equally
pungent big screen projects featuring current and alumni SNL cast
members.  These films have primarily been wrong-headed attempts to
turn a five minute sketch into a ninety-minute movie (IT'S PAT,
CONEHEADS) or self-indulgent star vehicles for annoying stars
(OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS, BILLY MADISON).  That is why it comes as such a
complete shock that TOMMY BOY is funny, and not just sporadically.
It is an ideal vehicle for Chris Farley and David Spade that falls
flat only when it mistakenly tries to be warm and fuzzy.</P>
<P>     Farley plays Thomas "Tommy" Callahan III, a big good-natured
doofus who has finally graduated from college after seven years.
Fortunately, his dad Big Tom Callahan (Brian Dennehy) owns an auto
parts company, and plans to have Tommy Boy follow him in running the
family business.  That opportunity comes sooner than expected when
Big Tom dies on the day of his wedding to Beverly (Bo Derek),
leaving behind a business in financial trouble.  In an attempt to
save Callahan Auto Parts, Tommy goes on the road with Richard Hayden
(David Spade), his dad's sarcastic right hand man, to sell
Callahan's new state-of-the-art brake pad to retailers.  If Tommy
Boy can't learn to be a great salesman, Callahan will be sold to a
competitor (Dan Aykroyd)--which would suit Beverly and her "son"
Paul (an uncredited Rob Lowe) just fine.</P>
<P>     What separates TOMMY BOY from other SNL cast projects is that
it looks like someone actually sat down and tried to figure out how
Chris Farley and David Spade could best be used.  It turns out that
they are a nearly ideal pairing as a comic team.  An hour and a half
of nothing but Farley's pratfalls and manic outbursts would have
been intolerable; ditto for Spade's snottier-than-thou put-downs.
Indeed, both of their comic personae are very individual tastes, and
those who are irritated by either or both of them might not find
much to like in TOMMY BOY.  But for some reason, Farley and Spade
complement each other very well:  Farley does something really
stupid, and Spade makes an acerbic comment.  That's the basic
formula, repeated with variations on the content and context.  And
most of the time, it's good for a solid laugh.</P>
<P>     That is largely because screenwriters Terry and Bonnie Turner
(THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE) come up with some inspired situations within
the routine plot.  There are a few hilarious scenes of Farley and
Spade bonding over cheesy songs on the radio, including The
Carpenters' "Superstar" and the Spanish language ballad "Eres Tu."
Another highlight has the portly Farley trying to change clothes in
an airplane restroom, cleverly directed by Peter Segal (NAKED GUN
33-1/3).  Sure there are more than a few clunkers, as well as a
completely unnecessary and un-funny scene centered around
masturbation, but far more of the jokes are dead on.</P>
<P>     TOMMY BOY's biggest lapses come when silly plot contrivances
draw the focus away from the two stars.  There is an obligatory
romantic interest for Farley in the woefully under-used Julie Warner
as a spunky employee at Callahan's, but it is about as tacked-on as
a sub-plot could be.  Farley's villainous step-family is also pretty
boring for the most part, although it is a kick to see Bo Derek
again after over a decade, and Rob Lowe may have discovered a new
career as a camp villain after this film and the first WAYNE'S
WORLD.  The attempts to play up the close relationship between Tommy
Boy and his father are also well-intentioned but distracting.
Basically, any time the makers of TOMMY BOY try too hard to be
anything but funny, it doesn't work.  When they try to be funny, it
does.  The current writing crew of "Saturday Night Live" might
consider giving TOMMY BOY a good look.  They could stand to learn a
thing or two.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 auto parts:  7.</PRE>
