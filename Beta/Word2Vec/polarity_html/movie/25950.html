<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A further vulgarization of Shakespeare's most vulgar play that succeeds
in going over the top and losing its sensibilities without adding
anything worthwhile to take the place of what was lost, yet it is not
without its positives. This early tragedy written by the young bard is
also his weakest and most turbulent play, casting out dramatical
dimensions, poetry, and pity in favor of gore. It is a difficult one to
come to terms with, except to see it for its dark humor and parody.
Julie Taymor (theater-version of Disney's "The Lion King"), the female
director/writer, who put this elaborate production on as an experimental
off-Broadway play, films it as a revenge story that has a surreal look
of time travel to it (a grandson of Titus' is playing soldiers on the
kitchen table when Titus marches in from ancient Rome and shows him what
happened back then), while also playing up the contemporary political
intrigues in Rome with those of ancient Rome, thereby pointing out how
little we have learned from the past. She also highlights the darkened
hearts of all who seek revenge for their hurts and gleefully shows how
they get this revenge, doing it in a campy way.</P>
<P>Anthony Hopkins plays Titus with the same kitsch he played Hannibal
Lecter, but without the same results. Unfortunately, for him, this was a
different picture and his overacting grew wearisome. The film was also
overlong at 162 minutes, without having a sufficient reason for being
that long.</P>
<P>Titus returns from conquering the Goths, but paying the heavy price of
having 21 of his sons killed in battle, with only 4 remaining. He brings
back the loser's empress, Tamora (Lange), and her three sons as
captives. Titus, despite the mother's pleas for mercy, slays her eldest
son Alarbus and throws him in the fire as revenge for the death of his
sons, but spares her and the two other sons, Chiron (Jonathan Rhys
Meyers) and Demetrius (Matthew Rhys). Mother, tattooed and clad in gold
lame and matching gold breastplates, whispers to her remaining sons of
revenge.</P>
<P>The new emperor crowned is Saturnius (Cumming). He is the unpopular son
of the last emperor but has the reluctant blessing of Titus -- who turns
down the mobs' cries for him to be crowned. Cumming's plays his role as
an insecure, campy effete, prancing about as a puff, coifed in an Adolph
Hitler hairstyle, as he aims to steal every scene by his gyrations and
petulant looks. Lange's idea for a hurt queen, is to seethe like a snake
throughout, while Hopkins is the loyal general to Rome who is betrayed
by politics, loudly spitting his lines out as if he were saying the most
urgent things for the world to hear, as the film goes back and forth
between a child dropped into ancient Rome Alice in Wonderland-style,
showing the lifestyle from the decadent Fascist Italy of Il Duce, and
viewing the tribulations during ancient Roman times. It all seems glossy
and avant-garde, but surprisingly, the film is most faithful to
Shakespeare's text.</P>
<P>When Saturnius surprises Titus by choosing his daughter Lavinia (Fraser)
as his queen, her promised husband Bassianus (Frain) reacts by
kidnapping her from the emperor, with the help of Titus's sons. Titus
feels he has been disgraced in Rome and slays his youngest son, showing
his allegiance to Rome over family. But with the loss of Lavinia,
Saturnius is attracted to the pagan goddess Tamora and marries her
instead, but does not forgive Titus's sons for their kidnapping.</P>
<P>Tamora soon gets her revenge on Titus. Marcus (Feore), Titus's brother,
finds Lavinia looking like a scarecrow in the field, after being
brutally raped and mutilated with Tamora's approval, as her boys cut out
her tongue and cut off her limbs. The evil Moor Aaron (Lennix), Tamora's
lover, plays Saturnius off against Titus, spitefully orchestrating the
vengeful deceptions. After Bassianus is murdered and two of Titus's sons
are trapped in a hole in the woods, the Moor delivers the message to
Titus that the emperor requires the hand of Lucius as revenge, and he
will free the trapped sons. Titus gladly has his hand chopped off by
Aaron as payment, but instead of his sons being returned, the heads of
his sons are chopped off and returned by messenger, as Aaron betrayed
him to the emperor and told him it was Titus's hand not his sons.
Lucius, the remaining son is banished from Rome, and joins the Goths to
attack Rome.</P>
<P>The morbid humor comes about as Titus gets his revenge and reverts from
being simply a warrior to a philosopher, carrying his woes inside him
like he does his broken heart for Rome and for his family. He will serve
meat pies to the unsuspecting Tamora, who eats them and reacts with
horror when told what she just ate were her sons' body parts. Titus will
then slit her throat with the appetite of a psychopath, smacking his
lips with delight as his chef's hat bobs up and down. The emperor's fate
is also sealed in a similar manner.</P>
<P>Not every work by Shakespeare has to be great, even though, if the bard
wrote it, there has to be something there. This one suffers from
worldliness, hollowness, and from having no point to it; I doubt if any
screenplay could rescue it from its banality of violence. Julie Taymor's
version was a good costumed effort to show the violence for all that it
is, but in the process making it into a campy Grand Guignol production.
On a more serious note, she also shows the following: that racial hatred
begets more hatred on the part of the Moor, the links to Saturnius with
modern Fascism are obvious ones, that debauchery by the pagan queen
leads to a society where children grow up without values, like her sons
who act as sociopaths on a speed trip; and, finally, there is the
madness of Titus to consider, the film's protagonist, who kills children
-- his own and others. The only hope for the future is in the children,
a young Lucius who must learn to become less hateful and the bastard son
of Aaron, who must get past his father's blistering racial bitterness.
But I found it all coming together too artificially. It was an art-house
film, way too fluffy to serve the film's dramatic efforts, as it all
seemed like a Fellini rip-off, taking the subtlety out of Shakespeare's
work for all the excesses engendered.</P>
