<P>     Angela Pope's HOLLOW REED is one of the most striking, forceful
films to emerge onto the American art house scene so far this year, but,
like many powerful motion pictures, it can be extremely difficult to
watch.  In examining how the physical abuse of a child affects an
already-broken family, HOLLOW REED doesn't pull any punches, literally
or figuratively.  And, while the beatings aren't as graphic or brutal as
those in another recent domestic violence motion picture, ONCE WERE
WARRIORS, they're all the more wrenching because, in this case, the
victim is a ten year old boy.</P>
<P>     Yet, if HOLLOW REED's sole subject matter had been child abuse, it
wouldn't have been as provocative or challenging.  In crafting this
film, however, Pope and her screenwriter, Paula Milne, have followed an
ambitious agenda -- expose the multi-faceted pain of domestic violence
and show how the courts discriminate against gay men in any custody
battle.  Lawyers and judges can mouth polite platitudes about how
sympathetic they are to the plight of homosexuals and how everyone has
the right to do what they want "in the privacy of their own bedroom,"
but, when it comes to handing over a child into the custody of a gay
father, the deep-rooted ugliness of homophobia rears its head.  Equality
is a word that everyone loves to speak, but, in today's world, there are
times when it remains a distant fantasy.</P>
<P>     Part of the reason that HOLLOW REED is so punishing is that it's
told from a child's point-of-view.  That child is Oliver (Sam Bould), a
quiet, introverted boy who seems to be the perfect son and student. 
He's a STAR WARS fan, and spends hours in his room playing with Luke
Skywalker action figures and remote-controlled cars.  His parents are
divorced, and their relationship is far from amicable.  Oliver lives
with his mother, Hannah (Joely Richardson), and her boyfriend, Frank
(Jason Flemyng).  Meanwhile, Oliver's father, Martyn (Martin Donovan),
an out-of-the-closet homosexual who shares a home with his lover, Tom
(Ian Hart), has only the right of "reasonable access" to his son. </P>
<P>     The film opens with Oliver arriving at his father's door late one
evening with a bleeding, bruised face.  Although Oliver claims that he
was beaten up by a group of local thugs, Martyn has his doubts.  Days
later, when the boy shows up at school with a crushed hand, Martyn goes
to the police, requesting that they investigate whether Frank has been
abusing his son.  He then instigates a custody lawsuit, with the
intention of taking Oliver away from Hannah if she doesn't kick Frank
out.  And, as the case goes before a judge, all sorts of ugly truths
about society's perception of homosexuals are unveiled.</P>
<P>     Relating the story from Oliver's perspective allows us to better
understand the fear, confusion, and self-blame that the child
experiences.  Physical damage isn't the only byproduct of abuse; it has
deep-reaching psychological ramifications as well, the effects of which
can be far more lasting.  Oliver's reasons for not telling are complex,
and HOLLOW REED makes his silence on the subject seem completely
rational under the circumstances.  Oliver loves both of his parents, so
we see them in a sympathetic light.  Understandably, he doesn't like
Frank, but, while the movie casts him in the role of the villain, it
manages to humanize him to a degree, offering a motivation for his
actions.  The easy route would have been to present Frank as a sadistic,
faceless monster; Pope rejects that cliched path.</P>
<P>     As Oliver's situation becomes more precarious and a legal
resolution remains hanging in limbo (the courts want to investigate
further, and Oliver's stubborn silence robs Martyn of his only witness),
frustration grows.  Desperate to appear "clean" to the court, Martyn
asks Tom to move out, then reconsiders when he realizes the hypocrisy of
that desire.  He also considers illegally abducting Oliver and going on
the run.  His impotence ratchets up the level of tension that Pope works
so hard to create.  HOLLOW REED isn't meant to be a thriller, but the
tone is darker and more ominous than is typical for a drama.</P>
<P>     Both Martin Donovan and Joely Richardson do fine jobs as Oliver's
parents.  Richardson (Disney's live-action 101 DALMATIANS) arguably has
the more difficult role playing the torn woman who doesn't want to
believe a horrible truth that is becoming increasingly more evident. 
Oliver's silence allows her to remain in blissful denial. Donovan, a Hal
Hartley favorite, portrays a man who, despite having the moral high
ground, is powerless to save his son.  The key to Donovan's performance
is that it starts out low-key.  That way, as the situation becomes
increasingly desperate, he never seems over-the-top.  However, all of
the adults, including Richardson, Donovan, and the fine supporting cast,
are outacted by young Sam Bould, who captures the essence of Oliver
without a hint of the confusion and awkwardness that sometimes marks
child performances.  Bould has many memorable moments -- hiding under a
work bench so that Frank won't find him, preparing to defend himself
with a chisel, and bravely enduring the punishment that Frank dishes
out.</P>
<P>     What starts out as a "simple" tale of child abuse widens into a
damning expose of the essential hypocrisy of a "civilized" society --
how certain, "normal" wrongs are tolerated.  To save his son, will
Martyn have to live a lie?  And, if he remains true to himself, will
that continue to place Oliver at risk?  In life, there are no easy
answers, and HOLLOW REED is nothing if not an accurate mirror of
reality.  This is not the sort of motion picture that's likely to find
favor with the "feel good" crowd, but, if you aren't afraid of a movie
that is capable of challenging convictions and wrenching emotions,
HOLLOW REED makes for an unforgettable two hours.</P>
