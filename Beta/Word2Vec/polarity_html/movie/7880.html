<PRE>                                  THE VAN
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Some countries seem to specialize in certain movie genres.  As the
entire world knows, America can make special effects blockbusters like
no other country.  Then again, few countries can afford to bankroll
such risky ventures.</P>
<P>     For low key, working class comedies full of droll humor, few
countries can equal the Irish.  Novelist and screenwriter Roddy Doyle
can be placed in the center of contemporary Irish writers.  THE VAN is
based on the last of his Barrytown trilogy.  The first two novels were
made into the well received movies, THE COMMITMENTS and THE SNAPPER.
(Look on the back of the fish 'n chips and burger van in THE VAN, and
you'll see "Beware The Snapper" as a little in-joke to remind the
audience of the last movie while also poking fun at the merchandise.)</P>
<P>     "Got a bit of bad news today," says Bimbo at the pub to his old
buddy Larry.  "Let go.  Been made redundant."  Larry can empathize with
him since he's been out of work for years -- on the dole as they say.</P>
<P>     Keeping busy is hard for these middle age men, but they are
willing to try anything including golf in the pouring rain while
pushing around a rain gear covered toddler.</P>
<P>     Donal O'Kelly plays Bimbo, the more serious of the two.  Bimbo
does not find being out of work as easy to take as his more jovial
companion Larry, played by Colm Meaney from the other films in the
trilogy as well as CON AIR.  Together the two of them craft a good
spirited comedy.  Although it turns somewhat bittersweet towards the
end, the chemistry between them hums like a smooth running and happy
little engine.  Their story is rarely exciting, but always congenial.</P>
<P>     Director Stephen Frears (DANGEROUS LIAISIONS) has the good sense
to never try to make the movie more than it is, a small tale of two
friends coping through some troublesome times.  It is in the minutia,
which he handles with such a deft touch, that the show has its charm.
Larry feels his family needs to economize but isn't even willing to
substitute chicken for turkey for the Christmas dinner.  He asks
rhetorically, "What's Christmas without a turkey?"   (The beauty and
the challenge of the film is the thick Irish accents.  "Turkey" becomes
a long, involved, and particularly melodious word.)</P>
<P>     One of their friends offers to sell Bimbo a derelict fast food
van.  Larry's wife, Maggie (Ger Ryan), takes one look at the beat-up
wreck, caked in grime, and asks the seller, "What about the engine?"
Surprised, he shoots back, "What engine would that be Maggie?"  Yes,
the lack of a motor is one of its many deficiencies.  Figuring they can
pull it with their car, Bimbo buys it and gets Larry to be his partner.
"Bimbo's Burgers," they name it.  ("Bimbo" apparently does not have the
same connotation on their side of the Atlantic.)</P>
<P>     Except for one outlandish episode where a accidentally fried nappy
(which we Americans call a diaper) is sold as fried fish, most of the
humor is so understated that it rarely elicits more than a small giggle
from the audience.  This lack of any substantial laughs in a comedy
will probably be its downfall.  Those used to broad comedy with
slapstick humor are likely to be disappointed by this subtle story.
But those willing to cut it a little slack, will find our two unlikely
heroes quite appealing.</P>
<P>     Most of the show has to do with the trials and tribulations of
running a small business in which they have no experience.  (Since they
must move the van to locations where people will buy their products,
Maggie wonders, "Do heavy metalers eat chips?"  It turns out they do,
but they have other attributes that make them less than ideal
customers.)</P>
<P>     The beautiful cinematography by Oliver Stapleton, who did the
stunning work in RESTORATION, comes alive in the night sequences.  The
warm glow of the incandescent light of the interior of the van at night
makes Larry's and Bimbo's business somehow magical.</P>
<P>     The show ends abruptly.  Several scenes which you are convinced
are just around the corner, never occur.  Like a dream, the writer lets
each of us decide how we want it to turn out.  The visual at the
conclusion is the picture's best, and one worth savoring.</P>
<P>     THE VAN runs 1:36 but feels shorter.  It is rated R for constant
use of the F word.  (Larry's family has a "swear fund" jar, which is
unrealistically small.)  The film would be fine for teenagers.  I
recommend this little picture to you and give it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
