<P>IDIOTERNE (director: Lars von Trier; cast: Bodil Jørgensen (Karen), Jens
Albinus (Stoffer), Anne Louise Hassing (Susanne), Troels Lyby (Henrik),
Nikolaj Lie Kaas (Jeppe), Henrik Prip (Ped), Luis Mesonero (Miguel),
Louise Mieritz (Josephine), Knud Romer Jorgensen  (Axel), Katrine
Michelsen (Nana), Anders Hove (Josephine's Father), 1998-Denmark)</P>
<P>This is the first film made under the label of Dogma, a Scandinavian
film group inspired by the Danish director von Trier, which insists that
their new manifesto on how to make films, be adhered to by those who
make films under their label.</P>
<P>This dogma consists of improvised acting and hand-held camera work,
among other dogmas the film must adhere to. It reminds me most of  how
Godard filmed during his Mao stage, but without the apparent overt
political messages, as Godard's films during the late 60s were anti-film
films, replete with diatribes against the bourgeoisie, which seemed
filled with the director's hubris and self-congratulation on his
political stance, that he was right and others wrong in their beliefs,
and his rather tiresome political cliches, that seemed to be more
opportunistic than spontaneous, even though every attempt was to make
the film appear as if they were spontaneous.</P>
<P>Trier has a bunch of middle-class cult groupies living together in a
rich private house that one of their relatives gave them, as the group
members seem to be either in their late teens or their 20s, whose
repulsive purpose is to freak out in public and sometimes do it when
together in the privacy of their house. To spasse, is a Danish term,
which refers to those who act like idiots even though they are not.
These episodes of spassing give this film an odd look that is guaranteed
to turn off a lot people and anger many, especially those who expect
more conventional ways of looking at the problems young people face in
society.</P>
<P>The theme of the movie is certainly obnoxious, it is very difficult to
feel much of anything for these middle-class drop-outs, as we first
encounter them in action in an elegant restaurant and watch them spasse,
retardedly eating their food, under the direction of one of them
(Susanne), who pretends to be their keeper, while one of them, Stoffer,
grabs on to a lady (Karen), sitting alone, and refuses to let go of her.
Karen seems to be responding kindly to the idiot, just like she didn't
react with any ill emotion after being treated rather brusquely by the
waiter when she told him she doesn't have much money and will be just
ordering the salad. The group leaves together with Karen and tells her
it is just a game they enjoy playing, inviting her to join them, even
though she does not appear like they do, but she does look desperate and
lonely and unhappy, and might benefit from hanging around with such
idiots as they are.</P>
<P>They do another spassing in a Rockwood furniture factory, which was more
stupid than humorous and belabored any point that was trying to be made
about workers in a factory or about  middle-class values, it was goofy
in a way to watch them operate, as it seemed to be similar to the way
that fraternities might find their inane initiation rites uplifting to
their older members who already went through the initiation process to
join the group, but to outsiders it would seem like they were seeing a
bunch of spoiled children.</P>
<P>In another public spassing, Jeppe is left by the one playing his keeper
(Stoffer), with a burly looking bunch of tattooed, beer guzzling biker
types, who are asked to mind him for ten minutes, after they notice
Jeppe staring at their tattoos, while the keeper goes to the other part
of the bar. Again, it was not funny, but yet, it was curiously
interesting, in a prurient kind of way to see what the interaction was
going to be between these two groups of outcasts.</P>
<P>The most controversial part of the film is the sex orgy among the group
members, acting as idiots, and actually seeming to copulate on camera
(porno stars were used to do the sex), sort of giving the film a mock
documentary feel to it, as the orgy members smear caviar all over their
faces, and try to unbend from the middle-class environment they all came
out of. The tenderest love making was between the teenager Josephine and
the older Jeppe, who really seemed to be falling for each other, but
could only do it under the cover of being idiots. Soon Josephine's
father would embarrass her by coming to the group's home and removing
her from the home.</P>
<P>The film moved into the gist of the filmmaker's message when Stoffer,
the leader of the group, decided he would spin a bottle and whomever was
chosen would have to spasse in front of family members or those they
previously worked with. Axel and Henrik could not do it and thereby left
the group. What was becoming increasingly clear was that the game was
almost over for all of them, that they couldn't really confront the
idiot inside themselves, that it was becoming apparent to them, that it
was just a temporary game they were playing, perhaps, in an experimental
phase of their young life.</P>
<P>I think the point that von Trier was trying to make, is that you really
have to be an idiot to change the system, or think that you can change
it, but that you can only be effective when you really confront who you
are, reaching past the point of where authority rules who you are; or
else, you are stuck with the same cultural values you have always had
and can't really change who you have been brought up as. Being an idiot
is the last act of despair. It is an act of courage. And it only matters
when you can do it for real and not be using it to play a game. For von
Trier, being an idiot is an endearing way at looking at someone acting
out who he is, in order to initiate change in the system.</P>
<P>Karen's story now unfolds; and, she turns out to be the one with the
most dramatic thing to tell about her life. She volunteers to go back
home to do her spassing with Susanne as her witness. We meet her family,
who act cold towards her, asking her where she has been for the last two
weeks, and wondering why she didn't go to her baby's funeral. We meet
her husband, who shows her no love, and then we see her spasse on her
cream cake after dinner, acting as her baby might have acted when eating
the cake, and she gets slapped by her husband and leaves the house with
Susanne, who is filled with genuine tears. The trauma for her has
reached a point of no return, and the very dangers of spassing or
regressing back to one's childhood to find a way of dealing with a
society you are antagonistic to, seems frought with extreme personal
dangers, and the possiblity of a psychosis developing looms over all the
young people's heads.</P>
<P>Trier has made his point. He has won me over. This very unusual personal
film, that is very difficult to warm up to, that mocks what is
conventionally thought of as right, by doing what is unconscionable and
politically incorrect, becomes only too real and too sad to comprehend,
as it is presented so as not to give us a way out in our perception of
how to deal with the alienation the youngsters feel, as they seem to be
left with only their naive hopes and disillusionments; and possibly,
their emotional experiences that they can value. Their situation is not
resolved. The film does not end with all loose ends tied up in a nice
bow. We can't even be sure how long their commune life will continue,
and how soon it is that they will find themselves out in the cold world,
alone again, as misfits, where some of them will fit in without too much
trouble but will be living a lie; and, where others will find it very
difficult to go back to being middle-class, and will always be restless
in such a society. But they tried something... and whether they reached
their inner-self or not, something penetrated them, whether they are the
better for this experience, is difficult to tell, but something
significant to them did take place, just as we in the audience, whether
we liked the film or not, something inside us was moved by what we saw
taking place, causing us to react in a way we might not normally act
when watching a film; and, in my way of thinking, that is great
filmmaking.</P>
