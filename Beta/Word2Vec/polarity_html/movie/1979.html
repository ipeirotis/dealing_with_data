<P>     Eight-year old Jonah Baldwin (Ross Malinger) misses his mother,
who died eighteen months ago from cancer.  More than that, however, he
recognizes that his father Sam (Tom Hanks) is desperately lonely.  So,
on Christmas Eve, Jonah calls up a radio talk-show psychologist and
asks for help.  Forced onto the phone by his son and identified as
"Sleepless in Seattle," Sam reluctantly (at first) opens up and talks
about his love for his dead wife and the things that made her special.
Across the country in Baltimore, Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) is listening to
the syndicated program, and Sam's testimonial of love brings tears to
her eyes.  Even though she is engaged to Walter (Bill Pullman), Annie
begins to wonder what it would be like to meet Sam, even going so far
as to be one of thousands to write a letter to him.  But when
circumstances conspire to make an assignation possible, the question is
whether either Sam or Annie will have the courage to follow the signs
that fate has shown to them.</P>
<P>     There are those who will claim that SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is too
corny, with sugar-coated cuteness filling in for the lack of a strong
plot.  And, while they have a point, there's something that the cynics
are missing--it's meant to be that way.  By its own admission, this
film is intended to be a throwback to the screen romances of the past
(AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER in particular, which is cited numerous times,
and borrowed from explicitly and implicitly).  Anyone going to see
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE expecting a tale of stark modern life has walked
into the wrong theater.  This is a timeless, dreamy fantasy whose mood
falls somewhere between magic and reality.</P>
<P>     Coincidence is the backbone of Nora Ephron's story, wending its
way through the plot with uncanny repetitiveness.  Skillfully, however,
the script turns to its advantage what could have been a major
hindrance to the audience's suspension of disbelief.  The concept of
destiny is an important element to all that transpires.  At the
beginning of the film, Annie is a realist who dismisses the idea of a
supernatural sign as nothing more than a random occurrence.  By the end
of SLEEPLESS, she has become a firm believer in fate.  Considering the
unusual nature of the bond she develops with Sam, how could she not?</P>
<P>     While this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, especially amidst the
burgeoning tide of action/adventure summer fare, it is not without
flaws.  The character of Walter, although nicely played by Bill
Pullman, is superfluous.  His inclusion is meant to say something about
Annie's life and personality but, as the movie progresses, he becomes
more of a hindrance and annoyance than an asset.  His purpose is never
clearly delineated and the too-neat resolution of this subplot is
lacking in believability.</P>
<P>     Then there's Annie's family.  The dinner scene with them near the
beginning of the movie is pointless, with the attempts at humor coming
across as weak and unfunny.  Little of value is revealed about any
character.  Apparently what we're supposed to learn is how quirky
Annie's relatives are and how this has impacted on her personality, but
the way the scene is played, the result is only partially achieved.
It's not that this part of the movie is unpleasant, but it doesn't seem
to belong, and the cutting-room floor might have been a more
appropriate place for it to reside.</P>
<P>     The ending is a little abrupt, but not in a bad sense.  It's
usually a positive trait of a film to keep the audience hungry at the
conclusion.  We want to see a little more--perhaps just a crumb to
nibble on--even though it's clear that the story has reached its
natural conclusion.  More often than not, as is the case in SLEEPLESS,
this is an indication that the characters have been well-defined and
deftly portrayed.</P>
<P>     Tom Hanks, who is frequently chosen for parts that demand energy
and verve, does an excellent job in a subdued role.  It's easy enough
to make the widower into a cliche, but Mr. Hanks' heartfelt
performance, combined with an intelligent script, have avoided that.
Instead of a person lifted from stock, we are given a man we can accept
and whose grief we can sympathize with.</P>
<P>     Meg Ryan has a less challenging role and, compared to what she did
in PRELUDE TO A KISS (where she had to play the old man in a young
woman's body), there's nothing noteworthy about what she does.  She's a
likable actress who is fine for the part, but she has far fewer
"moments" than Mr. Hanks.</P>
<P>     The supporting actors are effective.  Rosie O'Donnell and newcomer
Ross Malinger manage to steal their share of scenes.  Bill Pullman,
despite being saddled with a poorly-developed character, manages to
make an impression (sort of like in NEWSIES).  Rob Reiner and Rita
Wilson (Tom Hanks' real-life wife) have small parts.</P>
<P>     SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE has been billed as a "romantic comedy," but
the accent is more on romance than humor.  Comic moments are kept to a
minimum, and there are only a couple of openly funny scenes (one
involves a comparison of "male" and "female" movies--AN AFFAIR TO
REMEMBER versus THE DIRTY DOZEN).  Subtle humor abounds, but it's the
kind that normal people encounter in everyday life, more often worthy
of a chuckle than outright laughter.</P>
<P>     As an antidote to the summer doldrums and an alternative to
dinosaurs, rock-climbing, and last action heroes, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE
is perfect.  While lacking the unfettered charm and exuberance of
Kenneth Branagh's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, this film is enjoyable in its
own right, not to mention more easily accessible.  Lovers will probably
enjoy this a fraction better than singles, but there's more than enough
in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE to cause the edges of just about everyone's
lips to curl upwards.</P>
<P>     Oh, one more gripe.  Brooks Robinson, while unquestionably a great
baseball player, is not (as this film claims) the lone choice for best
third baseman of all time.  Of equal, if not greater, stature is a man
by the name of Mike Schmidt.</P>
