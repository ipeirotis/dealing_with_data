<PRE>                                  SILENT FALL
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Richard Dreyfuss, Liv Tyler, J. T. Walsh, Ben Faulkner,
Linda Hamilton, John Lithgow.
Screenplay:  Akiva Goldsman.
Director:  Bruce Beresford.</P>
<P>     If you have not already done so, please add to your list of movie
cliches the "psychiatrist/psychologist who is as screwed up as anyone
he/she is treating."  While some might argue (and suicide statistics
might support) that this is a case of art imitating life, it is
becoming far too predictable to toss a psychiatrist with personal
demons into a suspense plot as flavoring; they are the MSG of the
psychological thriller.  Surely there's a happy, well- adjusted shrink
out there somewhere.  Well, not in SILENT FALL, and the inclusion of
that tired standby is just one of the many, many things wrong with this
good-looking but gimmicky thriller.</P>
<P>     The psychiatrist is Dr. Jake Rainer (Richard Dreyfuss), an expert
in autism who has given up his treatment of children in the wake of a
patient's death.  He is called in by the local sheriff (J. T. Walsh)
when the only witness to the murder of a prominent couple appears to be
their autistic son Tim (Ben Faulkner).  With the assistance of Tim's
sister Sylvie (Liv Tyler), Jake attempts to reconstruct what happened
the night of the murders before Tim is turned over to a less
compassionate psychiatrist (John Lithgow) for more radical treatment.
Their best shot:  Tim's uncanny ability to remember and mimic
conversations.</P>
<P>     I don't think I'm breaking any new ground when I say that Richard
Dreyfuss, talented though he may be, is a ham.  And if there is
anything more unintentionally amusing than watching a ham act, it is
watching him try desperately *not* to be a ham.  In SILENT FALL,
director Bruce Beresford has Dreyfuss wandering around in a daze of
what is supposed to be self-pity, but instead looks mostly like a
particularly bad Hamlet.  In the one scene where Dreyfuss plays
Dreyfuss, rattling off multiple voices in an attempt to calm Tim, it's
almost a relief.  Unfortunately, that is the level at which Beresford
has everyone pitch the performances; you only know they're alive
because they blink.  Linda Hamilton, energetic star of the TERMINATOR
films, has the appallingly under-written role of Jake's
oh-so-supportive wife, who struggles with dialogue like, "You're the
one hiding from the world, Jake."  Liv Tyler (daughter of Aerosmith's
Steven Tyler in her first major role) is lovely, but lacks any screen
presence, and her big emotional scenes are truly laughable.  From start
to finish, SILENT FALL is just so sluggish that I felt I was being
hypnotized.</P>
<P>     It's even harder to stay awake once you realize the preposterous
story that you are being asked to swallow.  First of all, no one from
social services ever appears to guard Tim's interests, allowing the
sheriff to treat him like a narcotics dog, expected to sniff out the
murderer.  Tim and Sylvie are allowed to return to their house,
disturbing a crime scene of an investigation in progress.  Most
ridiculous of all is Tim's special talent, and not so much because it's
impossible to believe his tape-recorder memory.  Rather, it is the
mimicked voices dubbed over Tim's lips which cross the line into
silliness, and every time they are used they just get sillier.</P>
<P>     Of course, a fundamental problem with SILENT FALL is that it's a
mystery where everyone seems too stupid to figure out the obvious.
Ultimately there are only three suspects in SILENT FALL, and it tips
its hand far too soon.  What pass for attempts at diverting attention
from the only real suspect fail miserably, and SILENT FALL is left to
fall back on the developing relationship between Jake and Tim for any
drama.  While there are moments in that relationship which work quite
well, they lead to the film's single most infuriating scene, a miracle
cure for Tim at a crucial moment.  For a film that wants to appear
serious in its treatment of a perplexing medical condition, it traffics
in solutions which are far too pat, and acts as a slap in the face to
everyone who has ever had to live with autistic individuals by
suggesting that all it takes to bring them out of it is just a little
more love.  And maybe the violent death of one or two family members.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 miracle cures:  2.</PRE>
