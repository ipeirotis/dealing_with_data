<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Ghost Dog is the seventh feature film, of arguably America's most
innovative and underrated director, Jim Jarmusch. I consider it a shame
that one of America's best directors had to get European backers for
this film and still receives a better reception abroad than he does in
his own country. He has created an almost masterpiece about the
influence of an ancient way of life has for a black man wrestling with
the present culture by meditating every day on the meaning of death by
considering himself a dead man. He has become a hit man, so he could
honor the samurai code by respecting solely a small-time middle-aged
Italian Mafia soldier, Louie (John Tormey), who saved his life eight
years ago when two white ruffians were going to kill him. The Ghost Dog
is a huge black man (Forest Whitaker), prone to wearing a hooded
sweatshirt, who lives in the inner city streets of Jersey City, on a
rooftop shack, where he maintains a carrier pigeon coop and spends his
time alone in silence like a monk, studying an 18th century book
Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai by Yamamoto Tsunetomo, whose excerpts
from the text appear periodically on the screen, to be read aloud by him
to explain the scene that is to follow according to the way an ancient
warrior steeped in Buddhist lore might see it.</P>
<P>Ghost Dog gets his assignments only via carrier pigeon from Louie and
follows the exact orders issued. Here, he is asked to hit a made
gangster called Handsome Frank (Richard Portnow) who has been fooling
around with the crime boss's mentally disturbed daughter, Louise Vargo
(Tricia Vessey). When Ghost Dog goes to the job, he plays rap music on
the car CD to keep alert and when there, he quietly enters the apartment
expecting to see only the intended victim, as the girlfriend he was told
was put on a bus. But the crime boss's daughter has returned without him
being aware of it and lounges on a chair, having just finished reading a
translation of Ryunosuke Akutagawa's Rashomon and then tossing it on the
floor. She is dressed in a red negligee and has a Betty Boop hair-do.
Handsome Frank is watching a Betty Boop cartoon on TV, as Ghost Dog
takes aim and fires away at him. After the killing, Louise indifferently
asks, "If he was sent by her father," as Ghost Dog reacts silently to
her presence. She then says in a low voice, "You can have it. I'm
finished with it." He quickly takes the book and withdraws.</P>
<P>The Mafia chieftains, all geriatrics, meet in the back of a Chinese
take-out restaurant, which they use as their clubhouse. They are so
unsuccessful in what they do, that they have trouble making the rent
payments for this dump. They sit around a table and tell the
slobbish-looking Louie and his underling Vinny (Victor Argo) that they
are disturbed with the hit because the girl was present. A secondary
boss, who distinguishes himself as a lover of rap music, Sonny (Cliff
Gorman), then orders Louie to murder Ghost Dog, telling him that
Handsome Frank was one of us. When Louie flinches, he says it is better
than if we murder you. The crime boss (Henry Silva) looks as if he could
be brain dead, as he impassively asks who the hit man was, in a
particularly monotone voice, and when they find out that Louie doesn't
know his real name or where he lives, that he pays him for the hits once
a year on the first day of the autumn and that their only contact is by
carrier pigeon, and on top of that, he's a black man. This becomes too
much for the fragile elderly consigliere (Gene Ruffini) to hear, as he
utters his first words on the screen in a machine-like unnatural voice,
by making vulgar remarks about the hit man's race, and the meeting
breaks up with a plan to get Ghost Dog. There is comedy here in the
absurdity of the situation even though no one cracks a joke. It doesn't
make sense that these Mafia bosses want to kill their contract killer,
especially since it was an untraceable hit. But, one of the points of
the story, is that things that happen don't necessarily make sense, they
just happen.</P>
<P>The most innocent encounter Ghost Dog has occurs on a park bench, where
a young black school girl, Pearline (Camille Winbush), strikes up a
conversation with him, as she recognizes him as an odd character who
lives in the neighborhood. They get around to talking about books, as
she takes out her bookbag and shows him she is reading Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein, as both agree the book is better than the movie. Reading
books is readily accepted by both parties as something that is cool.
Ghost Dog lays Rashomon on her, saying he just finished reading it and
only asks that when she finishes, she should let him know what she
thinks of it. When the girl says to him that everyone says he has no
friends, he takes her to meet the black Haitian ice cream vendor (Isaach
de Bankole) in the park, who speaks only in French, a language Ghost Dog
doesn't speak; but, even though they can't understand the other's
language, he explains to her, that they are still best friends and they
are still able to communicate with each other. The assumption is that
they both have soul and can talk the black man's rap. The girl and the
Haitian show their true human feelings toward the samurai warrior and
seem to understand something about him that is vital without being able
to comprehend him.</P>
<P>Ghost Dog prepares for all-out warfare from the mob, with the idea Louie
must be protected at all times because of the samurai code. He sends the
big boss a bewildering quotation from the Hagakure via pigeon, about
beheading and the boss is the only one of the aging Mafia present in the
room to respond, by saying, "It's poetry-the poetry of war."</P>
<P>The most artificial scene in the film, that seems to be too forced to
work effectively, comes after he finishes picking off the mobsters in
their country hideaway and spots on a country road a pair of redneck
camouflaged hunters with darkened faces who have just shot a black bear
for no reason except to kill it. It seems odd that Ghost Dog, after his
wholesale butchery of the mobsters, can take the high moral ground and
think that he has the right to take the law into his own hands against
these wayward hunters and execute them, even if he equates them with
racists and from his ecclectic reading and his discussion with his
Haitian friend, has a belief that bears in ancient civilizations were
considered equal to humans, and therefore what the hunters did was
tantamount to a crime.</P>
<P>The film is much influenced by Jean-Pierre Melville's stylized 1967
gangster masterpiece Le Samurai, which also quotes an ancient Japanese
ideology that influenced its hero, though in that film, it is from the
Book of Bushido, which is a fictional work. Ghost Dog remains for the
most part a parody of other movie characters. The film is influenced by
the gangster film genres, Japanese, black, and Italian cultures, the
present pop culture, the spirit of how the African-American had to
reinvent himself in the American cities, and how an unheralded
Italian-American mobster and an unheralded black samurai of "different
ancient tribes" can act with mutual respect for each other despite their
differences.</P>
<P>The film is slow-paced due to the stoppage to read from the excerpts
from the Hagakure texts by Whitaker. Its rhythm is further broken up by
attempts to link pop culture, rap music, cartoons, fancy cars stolen in
the dead of night, and the ugliness of the city streets with the lessons
that can be passed on from a different time that must be reinvented to
fit every new generation. The movie gets its fast-beat to counter the
slow-pace of the film from the hip-hop music of RZA (pronounced
RIZZ-ah), that fits coolly into the nighttime moods of the depressed
city and gives the monk-like samurai who listens to the music on the
radio's CD, a strange trance-like look of recognition that he is hip to
what is going down around him. It is a movie that is mostly invigorated
by Forest Whitaker's stunning performance of a man who is an icon, who
lives by myth alone, whose most memorable statement, is that "The end is
important in all things."</P>
<P>The most glaring error Ghost Dog makes, is in his strictly literal
interpretation of what he is supposed to do as a samurai warrior. He
mistakeningly takes the message from the book to mean that he must
become subservient to someone who doesn't respect what he believes in.
Buddhism specifically states that no killing is justified, so he seems
to have taken the wrong course of action in this lifetime despite his
belief that he got everything together by reading the book. He would
have saved himself a lot of trouble by putting his energy into trying to
help others, especially his new-found Mafia friend, in other ways than
by reinforcing his already bad karma. That would have been the true way
of a samurai warrior, whose lessons are meant for battle and seem to be
easily misinterpreted by someone living so cut off from human contact
and without the benefit of a teacher.</P>
<P>Jarmusch has in all his films displayed an interest of seeing how
another culture looks at the American culture, having already shown how
Hungarians, Native Americans, and Japanese react to seeing America. It
now seems to be the turn of the black man, as this film is basically
about the Forest Whitaker character making peace with who he is, and
showing that to be an American, it takes more than one culture to
influence you, whether it's the Mafia men absorbed by cartoons or rap
music or poetry, or the director himself, influenced to be a so-called
"hip" White Negro. For Jarmusch, America is an exotic place where
different cultures uniquely flourish in the most unexpected spots.</P>
<P>The shining points of the film come from the moving cinematography of
Robby Muller, the
 minimalist mise-en-scène, the splendid expressive performance by Forest
Whitaker, the underlying humor, and the freshness of Jarmusch's approach
to filmmaking, proving that he is someone willing to take chances. There
are critics who constantly rave about less cutting-edge films more than
do about ones that are not afraid to mess with set-concepts. For this
film, they offer mostly faint and lefthanded praises. As for me, I'll
take my chances with heaping praise on a Jarmusch near-miss like this
one, over so many other forgettable praiseworthy hits that are so
limited in scope.</P>
<P>Jarmusch's first language is poetry and it is my belief that this film
is as close to a lyrical masterpiece as a film can be without being one.
Its weakest point being a lack of character development for the Mafia
figures, as the Mafia characters were more cartoonish than real, they
seemed to be created to fit a certain standard mold rather than to be
developed out of their own personalities. But that flaw, was also what
drove the film comically, therefore making that weakness more palatable
and understandable.</P>
<P>This film is similar in mood to his other ambitious work, which was a
masterpiece, Dead Man, and it is one that makes so many fine points to
justify its wide range of themes. It is foolish to try and tightly
categorize it, except to say that even though it is not exactly a
mainstream film, neither is it primarily an art-house film. It just
might be one of those intriguing films that requires an acquired taste
and once acquired, leaves no doubt about how good it is, no matter that
there are a few things in it that might be considered tasteless.</P>
