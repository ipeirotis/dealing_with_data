<P>     THE FRIGHTENERS isn't a bad film, but it is a disappointment.  
Following director Peter Jackson's powerful, true-life matricide tale, 
HEAVENLY CREATURES, THE FRIGHTENERS falls short of expectations by being 
just one of many in the long line of 1996 summer movies.  It's driven by 
some pretty nifty special effects, but the characters are fairly 
lifeless, and the plot, when it makes sense, is silly and needlessly 
convoluted.  As horror-comedies go, this one doesn't offer much that's 
original or daring.  Jackson's past efforts, such as BRAINDEAD and MEET 
THE FEEBLES, have taken more chances, and THE FRIGHTENERS doesn't match 
the audacity of Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD movies or even this year's 
CEMETERY MAN.  </P>
<P>     It's not hard to pinpoint what's wrong with THE FRIGHTENERS.  The 
storyline is extremely confused, and there's no big payoff.  The 
proceedings meander along, throwing jokes, dripping ectoplasm, 
unnecessary characters, and pointless action sequences at the audience, 
until they rather suddenly come to an end.  There's no big buildup to a 
final confrontation, nor is there any real sense of anticipation 
regarding the climax.  The script is unpolished, and often feels more 
like a draft than a finished product.</P>
<P>     THE FRIGHTENERS opens with a solid premise.  Frank Bannister 
(Michael J. Fox) is a paranormal investigator operating in the small 
town of Fairweather, California.  Bannister is a con artist, but his 
accomplices are unusual -- a trio of ghoulish spirits named Stuart (Jim 
Fyfe), Cyrus (Chi McBride), and the Judge (John Astin).  Because, even 
though Bannister is a fraud, he really can see, communicate, and 
interact with the dead.  Bannister has a simple arrangement with his 
associates.  Stuart, Cyrus, and the Judge haunt a house, then Bannister 
shows up to do an exorcism -- for a fee, of course.  </P>
<P>     But, when a local doctor, Lucy Lynsky (Trini Alvarado, from LITTLE 
WOMEN), loses her husband, both the dead and the living of Fairweather 
have cause to be worried. Victims all over town are dying of sudden 
heart attacks, and only Bannister knows the cause. Cloaked and armed 
with a scythe, the Grim Reaper (a.k.a. the "Soul Catcher") has arrived, 
connected somehow to the spirit of an executed serial killer.  When 
Bannister sets out to end the massacre, he finds that the living are 
impotent against Death.  Lucy believes in him, but, when he's arrested 
on suspicion of murder and she is marked as the Soul Catcher's next 
target, there's not much she can do to save Bannister or herself. </P>
<P>     THE FRIGHTENERS includes some enjoyable, and potentially 
interesting, elements, none of which are given enough exposure to do 
them  justice.  Bannister's interaction with his ghostly con partners 
could have made for an enjoyable film on its own; here, it's part of the 
setup.  Then there's the idea that the protagonist might have to kill 
himself to do battle with the Soul Collector on its own turf.  Again, 
the possibility is only toyed with, not fully realized.  At times, it's 
frustrating to watch THE FRIGHTENERS, because the seeds of a good story 
are there, struggling to get out.</P>
<P>     That said, the movie held my attention for its one-hundred ten 
minute running time.  It's lighthearted and paced like a runaway train, 
and some of the gore-and-humor mix works.  The special effects, which 
were done exclusively by a New Zealand company, are as impressive as 
anything produced by ILM.  THE FRIGHTENERS isn't as eye popping as 
TWISTER or INDEPENDENCE DAY, but it functions as a nice piece of visual 
candy.  Michael J. Fox does a better-than-adequate job in the lead role, 
and he and Trini Alvarado display a nice rapport, even if their romantic 
relationship remains underdeveloped. </P>
<P>     THE FRIGHTENERS is about as mixed a bag as you can get.  The 
muddled story is a serious drawback, as are the host of unnecessary 
characters and subplots.  A nutcase FBI goon (Jeffrey Combs) and a loony 
agoraphobic woman (Dee Wallace Stone) irritated me; every time they 
appeared, I wanted them to go away.  The former, although supposedly on 
hand for comic relief, was a little too creepy to be funny, and the 
latter was critical only to an unnecessary plot twist.  Essentially, 
neither was needed, and THE FRIGHTENERS would have been better without 
them.</P>
<P>     If there's one obvious aspect of this movie that recalls HEAVENLY 
CREATURES, it's that Jackson once again plumbs the depths of his 
imagination.  Next time out (possibly for his rumored re-make of KING 
KONG), if he can wed that creativity with a substantive, less convoluted 
story, he should be able to regain the form that catapulted him to 
international acclaim last year.</P>
