<PRE>METROPOLITAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Writer and director Whit Stillman, who manages to raise
shallowness among rich, white kids to an art form, started the first of
his famous trilogy in 1990 with METROPOLITAN.  In his first film the
kids refer to themselves, derogatorily, as preppies, but by the last
picture, THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO, they have been rechristened yuppies,
even if none of them will admit to being one.  (For the record, the
middle picture is BARCELONA, and my personal favorite is THE LAST DAYS
OF DISCO.)</P>
<P>     Stillman films, with their acerbic humor, are perhaps best on the
second and third viewing.  With their rapid-fire approach and their
subtle dialog, it is easy to miss many of the lines the first time
around.  Subsequent looks are also helpful since one of the failings of
Stillman's casting and his costuming is that most of the actors look
alike and, to a lesser extent, so do the actresses.  It may be halfway
through before the audience learns to tell them all apart.</P>
<P>     METROPOLITAN, we are told in the credits, is set in "Manhattan.
Xmas Vacation. Not so long ago."  A dilettante group of debutantes and
their collective beaus are meeting for one of the many private parties
during the social season.  After the official balls, they gather to
make small talk about large issues and generally gossip among
themselves.  They argue the fine points of 19th century socialism,
while living a life of absolute luxury.  They are all elitists, united
in their agreement that they hate pretentious people and that they
certainly aren't ones themselves.</P>
<P>     Although they are cynical to varying degrees, none is more so than
Nick Smith, played as the perfect rich snob by Christopher Eigeman, who
has starred in all three of Stillman's films.  While others worry about
the possibility of failure, he plans on it, and, with his lack of
ambition, it seems likely.  "I've always planned to be a failure
anyway, that's why I plan to marry an extremely wealthy woman," he
announces to no one's surprise.</P>
<P>     The odd man out is their resident radical, Tom Townsend (Edward
Clements), who is the only one without independently wealthy parents
and the only one in - aghast! - a rented tux.  Tom, not very
convincingly, goes on and on discussing his worries about the
downtrodden in life, which upsets Nick.  "It's a tiny bit arrogant of
people to go around worrying about those less fortunate," Nick royally
declares.</P>
<P>     Audrey Rouget (Carolyn Farina) has her eyes set on Tom, who pines
instead for the extremely popular and unobtainable Serena Slocum (Ellia
Thompson).  Tom ridicules Audrey for liking Jane Austen's Mansfield
Park.  He points out that, even though he's never read it, it is
universally agreed to be a mediocre book.  "You don't have to read a
book to have an opinion," he argues.  He goes on to say that he doesn't
read any novels but prefers to read literary criticism instead.  "That
way you get both the novelists' ideas as well as the critics'
thinking," he reasons.</P>
<P>     "Playing strip poker with an exhibitionist somehow takes the
challenge out of it," Nick complains after one of the women throws a
hand so she can take off another item of her clothing.  As they slowly
undress, they alternatively talk about trust funds and class struggles,
but Stillman cuts away before the scene gets the least bit risque.</P>
<P>     Using dreamy jazz music in the scene transitions, Stillman makes
the story go down as smoothly as a white wine.  His characters may get
on your nerves sometimes, but he remains hopelessly in love with them
and all of their foibles.  Like all his movies, METROPOLITAN has the
stagy talkiness of a play, but a fascinating one.</P>
<P>     The story's only serious scene occurs when the group plays a game
of truth, in which the loser must answer any question, no matter how
embarrassing.  "People see the harm in what excessive candor can do,"
Audrey argues correctly, knowing that someone could get hurt and that
that someone could be her.</P>
<P>     When one of their ranks, Jane Clark (Allison Parisi), dares to go
out on a date alone, the rest are dumbstruck.  Used to nothing but
group social activities, they worry that their lifestyles are changing
forever.</P>
<P>     As in THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO, in which the leads lament disco's
demise, the characters in METROPOLITAN figure that this may be the last
season for debutante balls and the end of an era.  "Men are dates, date
substitutes or potential dates," Fred Neff (Bryan Leder) complains of
their new world order.  "I find that dehumanizing."</P>
<P>     METROPOLITAN runs 1:38.  It is rated PG-13 for some profanity and
for adult themes, and it would be fine for teenagers.</P>
