<P>There are some pretty impressive stars in LOST IN SPACE - it's just that none
of them happen to be actors. The stars I'm referring to are the computer
generated ones that make up the movie's "outer space"; the stars that the less
impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home. Yes, in
terms of acting, the star power is . . . well, more like a falling star. Kinda
pretty, short-lived, and pretty much dead.</P>
<P>LOST IN SPACE, as if you really didn't know, is based on the 60's sci-fi
television series of the same name. It's the year 2058, and Earth's precious
resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population.
John Robinson (William Hurt) is the scientist leading a mission program to
colonize a foreign planet. Earth's entire existance is contingent upon a
successful mission, but nobody, whether it be John's family or hired battle
pilot Don West (Matt LeBlanc), seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home
planet for several years. John's family consists of his wife Maureen (Mimi
Rogers), his atypical teenage daughter Penny (Lacey Chabert), his ingenious
son Will (Jack Johnson), and his beautiful scientist daughter Judy (Heather
Graham). Despite everyone's reluctance, the Jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons
planet Earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space.</P>
<P>Unknown to anyone but the audience, there is an evil doctor stowaway
determined to sabotage the entire mission. Dr. Smith (Gary Oldman) has been
hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour, and Dr.
Smith has re-programmed a talking robot to "destroy Robinson family"! When
everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides, the spaceship is
warped to an unknown destination, and now the premise of being lost in space
is complete. As for the audience, you will likely be lost in boredom by this
point, wondering if the plot, like the Jupiter 2, will ever get off the
ground. It's hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland
and corny characters or the horrifically lame script? Chabert is basically the
only one to overdo it, sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium. If you, like
me, were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of
plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens, you're wrong! That's
just her normal voice!</P>
<P>In yet another example of a "Friend" faltering on the big screen, LeBlanc is
so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly
charming (make sense?), it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod
corridor without an escape pod. Graham is a babe - thank goodness there was
something for me to think about during this film. Hurt, the black hole of
excitement, sucks up any energy that might have been left. If Hurt were
available in tablet form, he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill.
Johnson isn't dull, he's just lame as the young know it all who winds up
saving everybody's ass all the time. Want an example of how cool this kid can
be? How about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and
reconsider killing the family? Hey, don't laugh - the thing actually listened
to the Mr. Rogers-would-be-proud sentiment. But alas, if you thought a
character couldn't be much worse, there was Rogers as the epitome of generic
(or, mother as she was known). Why hire an actress? They could've had a white
cardboard cutout with the word MOM printed on it. Now that would've had some
pizzazz!</P>
<P>LOST IN SPACE luckily doesn't suffer in every single category that it could
have. The special effects are crisp, clear, and at least mildly captivating,
unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be Oldman, who plays his evil
character with a great deal of fun and finesse. Unfortunately, Oldman is
locked away for most of the film, giving us nothing but ample mocking
opportunities to enjoy. While the special effects are pleasing to the eye,
they are nothing you couldn't find in most modern sci-fi films. CONTACT, for
example, far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination.</P>
<P>LOST IN SPACE just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of
cinematic art, with numerous contradictions (the time travel aspect was
horribly flawed!), wooden and corny acting, worse dialogue, and an ending so
disappointing, you'd be happier to have seen the entire Robinson family get
blown to smithereens. Then again, with an ending like this film has, it's
obvious a sequel is already being considered. What an awful note to end on,
knowing there could be more of this in a year or two. The attempt to be family
oriented is commendable, but LOST IN SPACE is lost with the illusion that
special effects and the nostalgia of a classic TV series being revisited is
enough to satisfy all age groups. Well, danger potential movie goers! Danger!
This movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of
mediocrity.</P>
