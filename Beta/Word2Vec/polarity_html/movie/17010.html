<P>     Hollywood has always been obsessed with youth, but that obsession
finally appears to be spinning out of control.  In these halcyon days of
'N Sync, "Dawson's Creek" and the like, it now seems that you can sell any
pitch in Hollywood by naming a piece of source material and tagging on the
phrase "...but with teenagers."  The most recent wave may have started
with CLUELESS ("Jane Austen's _Emma_, but with teenagers"), and has since
generated such classics as THE FACULTY ("THE THING, but with teenagers")
and SHE'S ALL THAT ("PYGMALION, but with teenagers").  So why not CRUEL
INTENTIONS?  Why not "DANGEROUS LIAISONS, but with teenagers?"</P>
<P>     Because it's a really lousy idea, that's why, made even worse by
appalling execution.  The principle players are Sebastian Valmont (Ryan
Phillippe) and Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Manhattan
step-siblings who are birds of a poisonous feather.  Sebastian delights in
deflowering innocents and building his reputation as a cad; Kathryn seeks
vengeance on a sweet young thing named Cecile (Selma Blair) who
unwittingly stole away her boyfriend.  United in their disdain for all
other feeling human beings, Sebastian and Kathryn strike a wager.  It
involves Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon), a teen who has published a
national magazine article trumpeting her virginity.  Sebastian's mission
is to seize that virtue or risk losing his classic car.  If he wins, his
next conquest will be his own step-sister.</P>
<P>     If that all sounds considerably sleazier than the original DANGEROUS
LIAISONS, that's only because it is.  Writer/director Roger Kumble plays
most of the film as though it's soft-core porn for teenyboppers, teasing
with pseudo-incestuous fondling and money-shot close-ups of Gellar and
Blair tongue kissing.  To make matters even more unpleasant, Kumble even
plays an interracial relationship for titillation value, and goes for
cheap laughs by introducing a pointless subplot in which a stud athlete
(Eric Mabius) is a closet homosexual, complete with gratuitous slurs.  In
a depressing case of lowest common denominator film-making, Kumble has
appealed to his teen audience by reducing the themes of "Les Liaisons
Dangereuses" to "everyone has sex with everyone else."</P>
<P>     In an even more depressing development, Kumble may actually have the
_best_ grasp of the source material.  Ryan Phillippe, in a valiant but
grossly misguided effort to do some acting, spends virtually the entire
film aping John Malkovich's performance in Stephen Frears' 1988 DANGEROUS
LIAISONS.  Every inflectionless line reading, every arched eybrow, every
lascivious double-entendre is familiar, with no apparent adjustment for
the fact that Sebastian is a contemporary teenager instead of an 18th
century nobleman.  Gellar is only a bit better in the lip-curling Glenn
Close role, while Selma Blair plays Cecile not as simple and innocent, but
with a fumbling idiocy that makes her every moment on screen unbearable.
Only Reese Witherspoon brings a shred of dignity to the proceedings,
continuing to show a wonderful presence for a young actress and an
interest in finding something human in her character.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, that's an interest her director doesn't share.  I
suppose it shouldn't be surprising that CRUEL INTENTIONS is just another
in a long line of glossy high school audience flicks, another film with a
mind-numbingly incessant underscore of shuffle-beats and pop songs,
another vehicle for pretty girls and even prettier boys to pose for their
fans.  It is sad, however, that these filmmakers have to keep picking
promising source material for their libretti, then demonstrating no
concern for that material whatsoever.  DANGEROUS LIAISONS was a tale of
corruption beneath a courtly veneer; CRUEL INTENTIONS makes the shocking
suggestion that adolescents can be petty, manipulative and obsessed with
sex.  It's a stupid and pandering film which will probably appeal to its
audience perfectly, leaving the rest of us to sit back and wait for the
inevitable "MOBY DICK, but with teenagers."</P>
