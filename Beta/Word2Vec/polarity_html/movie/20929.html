<P>"When you get out of jail, you can kill him."</P>
<P>Starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones, Bruce Greenwood. Rated R.</P>
<P>Double Jeopardy is a lurid, prepostrous thriller that's also one of the
year's most enjoyable. It's an uncompromisingly brutal, cheerfully
anarchic, hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from
it. There is not a moment here when the events on screen don't have a
direct bearing on the plot; once the film gets going it never stops. It
has been branded as the female version of The Fugitive and that's
probably a correct assessment of the plot, but the film itself has
little in common with the 1993 Andrew Davis/Harrison Ford collaboration
besides the presence of star Tommy Lee Jones.</P>
<P>Not even bothering with character introduction, director Bruce Beresford
floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake. We meet,
rather hastily, Libby and Nick Parsons (Ashley Judd and Bruce Greenwood,
respectively) a seemingly happy married couple, with a son Matty, age 4.
They go out on a sailboat one night, and after a period of some rockin'
sex, they go to sleep. Libby hears a strange noise, wakes up and
discovers that she is covered with blood. She follows a red trail to the
upper deck, where she finds a knife and, out of astonishment, picks it
up. At that convenient moment, the coast guard shows up and Libby is
arrested.</P>
<P>Her lawyer, a friend, puts up a defense in court, but though we know she
is innocent, the evidence against her is too compelling. Her friend
adopts her son and she goes to prison. Once in prison, she makes a phone
call to her friend. Her friend gives her son the phone. Nick walks in
the room. Little Matty screams "Daddy!" The phone goes dead. Libby
realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn't even dead. She
gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer, who tells her that since
the state already convicted her of killing her husband, they can't
convict her of the same crime again, meaning that when she gets paroled
she can kill him and they can't touch her.</P>
<P>After a weirdly short amount of time, she gets out of parole. She is
sent to live at a house with other recent parolees, under the command of
parole officer Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones). She sets out on a
mission to find her husband and get her son back, which turns out to be
much more difficult than anticipated. She winds up tracking him all the
way to New Orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his
girlfriend and her son's "adopter".</P>
<P>Double Jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false. The law
stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes
that it is the same crime: same time, same place, same circumstances.
It's not like it matters. This is a rollickingly good thriller; intense,
exciting, fast and furious. It's silly alright, but this is the kind of
film you just don't question. In some films, plausibility is everything.
Double Jeopardy, however, is not concerned with making sense: its sole
purpose is to entertain, and it does.</P>
<P>Judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role. This is her
breakout box-office performance, and she is terrific. She brings some
emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role, giving the movie
a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set
pieces. Tommy Lee Jones basically just reprises the role for which he
won an Oscar in The Fugitive, but the movie makes good use of his
stone-faced wit. Thankfully, too, Double Jeopardy refrains from
developing a romance between Libby and Travis; a subplot which
doubtlessly would have interfered with the film's story.</P>
<P>This is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys, and I took a
sort of sick pleasure in that. The sheer anarchy of the proceedings was
nothing short of wonderful, as Ashley Judd kicks the crap out of every
authority figure in the book. After all the idealistic Hollywood
features featuring hero cops, deft FBI agents and the virtues of the
American legal system, it's great to see a movie that doesn't so much
demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure.</P>
<P>Double Jeopardy is really good, but it isn't the kind of good that is
remembered or recognized with awards. It's one of those movies better
viewed with the brain turned off, otherwise, your brain will be busy
ruining your experience. This is a thriller that isn't concerned with
being smart or plausible. Instead it diverts all attention to the
action, which, this year, is second to none.</P>
