Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     After a decade as a film critic, Rod Lurie has apparently decided
that not only does he really want to direct, he also really wants to be
President. Lurie made his debut behind the camera earlier this year with
DETERRENCE, a political thriller about the President trying to manage an
international crisis while snowbound in Colorado. The Commander-in-Chief
is once again front and center in THE CONTENDER, suggesting that Lurie may
have been missing his calling as a journalist. Instead of aspiring to be
the next John Ford, he may really be aspiring to be the next John
McLaughlin.</P>
<P>     It's clear that Lurie has a lot of interesting things say about
contemporary American politics on a national level. It's equally clear
that he still has a few things to learn about turning those things into
smoothly satisfying film stories. THE CONTENDER is set sometime in the
near future, during the second term of the Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) 
administration. The sitting Vice President has recently died in office,
leaving Evans with a tough political choice. He wants to name a woman to
the post to secure his legacy, and he wants Ohio Senator Laine Hanson
(Joan Allen) to be that woman. Unfortunately, he faces opposition in the
person of Sheldon Runyon (Gary Oldman), the Congressman who will chair the
confirmation hearings. Runyon is opposed to Hanson's nomination to begin
with, but he finds ammunition for his opposition when evidence appears
suggesting sexual indiscretions from Hanson's youth. And while Runyon
plants the seeds of public suspicion, Hanson refuses to comment on the
issue in any way.</P>
<P>     Questions regarding the pertinence of private life to public service
have certainly been part of the political landscape in recent years,
making THE CONTENDER's subject matter timely food for thought. Lurie
hammers the willingness of politicians to expose every skeleton in an
opponent's closet, and turns Hanson's refusal to comment on the
accusations against her into an expression of contempt for the fact that
the subject has even been raised. Oldman makes for a superb antagonist as
the cutthroat Runyon, whose motivations are always swaying between genuine
conviction that Hanson isn't ready for the job and retribution for earlier
political losses to the President. There are fine moments exploring the
slippery slopes on which politicians walk in order to gain power, none
more effective than a scene in which Hanson -- armed with information that
could allow her to make an effective personal attack on Runyon -- is
forced to decide whether or not to use it. The excruciatingly long silence
in that scene says more about the tension between principle and expedience
than any line of dialogue.</P>
<P>     That's also one of the few moments in THE CONTENDER when Lurie nails
the timing of a scene. Throughout the film, there's a sense that virtually
every scene is about a minute too short, that virtually every character or
sub-plot has been short-changed in some fashion. Crucial relationships --
between Hanson and her father (Philip Baker Hall), a former governor; 
between another potential candidate for the Vice Presidency (William
Petersen) and his ambitious wife -- never develop a rich enough context
for their inclusion to be effective. Hanson herself remains enigmatic
through much of the film, robbing the film of a real protagonist for the
audience to embrace. And Lurie sticks too closely to the insider wheelings
and dealings, never venturing into the realm of public opinion to explore
how scandals affect the public. THE CONTENDER has the scope of an epic
political drama without enough of the detail.</P>
<P>     Fortunately for Lurie, he scores several points for detail with Jeff
Bridges' performance as President Evans. Plenty of actors have essayed
portrayals of American Presidents with an emphasis either on sheer
authoritative presence or flawed humanity. Bridges nails both, switching
from genial charm to icy political determination in the blink of an
eye. He also gets the film's best running joke, as Evans attempts to stump
his kitchen staff with off-beat menu requests. It's a near-perfect piece
of film acting, capturing every one of a modern Chief Executive's many
faces; he even gives a kick to the obligatory climactic preachy-speechy. 
That's the only bit of greatness THE CONTENDER can muster, however; it's
otherwise a merely solid piece of drama. Perhaps next time around, Rod
Lurie will pick up a few lessons from Bridges on putting all the pieces
together around a persuasive ideological core. Such is the stuff of a
great leader, whether behind the camera, or behind the desk in the Oval
Office.</P>
