<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>An enjoyable Monogram made Charlie Chan mystery, with much trickery disguising
who the real culprit is and a very clever premise but one that is not always
well executed. Eccentric, absent-minded inventor Harper (Reicher), is working on
a secret war project for the government where he can harden wood into a metal.
He built a gas chamber to hide his formula plans, as this acts like a spider's
web does where it's easy to get in but not possible to get out. One would get
locked in without knowing the voice password which is activated only by Harper's
voice and would die from either the gas or if having a gas mask would starve to
death from being trapped there. The only two people who know of the chamber and
the password, are Harper and his trusted butler for the last 15 years, Roth
(Delevanti). His assistant, Walter Meeker (Albright), is known for his honesty,
but is still not trusted to know any of the secrets. Meeker, also, expresses an
open displeasure for Harper. </P>
<P>On a night that a motorcycle policeman, Jim Kimball, tries to enter the gated
house and lab of Harper, Roth also reported to Harper an earlier incident of
someone firing a shot on the grounds. Following Harper's request to maintain
secrecy, the cop is not allowed in the house but is allowed to search the
outside grounds. But unknown to the others, the real officer is killed and the
one who kills him puts on his uniform and sneaks into the house. </P>
<P>It's discovered that Harper is missing, and the government considers his work so
vital they assign Charlie Chan the case. Sheriff Mack is already here and will
assist Chan even though he hasn't a clue of what to do. Only the household
guests of Harper are present. It seems that not one of them liked the grouchy
Harper, as his sister Louise Harper (Evanson) readily states. She also worked
there as a housekeeper, hoping to inherit the house and formula rights some day.
His niece is the young and attractive Jean Kent (Warren), who also did housework
there. Stella Graham (Granger) was a former strong lady in vaudeville and a
master puppeteer, who was employed to build a robotic puppet for Harper. Michael
(Dorr), a mute, is employed as a handyman and a chauffeur. </P>
<P>When Harper's body is found on the puppet stage, the autoposy says he died of
natural causes but Charlie shows that it was a poison dart inflicted inside his
mouth. When Jean is the only one who says she didn't see the cop in the house,
Chan becomes suspicious but is satisfied when he learns that she was secretly
dating the cop and Harper never allowed anyone in--so she had to sneak him in
the house. </P>
<P>A few more bodies show up dead, and Charlie himself is almost killed by a poison
dart. Since there is more than one person involved in the murders, they hide the
fact that their victims are dead until they've had time to establish an alibi.
This is accomplished through working the corpses like a puppeteer does the
puppets, therefore it appears as if the dead person is walking. </P>
<P>In the concluding scenes, Lloyd Archer (Ingram) enters the Harper mansion and
proclaims he was cheated out of the formula--that his stepfather Harper stole
the formula from his real father. Meanwhile Charlie deduces from the clues who
the killer and his accomplice are, as all the suspects are gathered in the
living room of the mansion for Chan to solve the case and explain how he did it.
Charlie has the broken ear of a jaded mask, and whomever it fits is the
murderer. </P>
<P>For comedy and for providing more of a hinderance than in helping him solve the
case his Number Four Son, Edward (Edwin Luke), and his chauffeur, Birmingham
Brown (Moreland), come to stay with him at Harper's place. There was a flurry of
one-liners, Confusius-like sayings, and some stereotype racial fright humor by
Moreland exhibited. It all made for an entertaining but not totally satisfying
film. </P>
