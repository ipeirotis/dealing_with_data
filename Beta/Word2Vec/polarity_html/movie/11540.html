<P>     In motion pictures, there are essentially three types of satire:  a 
fatuous, silly kind that emphasizes jokes to the exclusion of all else; 
a lightly comic approach that gently pokes fun at issues while 
developing a plot and characters; and a vicious, unrelenting attack that 
uses gallows humor to obtain laughs.  The television news industry has 
been well represented on screen in each of the latter two categories.  
BROADCAST NEWS, starring William Hurt, Holly Hunter, and Albert Brooks, 
and directed by James L. Brooks, takes an affectionate-but-pointed look 
at what goes on behind-the-scenes.  NETWORK, director Sidney Lumet's 
contribution, goes much farther.  It's a dark, dark comedy that 
ruthlessly skewers the news industry on a stake, then roasts it alive.  </P>
<P>     NETWORK is brilliant, but it's not very funny in the conventional 
sense.  Those looking for a bellyful of laughs would do better renting 
something else.  This movie has its share of amusing moments, but the 
comedy is so bleak that it's best appreciated on the intellectual level.  
I can envision a viewer chuckling grimly and nodding his or her head at 
some of NETWORK's nastiest barbs; I can't see this movie causing anyone 
to collapse in a paroxysm of laughter the way THIS IS SPINAL TAP does.  
NETWORK is best enjoyed for what it is -- a blistering social commentary 
that uses exaggeration to make its point.  Terms that should not be used 
to describe it:  "light," "breezy," "inconsequential," "amiable," 
"pleasant," and "hilarious."  </P>
<P>     The story takes place in the news room of UBS-TV, a fictional, 
last-place network.  The UBS Evening News, anchored by veteran Howard 
Beale (Peter Finch) is struggling, coming in way behind ABC, NBC, and 
CBS.  In an attempt to reverse its fortunes, UBS decides to can Beale 
and bring in someone new.  The night after Beale is told of his firing, 
he announces on-air that not only has his contract been terminated, but 
that he will kill himself during his final broadcast in one week.  "I'm 
going to blow my brains out right here on this program," he states.  The  
network is flooded with calls of shrieking protest.  UBS' ratings go up.</P>
<P>     After a discussion with UBS' news director, Max Schumacher (William 
Holden), Beale agrees to rectify the situation.  So, that night, the 
anchor states that he has decided not to go ahead with the suicide, then 
proceeds to deliver a blistering attack on life in America, calling it 
"bullsh*t" and using several words that usually don't get past the 
people in Standards & Practices.  Schumacher is fired for allowing the 
broadcast to go out, but, when the overnight ratings indicate that 
Beale's tirade was a huge hit, he discovers that he still has a job.  
Meanwhile, a programming executive at the network, Diana Christensen 
(Faye Dunaway), pleads with the new head of UBS, Frank Hackett (Robert 
Duvall), for control of the news division.  She claims she can make UBS 
News the most watched newscast in the country.  When she's given the 
opportunity, she revamps the broadcast, turning it into a cross between 
a variety show and an evangelical program (which, in many ways, is a 
forerunner of today's tabloid gossip half-hours), with Howard Beale, the 
"Mad Prophet of the Airwaves" as the centerpiece.  </P>
<P>     While Beale is all-too-happy to be a part of Christensen's vision, 
Schumacher, a proponent of the "hard news" approach, is less thrilled.  
To pacify him, Christensen begins an affair with him -- one that causes 
Max to leave his wife.  Meanwhile, on the air, things are good, with 
Beale turning into a national phenomenon.  Then, inevitably, ratings 
begin to drop.  Beale's message becomes too depressing for the public.  
Drastic measures are called for.</P>
<P>     The final scene of NETWORK is intended to be frankly shocking.  
And, when the movie was released in 1976, it was.  Since then, however, 
television in general, and the news in particular, has become so openly 
grotesque and sensationalistic that NETWORK's finale seems more credible 
than appalling.  If you doubt this, consider the case of Pennsylvania 
state treasurer R. Budd Dwyer.  On January 22, 1987, he called a news 
conference to discuss his recent conviction for embezzlement.  After 
reading a short, prepared statement, he produced a gun, placed it in his 
mouth, and killed himself.  At least one local TV station broadcast the 
entire event, and the audio of the suicide could be heard on every radio 
news update in the area.  </P>
<P>     NETWORK's point is, of course, that ratings drive everything.  
Everyone in the broadcast industry recognizes this, and so does most of 
the public, so it's not exactly a revolutionary concept.  What's unique 
is the film's outrageous approach to the subject.  And NETWORK doesn't 
just stop with the numbers -- it delves into the reasons why certain 
programs do better than others and what the viewing public really wants 
(which is often very different from what they say they want).  With an 
unblinking frankness that is sometimes uncomfortable, NETWORK examines 
three undeniable characteristics of TV viewers:  a love of scandal, a 
taste for anything lurid or shocking, and a short attention span.  More 
than 20 years ago, director Sidney Lumet and writer Paddy Chayefsky 
possessed a prophetic vision -- it's almost as if they saw Jerry 
Springer and Jenny Jones coming.  </P>
<P>     NETWORK is not a perfect film.  There are times when the pacing is 
uneven (I have always been curious about what was cut from the final 
version).  A little too much time is occupied by a subplot involving the 
development of an hour long entertainment show based on the exploits of 
a group of terrorists (complete with a not-so-subtle Patty Hearst 
lampoon).  On balance, those are small complaints, and they do little to 
mar NETWORK's brilliant shine.</P>
<P>     NETWORK was brought to the screen by a film maker with a tremendous 
track record, and this was undoubtedly one of his greatest success 
stories.  It earned Sidney Lumet, the director of 12 ANGRY MEN, SERPICO, 
MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, DOG DAY AFTERNOON, and THE VERDICT, one of 
his four Best Director Oscar nominations (he hasn't won any).  While I 
won't go so far as to claim that NETWORK is Lumet's best effort, it 
ranks alongside DOG DAY AFTERNOON (also about the corruption of the 
media) as one of his most acid and pointed social commentaries.  </P>
<P>     The cast, which earned five acting nominations (and won three), is 
stellar.  The best-known member of the ensemble group is probably 
William Holden.  An Oscar-winner for STALAG 17, Holden went on to star 
in such memorable films as SUNSET BOULEVARD, BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, 
and THE WILD BUNCH.  Here, as the morally-burdened Max Schumacher, 
Holden brings depth and feeling to a crucial role, adroitly treading the 
line separating the starry-eyed idealist from the uncaring pragmatist.  
Schumacher is the character in NETWORK that the audience most identifies 
with, and Holden's near-perfect performance is one reason why.</P>
<P>     As Diana Christensen, Faye Dunaway won an Oscar for her work here.  
Her character is smart, manipulative, cold, and oh-so-sexy.  Schumacher 
offers this pointed description of his lover:  "I'm not sure she's 
capable of any real feelings.  She's television generation.  She learned 
life from Bugs Bunny."  Alongside roles in BONNIE & CLYDE and CHINATOWN, 
Dunaway's performance in NETWORK remains among her most accomplished.  
It's easy to see what Schumacher saw in Christensen, even though he knew 
who and what she was -- she's as easy to love as she is to hate.</P>
<P>     The third member of the main trio is Peter Finch, who was given a 
posthumous Oscar for the part of Howard Beale.  Finch died of a heart 
attack some two months before the Awards ceremony.  It was his second 
nomination (the other being for SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY) and only victory.  
The actor's performance is masterful, as he essays a man on the cusp of 
desperation and madness.  Finch gives Beale his power and charisma, 
making it possible to understand how a nationwide audience could be 
captivated by this latter-day evangelist.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast is no less impressive.  Robert Duvall plays the 
calculating head of UBS -- a man determined to lift the struggling 
network from the mire it has slipped into.  Ned Beatty received an Oscar 
nomination for his performance as a businessman who warns Beale about 
whom he can and can't insult during his "sermons."  And Beatrice 
Straight won a Supporting Actress statuette for portraying Schumacher's 
long-suffering wife, Louise, who is deeply hurt by her husband's 
rejection of their 25 year marriage in favor of an affair with 
Christensen.  One passionate monologue in the second half of the film 
gained her the award.</P>
<P>     In total, NETWORK garnered 10 Oscar nominations; it walked away 
with four wins (Actor -- Finch, Actress -- Dunaway, Supporting Actress -
- Straight, and Screenplay).  Yet the awards are nothing more than a 
testimony to NETWORK's strength as both a film and a satire about the 
realities of television and the relationship between news and 
entertainment.  As Beale says in his most inspired speech:  "Television 
is not the truth… Television is a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe 
of acrobats, storytellers, dancers, singers, jugglers, sideshow freaks, 
lion tamers, and football players.  We're in the boredom-killing 
business."  This is Lumet's message to the audience, and it, like 
NETWORK, is just as pertinent today as it was in 1976.  In fact, a case 
could be made that the movie works better when viewed in the '90s, 
because things that seemed far-fetched 20 years ago aren't nearly as 
unbelievable today.  One wonders if, in another few decades, a future 
generation will look at this film and guess whether it was "based on a 
true story."  </P>
