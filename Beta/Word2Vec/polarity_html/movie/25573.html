<P>     SPACE COWBOYS will be greeted with enthusiasm in a certain
demographic group simply because it dares to suggest that Americans over
the age of 60 exist. That's a fairly revolutionary notion in pop culture,
most of which is targeted at an audience that still gets graded in
"nap-time" and "scissors." It's also a rare opportunity for veteran actors
to get work in major roles, so you can't blame anyone involved for being
enthusiastic about the project, especially given its themes. It's fun to
watch a film like SPACE COWBOYS -- and probably even more fun for those
viewers in the stars' peer group -- because the film itself could be an
example of what its protagonists are trying to demonstrate: Sometimes,
wisdom and experience trump washboard abs.</P>
<P>     Clint Eastwood has been around the block a few times in Hollywood, so
you'd think that his experience would teach him the difference between a
good idea and a good script. Unfortunately, as he has done in most of his
recent films, he settles for the former. The story opens in 1958, where
the four members of the U.S. Air Force's Team Daedalus are preparing to be
the first men in space. NASA and a chimp usurp their place, however,
robbing them of their chance for space travel. But 42 years later, NASA
comes calling on Frank Corvin (Eastwood) when a Russian satellite with a
guidance system he designed is about to plummet to earth. The mission
requires in-orbit attention, and Frank takes advantage of his bargaining
position by insisting that his original team be allowed to join him for
the flight. And so Team Daedalus is re-united: master pilot "Hawk" Hawkins
(Tommy Lee Jones), engineer Jerry O'Neil (Donald Sutherland) and navigator
Tank Sullivan (James Garner).</P>
<P>     There's more than a little bit of GRUMPY OLD ASTRONAUTS to SPACE
COWBOYS, with screenwriters Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner taking
advantage of time-worn senior citizen incongruities. Hawk and Frank are
still feisty enough to get into fistfights (chortle); Jerry is still a
skirt-chaser, even with his telescope-lens glasses (hoot); a female doctor
walks in to examine our drooping, totally nude heroes (big-time guffaw). 
It's cheap humor, but it's still amusing because the performers seem
dignified even when they're doing silly things, and because everyone seems
to be having so much fun doing it. They also get a chance to turn the
tables and mock the cocky younger astronauts (Loren Dean and Courtney B. 
Vance) on their mission, a development always good for a round of 
applause. In any other outer space adventure, the hour-plus wait for the
astronauts to get off the ground would be excruciating. Eastwood makes the
Daedalus team's detailed training regimen a chance to let his gifted
NASA-meets-AARP stars flaunt their ease in front of the camera.</P>
<P>     Then the astronauts finally do get off the ground, and SPACE COWBOYS
crashes to earth. It's bad enough that once the Daedalus mission is
underway, the good humor and cameraderie of the training center sequences
vanishes, leaving nothing but crisis resolution-based plotting. Worse
still is the mission itself, a ridiculous "surprise" that would have been
evident even if Eastwood hadn't filmed certain characters with ominous
slow-zoom close-ups to signal their soon-to-be-revealed villainy. Eastwood
doesn't even seem interested in the entire third act, racing through the
events at such a frantic pace (particularly for the usually meandering
director) that you may wonder if he was running out of film. More likely,
he understands that once the entertaining interplay between the actors
gives way to shaky-cam explosions, there's not much reason to wait before
sprinting toward the credits.</P>
<P>     SPACE COWBOYS builds up enough good will through its first 80 minutes
to carry it over the massive hump of its lame conclusion. Eastwood is
still one of the most uniquely evocative visual film-makers around -- a
director generally willing to linger where other directors would cut --
which generally makes his films worth experiencing. His style also makes
him a uniquely appropriate choice for a film about characters that have
reached the point in life where they'd rather amble than run. SPACE
COWBOYS ambles right along with Eastwood, Jones, Sutherland and Garner,
right up to the point where they amble into the conclusion of a generic
summer action film. This kind of veteran acting talent deserves better. 
Wisdom and experience should tell someone like Clint Eastwood that there's
plenty of kids' stuff out there without trying to make him and his 
co-stars part of it.</P>
