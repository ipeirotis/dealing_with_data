<P>     Combine the talents of director Robert Altman and actors Kenneth 
Branagh and Robert Duvall, and you have the apparent recipe for a motion 
picture worth waiting for.  But, although THE GINGERBREAD MAN is a 
finely-tuned example of mainstream entertainment, and holds the 
audience's interest for most of its running length, it is a little 
disappointing.  Perhaps the problem is that the story was written by 
John Grisham, and, as one might expect, it doesn't stray far from the 
standard Grisham formula.  Or maybe it's that Altman has gotten lazy 
recently.  Following the less-than-stellar READY TO WEAR and KANSAS 
CITY, THE GINGERBREAD MAN (a blatantly commercial effort) isn't likely 
to appease those questing for the next Altman masterpiece. </P>
<P>     Kenneth Branagh, stepping into a rare contemporary role (and 
sporting a stable Southern American drawl), is Rick Magruder, a top-
notch Savannah-based defense attorney who hasn't lost a case in eight 
years.  Since his successful record has resulted in part from his 
ability to chew cops apart on the stand, he's not one of the police 
department's favorite citizens.  One night, following a big victory 
celebration, as Rick is making his way through a torrential downpour, he 
encounters Mallory Doss (Embeth Davidtz), a waitress whose car has just 
been stolen.  Rick offers her a lift home and a shoulder to cry on.  
Soon, her whole sad story pours out:  her deranged father, Dixon (Robert 
Duvall), has been stalking her, and she's afraid for her life.  Rick, 
instantly sympathetic because of his infatuation, agrees to help her get 
an order of commitment for Dixon.  But the wily old man proves to be 
more dangerous than the lawyer expected, and soon his two children are 
in peril.  And, on top of everything else, Hurricane Geraldo is bearing 
down on Savannah.</P>
<P>     THE GINGERBREAD MAN starts out strongly by defining the characters, 
establishing the setting (following MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND 
EVIL, this is the second recent atmosphere-soaked thriller to transpire 
in Savannah), and anchoring the somewhat convoluted storyline.  One of 
Altman's strengths, most evident in films like NASHVILLE and SHORT CUTS, 
is character development, so it's no surprise that we are introduced to 
a gallery of interesting individuals.  Past the setup, as the plot 
gathers steam, the movie takes on the characteristics of a traditional 
thriller, with such familiar elements as a mysterious car that tails 
Nick, a drunk private investigator (Robert Downey Jr.), a damsel in 
distress, and children in jeopardy.  Altman ratchets up the tension 
during this section of the film, providing a few genuine edge-of-the-
seat moments.  </P>
<P>     It's in the final half hour that THE GINGERBREAD MAN starts to lose 
its way.  The denouement and ending, while in keeping with what we 
expect from a Grisham-penned tale, are pedestrian, offering only 
contrived surprises.  Nevertheless, in part because I had invested so 
much into the characters over the film's better first two-thirds, I was 
able to accept, if not applaud, the resolution.  The plot has its share 
of logical flaws, but that's standard for all but the very best 
thrillers.</P>
<P>     THE GINGERBREAD MAN's undeniable primary strength is the level of 
acting.  Branagh, whose training in Shakespeare gives him a tendency to 
overact (see MARY SHELLY'S FRANKENSTEIN if you don't believe me), gives 
a perfectly-modulated performance under Altman's direction.  Branagh's 
Nick is strong, decisive, and obviously human.  Embeth Davidtz, who has 
essayed a number of roles since her eye-opening turn in SCHINDLER'S 
LIST, does her best work here since the Holocaust drama, easily 
surpassing her bland turn in the recent FALLEN.  Solid supporting work 
is turned in by Robert Duvall, Robert Downey Jr., and, surprisingly, 
Daryl Hannah as one of Nick's law partner.  (This may be the only time 
Hannah's acting hasn't stuck out like a sore thumb.)  The only flat 
portrayal belongs to Famke Janssen (as Nick's ex-wife), but at least 
she's better here than she was in DEEP RISING.</P>
<P>     At its best, THE GINGERBREAD MAN evokes memories of Alfred 
Hitchcock, the master of suspense who used every tool at his disposal to 
trick, cajole, and manipulate the audience into a state of heightened 
anxiety.  One of the mechanisms employed here by Altman is the weather -
- it always seems to be raining, and the approach of the hurricane 
promises even more wind and water.  Fortunately, the storm sequences are 
impressively filmed and serve to enhance the atmosphere, rather than 
drown it (like in HARD RAIN).  </P>
<P>     Although THE GINGERBREAD MAN has its faults, there are enough fine 
moments and solid performances to more than balance them out.  While 
Altman aficionados may be disappointed by the conventional nature of the 
production, fans of writer John Grisham (who gets story, but not 
screenplay, credit) will probably feel right at home.  The legal 
thriller has become Grisham's home field, and THE GINGERBREAD MAN, with 
an accomplished director at the helm, is as worthwhile as anything he 
has helped bring to the screen.  The result is an entertaining and 
sporadically engrossing two hours.</P>
