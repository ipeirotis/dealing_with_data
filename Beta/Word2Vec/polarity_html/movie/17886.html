THE MOTHER AND THE WHORE  (director: Jean Eustache; cast: Jean-Pierre
Léaud (Alexandre), Bernadette Lafont (Marie), Françoise Lebrun
(Veronika), Isabelle Weingarten (Gilberte), Jacques Renard (friend of
Alexandre), 1973-France)</P>
<P>Having lived through and somehow survived the cultural revolutions of
the late 60s and early 70s American style, not fully aware of what the
French upheaval was all about, except to notice that there was more of
an identification over there between the working-class and
intellectuals, and not the same usage of hallucinogenic drugs and
anti-Vietnam protests that was sweeping the American landscape. I was
therefore most interested that this film tackled the subject of
revolution totally by looking through the eyes of sexual change,
following the trail of a professional idler, in his late 20s, Alexandre
(Léaud), who manages not to work, own an apartment or possess many
material things, doing this by living off the women he has affairs with,
who supply him with food, an apartment to share, clothes, and perhaps
even some money.</P>
<P>We first meet Alexandre as he arrives at the Sorbonne to get
confirmation that his relationship is all over with the coed who just
dumped him for another man, Gilberte (Isabelle), who tells him it is
definetly over between them, she is marrying this other man. Alexandre
pleads his case, professing his love for her, cunningly trying to win
her back, but to no avail. We subsequently learn that Gilberte was a
virgin when he met her, and even though he treated her badly, he still
believes he loves her very much. Despondent with her decision, he comes
out of the bohemian cafe he hangs out in, Deux Magots, and eyes this
very attractive blond. His pick-up line to her is, "I don't have time to
have a drink with you but can I have your telephone number." This girl
turns out to be Veronika (Lebrun), who is the whore of the story, a
Slavic nurse, in her 20s, and someone who professes a dire need to have
casual sex with as many offers as she can entertain, especially enjoying
it with exotic outsiders, like Jews and Arabs. Going on to tell
Alexandre that her relationships don't last too long, but that men are
very attracted to her because she has a big ass, nice breasts, a sensual
mouth, and when she wears make-up her eyes appear very sexy. Alexandre
chimes in, that he also likes her when she smiles.</P>
<P>When Alexandre returns to the apartment he shares with his lover, the
mother of the story, the  30ish, well-endowed boutique owner, Marie
(Lafont), who in real-life was the ex-lover of the director of the film,
who never acted before, but has a strong sexual presence in this film,
he tells her most everything about what he does, including his new lady
friend.</P>
<P>After we see how rakish and supposedly cool Alexandre is, and hear his
amusing rantings about life, philosophy and love, (he sure loves to talk
nonstop) we also discover that he has a double-standard about sex, being
not so free and easy when it comes to having his women folk do the same
thing he does to them.</P>
<P>This "take me seriously" three and a half-hour film is surprisingly
never dull, and is always diverting and titillating in its sexual
characterization of these three rather likable and vulnerable
participants in experimental living, that has its ups and downs as far
as their compulsive libertine tendencies go. We follow the relationship
over a few weeks grow between Veronika and him, in-between bouts of too
much drinking, chain smoking and sharing a bed with the at-first
antagonistic Marie, but a soon to be more accepting Marie, until her
true feelings emerge again, as she attempts suicide but is stopped by
Alexandre, and then we are treated to hearing one of the best "I am a
whore" speeches I ever heard, as Veronike fesses up to wanting to be
loved, that sex is really nothing to her even though she enjoys coming
the maximum number of times, (she has some kind of thing about saying
maximum whenever she can) but is not ashamed that she is free enough to
go to bed with whomever she desires, claiming that she is better than
the hypocrite housewife who dreams of screwing the plumber or some
stranger, but never acts on her desire.</P>
<P>Confessions and half-baked philosophies come pouring out of this film at
the drop of a fancy scarf, as Alexandre states he can't love a woman who
doesn't love him. While Marie demands that she could have other
relationships also, just like he does. With all the so-called sexual
freedom they have, it is discernible that there seems to be a lot of
tension around them, making one wonder really if they are enjoying
themselves more than their bourgeoisie counterparts are.</P>
<P>Alexandre's male friend (Renard), also an idler, is quite a zany,
hanging out at the same cafes Alexandre frequents, showing a keen
interest in Nazism as a cultural nostalgia, and wheeling his able bodied
self around in his apartment in a wheel chair stolen from a cripple.
All the quirkiness and nonsensical palaver of childish 1970s rebellion
is seen here, along with a strong sense of connecting with others of the
similar mind-set, allowing sex to be the liberating experience that it
should be for them, if what they are into is to be taken seriously as
some kind of revoluntionary statement.</P>
<P>The film culminates with Alexandre forcing himself into making a choice
between the two women who love him, and choosing the more youthful blond
when she is at her most vulnerable. He asks Veronika to marry him as she
is vomiting into a bucket, as the scene fades out with him sitting in
her apartment, about to become a married man. This is not your typical
Hollywood romantic happy ending for a film, but one that is very fitting
for this film.</P>
<P>It is worth noting, that the director of this seminal work, Jean
Eustache, killed himself at age 42 in 1981, and that certainly some
parts of this film were based on his real-life experiences.</P>
<P>The acting is superb. Léaud the boyish charmer, is self-absorbed,
prattling on and on about himself and what he thinks he knows about
life, that is both comically funny and sad, while at all times he acts
the part of the compulsive sex freak. The only thing that is impressive
about his intellect, was that he is often seen carrying a book by Proust
under his arms as he goes to the cafe to read, which is bookmarked to
the story about "The Captive." All the women are special in their roles,
making us look at them bodily-wise as well as at their mind. I see very
little differences between the 1973 sexual mores and the 1999 ones. The
later year is when I saw this film on video for the first time.</P>
<P>How this film plays out, depends on one's perspective about sex and
relationships, and how important they are; if, perhaps, they are the
most important worldly concerns one has, even more important than money
or career or philosophy, then this film should prove to not only be
entertaining but mindful. If thought of, as otherwise, then the film
could still prove to be a most revealing study of how women look at men,
especially men who think they are real smoothies. It also should
indicate that women often choose these smoothies over other men because
they like to play games with men and feel comfortable being around such
men.</P>
<P>What the film accomplishes, is to not rely on its plot and on any
particular message, but to allow things to happen as they normally
would, relying on the compelling nature of the actors to garner our
interest, and our natural curiousity about what makes us love one
another until it reaches the surface of some common understanding. That
this was successfully done, can be attested by me from my own
experiences and how important sex was for me in forming a relationship
during the 1970s, it also seemed to shape my attitudes in love and in
the sense I had of the world. Sex always seems to be revolutionary
because it is never static, it is never quite done in the same way.</P>
<P>This film shows no signs of its age, it is impressive enough for me to
watch today as it was for me to live vicariously through it in my
thoughts of the 1970s. I think that the filmmaker could do no wrong in
this film, every gesture and endless chat seemed so terribly right. And
if the film is not an optimistic one, then that is just the way the
filmmaker saw the situation of the lovers.</P>
