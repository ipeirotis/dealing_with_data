<P>     Notwithstanding its tres-90s-hip cyber-era premise -- two email chat
pals fall in love online, little realizing they already know and dislike
each other in the real world -- YOU'VE GOT MAIL is a very old-fashioned
sort of romantic comedy.  It's not just that the film is a spin on the
1940 Ernst Lubitsch comedy THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.  Actually, it's
more about the lead actors.  You see, co-writer/director Nora Ephron seems
to understand at last what the studio bosses of old understood, what she
didn't understand in SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.  Sometimes a romance isn't 
about a concept, or a romance between characters.  Sometimes it's about a
romance between stars.  YOU'VE GOT MAIL is about a romance between Tom
Hanks and Meg Ryan.</P>
<P>     Mind you, they do play characters in the film.  Hanks is Joe Fox,
whose family company is a chain discount bookstore; Ryan is Kathleen
Kelley, whose family business is a neighborhood children's bookstore on
Manhattan's Upper West Side just down the block from a brand new Fox
Books.  By day they're quarreling competitors, each with a fizzling
relationship -- Joe with a caffeine-fueled editor (Parker Posey), Kathleen
with a provocateur journalist (Greg Kinnear).  By night they're lonely
hearts correspondents, sharing deep thoughts on big issues.  </P>
<P>     YOU'VE GOT MAIL does manage to do an effective job of poking into the
appeal and the problems of online interactions.  It's easy for Kathleen
(as "Shopgirl") and Joe (as "NY152") to connect while connected, revealing
themselves more fully and more quickly in an environment where fear of
rejection is mitigated by anonymity.  At the same time, Ephron and sister
Delia use variations on the idea that "it's not personal" to show how easy
it is disconnect real people from the way we encounter them, whether in
the flesh or after a cursor.  Trust this writer -- who met his wife
online, and knows whereof he speaks -- that the Ephrons get their subject
right, right down to the embarrassment of people involved in The Love That
Dare Not Type Its Username.</P>
<P>     Yet even this thematic material is little more than a pleasant fringe
benefit, because YOU'VE GOT MAIL is first and foremost a chance to watch
two incredibly engaging performers together.  It only takes a few moments
watching Hanks and Ryan together to realize what SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, for
all its storybook charms, was missing:  Hanks and Ryan together.  Here
they bicker and banter, bond warily, and generally offer delights for all
who watch.  YOU'VE GOT MAIL's final half hour is an improvement over THE
SHOP AROUND THE CORNER in that it sets a stronger foundation for the
rapproachment to come, but it also means plenty of time to enjoy the
chemistry between the two stars.  Hanks is playing Hanks (smart, funny and
too-nice-for-words), Ryan is playing Ryan (smart, funny and
too-cute-for-words), and it doesn't even matter that they're not trying
very hard to create distinctive characters.  Ephron just gives them clever
things to say, and gets out of the way.</P>
<P>     It's nice to see Ephron show some comic instinct again after the
ineptitude of MICHAEL and MIXED NUTS, but even here there's a fair amount
of flab in her film-making.  The peeks into Joe's dysfunctional family,
where all the men keep nabbing trophy wives, only makes the nice guy
normalcy of Hanks-as-Hanks harder to accept, while the supporting cast
(Posey, Kinnear, Dave Chappelle, Steve Zahn) is ominpresent without having
much to do.  Much of the first hour of YOU'VE GOT MAIL feels very
inefficient, but fortunately Ephron saves the best for last.  Even as the
film creeps up on the two hour mark, it's unlikely to lose viewer
interest, because that's when Hanks and Ryan shine brightest.  YOU'VE GOT
MAIL is a celebrity-powered wish-fulfillment, and that's okay.  Sometimes
it's enjoyable just watching nice things happen to nice people, even if
the nice people involved happen to be movie stars.</P>
