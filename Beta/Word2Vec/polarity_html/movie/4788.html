<PRE>                             RUMBLE IN THE BRONX
                               (HONG FAAN KUI)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     RUMBLE IN THE BRONX (HONG FAAN KUI) is WEST SIDE STORY on
steroids.  Actually the story is nothing more than a thin veneer and a
poor one at that over a movie to show off the martial arts talents of
Jackie Chan.  Now, when you have someone as athletically gifted as
Chan, viewing his skills in even a ridiculous film is not such a bad
idea.  He actually does all of his own stunts, and you are likely to
sit there and go "oh my god" through most of the show.  This guy is
physically incredible plus he is handsome and as sweet as can be.  That
he could shine through this miserable show is certainly a tribute to
his considerable skills which are not overrated.  I have been told that
he has been in much better movies which is certainly plausible, but
this is the only movie of his that I have ever seen.</P>
<P>     As soon as I got in the theater, I sensed the movie was going to
be different; certainly the clientele was different.  The audience was
mainly teenagers in the baggy clothes that are popular these days.
They thought talking to the screen in loud voices was cool.  Before the
feature started I saw trailers for movies of the type I did not know
existed.  Very low budget action films that I had never heard of as
well as what used to be called black exploitation movies.  One dad
brought his eight year old son with him which, given the level of
violence plus the late hour, I thought was totally inappropriate.</P>
<P>     Jackie Chan plays Ah Keung who has come to visit his Uncle Bill
(Bill Tung).  Bill is in the process of selling his grocery store in
the Bronx to Elaine (Anita Mui).  Keung agrees to stay and help Elaine
out which is good since some bad guys lead by Tony (Marc Akerstream)
start tearing up her store.  Keung manages to fall in love with Tony's
girlfriend Nancy (Francoise Yip).  Tony's gang steals diamonds from
another set of bad guys who in turn get chased and killed by an even
worse set of characters.  And so on and so forth, ad nauseam.</P>
<P>     The silly script by Edgar Tang and Fibe Ma is full of lines that
make little sense or are extremely trite, but hey, remember you are
here to see Chan's action, nothing more and nothing less, and action
there is aplenty.  Chan gets chased down and run over by a killer
hovercraft, gets so many bottles thrown at him that every inch of his
body is oozing blood, and frequently he just gets beat up and shot at.
Through all of this adversity, he shows one amazing move after another.
He has the grace of a ballet dancer, and he can fight thirty people
single-handedly and come out the winner.  He can jump from one building
to the next in a chase as well as leap off bridges onto speeding boats.
There is nothing this guy can't do.  Steven Seagal is a pussycat next
to him.</P>
<P>     Actually the best part of the film is Chan's demeanor.  He looks
like a friend of mine named Kerman, but Chan smiles more than any two
people.  He looks so sweet and innocent that he might melt if it rains,
and yet he has more resilience than Superman.  Quite a contrast between
his actions and his deceptive looking naivete and little boy smile.</P>
<P>     Okay, granted that this is an action flick, but why does the
dialog have to be so bad, and why couldn't the director (Stanley Tong)
find at least one other interesting actor or actress to work with Chan?
Elaine is supposed to be an entrepreneur, but her negotiating stance in
buying the store is, "Your price is too high.  Can't you come down?"
Tough negotiator huh?  Chan is full of simple wisdom like, "Don't let
the situation change you.  Change it," and "if you got the guts, drop
the gun," but mainly he shuts up, smiles, and fights.</P>
<P>     The sets are imaginative with the bad guys carrying baseball bats
but driving something like a golf cart with flashing neon lights.  They
use off road motorcycles to destroy stores by riding through them.  One
of the best scenes has an entire building pulled down by the "badest"
of the bad guys.  The cinematography (Jingle Ma) uses dramatic colors
with bold uses of bright purples, pinks, reds, and blues.  Blood is in
most scenes, and the gore content is extremely high.  In one scene, we
have a guy completely chopped up by a large wood shredder and then
delivered to his friends in large plastic bags.  The show is full of
pain, and Chan gets more than just about anybody, but he keeps on
smiling.</P>
<P>     RUMBLE IN THE BRONX runs too long at just 1:35.  There is no
nudity or sex, but there is some dope smoking and bad language.  It is
correctly rated R for the massive amount of violence.  Granted the
picture is kind of campy, but it is also very bloody.  This show will
probably be okay for most teenagers, but the idea of taking kids under
13 to it is just plain stupid.  I really liked watching Chan's
abilities, but after the first thirty minutes, his welcome wore out.  I
would have liked the show better as a half hour documentary on stunts.
As it is, I can not recommend it, but I am giving it ** for an amazing
piece of work by Chan.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
