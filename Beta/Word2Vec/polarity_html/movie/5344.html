<P>     The year is 1832.  Napoleon has fallen, leaving behind a vacuum of 
power.  The Austrian empire is attempting a takeover of Italy, and many 
Italian patriots have fled to France to continue the fight from there.  
Meanwhile, a devastating cholera epidemic sweeps across France like 
wildfire, wiping out entire towns and generating widespread a fear of 
all strangers.  Soldiers patrol the countryside, enforcing quarantines 
by lethal means.  It's a grim era, and many superstitious folk think 
that God's judgment of the world has finally come.</P>
<P>     This is the setting for Jean-Paul Rappeneau's THE HORSEMAN ON THE 
ROOF, an old fashioned, historical, epic romance in the same vein as 
recent films like THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, LEGENDS OF THE FALL, and 
QUEEN MARGOT.  These movies have certain common characteristics: a love 
affair involving two attractive protagonists; sweeping, beautifully-
photographed backgrounds; and a tragic, tumultuous plot.  Replete with 
heaving bosoms, thundering horses, energetic swordfights, and glorious 
widescreen cinematography, THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF delivers what's 
expected.  Like any good summer film, it's fun to watch while not 
offering a serious intellectual challenge. (Presumably, Miramax is 
offering THE HORSEMAN as an alternative for anyone seeking something 
with more substance than TWISTER or MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE.)</P>
<P>     The two protagonists in THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF are Angelo Pardi 
(played by a hunky Olivier Martinez), an Italian Carbonaro in exile, and 
Pauline de Theus (Juliette Binoche), a married French noblewoman.  Their 
relationship is surprisingly chaste, primarily because Pauline is 
determined to remain faithful to her husband.  Other than a few pregnant 
glances, these two don't share much in the way of intimacy.  They don't 
even kiss.  A little extra heat might have made for a more powerful 
romance -- at times, THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF takes restraint too far.</P>
<P>     Love and emotion aside, this is a wonderful spectacle, and, with 
all the action and adventure, it's an undeniably enjoyable romp.  Even 
those who typically shun France's more artistic fare will be entertained 
by this big-budget feature.  Not counting the subtitles, it's the kind 
of thing that Hollywood would be proud of.  There's nothing in this film 
that American audiences can't relate to.</P>
<P>     The story opens with Angelo dodging a trio of Austrian assassins 
sent to Aix-en-Provence to murder him.  With the killers hot on his 
trail, he flees to the city of Manosque.  Before he can join up with a 
group of Italian refugees, he is accused of poisoning a water supply, 
and has to run from an angry mob.  Angelo takes to the rooftops as riots 
break out in the streets below.  When a thunderstorm strikes, he 
shelters in a house.  The woman living there is Pauline, and, upon 
encountering Angelo, she reacts with unexpected calmness, inviting him 
to warm up and have some tea.  Soon after, the two are paired in a 
flight across France to reunite Pauline with her husband and send Angelo 
back to Italy.</P>
<P>     Although much of THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF is more lighthearted than 
many sweeping melodramas, there are moments of stark, horrifying power.  
Most deal with the effects of cholera on France's unprepared populace.  
Early in the film, there is a scene where Angelo stumbles into an 
abandoned house to find a flock of crows gorging themselves on the 
pasty, decaying corpses of the former human occupants.  It's a 
chillingly memorable moment.</P>
<P>     This is one of the most lavish, recent French exports, and the 
production values are top-notch.  Rappeneau (CYRANO DE BERGERAC) directs 
with a sure hand, Martinez and Binoche do credible (if not spectacular) 
jobs, and cameos by Francois Cluzet and the ubiquitous Gerard Depardieu 
add a few brief moments of "star power".  Despite all of this, however, 
THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF is not a transcendent experience.  But, while 
it doesn't have the power to get eyes misty and hearts aflutter, it's 
still entertaining enough to make the two hours pass quickly.</P>
