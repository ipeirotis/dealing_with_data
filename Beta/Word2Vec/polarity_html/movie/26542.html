PAY IT FORWARD
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>In Mimi Leder's PAY IT FORWARD, seventh grade social studies teacher 
Eugene Simonet throws out his standard challenge to his new students 
("Think of an idea to change our world -- and put it into action.").  
Eugene, a severe-burn victim, is played in another strong performance by 
two-time Academy Award-winner Kevin Spacey (AMERICAN BEAUTY).</P>
<P>Previous classes haven't taken Eugene's change-the-world assignment 
seriously, but this year Trevor McKinney, a latchkey kid, does.  At 11, 
Trevor is one of the smallest and youngest kids in his class.  And with 
AWOL parents, he is wise and serious beyond his years.  As Trevor, Haley 
Joel Osment, Oscar nominee for THE SIXTH SENSE, is amazing again.  This 
role, however, isn't nearly as meaty as his last; so don't expect to see 
any nominations for him this time.</P>
<P>"So you'll like flunk us if we don't change the world?" Trevor demands 
to know in a quizzical panic.  "No, you might just squeak by on a 'C,'" 
Eugene shoots back with a delicate mixture of sweet humor and biting 
sarcasm.</P>
<P>Trevor eventually comes up with an idea along the lines of a Good 
Samaritan chain letter.  His simple plan is that people should do good 
deeds for three other people.  His rules: "#1 it has to be something 
that really helps people, #2 something they can't do by themselves and 
#3 I do it for them, they do it for three other people."  The only 
caveat is that people can't pay it "back."  They can only pay it 
"forward," i.e., they must do something for someone else, not for the 
person who helped them.</P>
<P>Trevor's mother, Arlene (Helen Hunt), is one of the characters in need 
of a lot of help.  She is an admitted alcoholic with an abusive husband 
and a woman whose only friends are other drunks.  Working two jobs and 
drinking heavily when she is home, Arlene is rarely there for her son, 
either physically or emotionally.  One of their mother-son 
confrontations will have parents (and kids) in the audience flinching 
and perhaps even shedding a tear or two.  Arlene's husband, a fellow 
drunk, is currently in one of his long banishment periods.</P>
<P>Both Spacey and Hunt are made to look awful in the service of their 
craft.  Arlene, especially after a long night of boozing, doesn't look 
the least bit like Helen Hunt.  Although Arlene's make-up and clothes 
are convincingly terrible at first, she is spruced up too quickly, as 
if, in some scene left on the cutting room floor, she had a makeover by 
a beauty consultant.  In contrast, as the story advances, Eugene shows 
even more of his deep physical scars.</P>
<P>Jerry (James Caviezel, FREQUENCY), the first person who Trevor tries to 
help, is a street person with a heavy drug habit.  Eugene, Arlene and 
Jerry share several traits.  Eugene hides the story behind his burns.  
Arlene hides her bottles like squirrels do nuts.  And Jerry just hides, 
period, lest Trevor find him shooting up again.  Similarly, Eugene lives 
for the rigidity of his precious schedule.  Arlene lives for her next 
drink.  And Jerry lives for his next fix.  Trevor and his pay-it-forward 
scheme change all of this.</P>
<P>A parallel story, which starts slightly in the future, has a newspaper 
man (Jay Mohr), who is himself befriended by a pay-it-forwarder, 
tracking down the origin of the movement.  Although it is an important 
adhesive for the storyline, this subplot never provides anywhere near 
the emotional or dramatic impact that it could have.  Overall, Leslie 
Dixon's script, based on Catherine Ryan Hyde's novel, is much better 
with the dialog than the narrative.</P>
<P>One of the many sharply written interchanges between Trevor and Eugene 
occurs when Eugene incorrectly thinks that Trevor is questioning his 
sincerity.  "Do I strike you as someone being falsely nice?" Eugene asks 
caustically.  "No, you're not even really nice," Trevor replies with 
bitter honesty.</P>
<P>Although PAY IT FORWARD has more than enough to be able to recommend it, 
it does have two significant problems.  First, major plot twists are 
needlessly telegraphed, destroying what would otherwise have been 
dramatic surprises.  Second, the acting is frequently too subdued, and 
you can almost feel the director throttling back her cast.  Yes, there 
are some definitely saccharine scenes, but many others that should have 
had significant emotional impact come across surprisingly lukewarm.  
This will probably be an unpopular opinion, but PAY IT FORWARD is that 
rare movie that would be more effective if it were schmaltzier.</P>
<P>PAY IT FORWARD runs a bit too long at 2:02.  It is rated PG-13 for 
mature thematic elements including substance abuse/recovery, some sexual 
situations, language and brief violence.  It would probably be too 
strong for most kids under 13.</P>
