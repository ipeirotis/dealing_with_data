<PRE>                            DANGEROUS BEAUTY
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     As the wealthy, but illiterate, assembled wives stare in
disbelief, Veronica Franco, the highly educated courtesan, uses Latin
to discuss the common fruit she holds in her hand and then performs an
erotic act with it that challenges the laws of physics.  The stunningly
beautiful Catherine McCormack, the female lead in BRAVEHEART, plays the
poetry-spewing prostitute.</P>
<P>     Welcome to the city-state of Venice in the late 1500s.  The
opening credits of DANGEROUS BEAUTY, thankfully, say the story is true
-- it's based on Margaret Rosenthal's biography "The Honest Courtesan."
Were it not true, as it claims to be so, the frequently ridiculous,
silly plot would have had the audiences laughing at all the wrong
places.</P>
<P>     We learn, for example, that most women of that era, with the
exception of courtesans, were not able to read.  It seems the
courtesans were the only females permitted in the libraries because
they needed the knowledge to advise their clients in more matters than
just sex.  For those of you who have trouble suspending disbelief in
movies, this film may short-circuit your brain.</P>
<P>     Jeannine Dominy's screenplay adaptation takes a modern language
approach, laced with poetry, that might be termed Shakespeare-lite, so
there are ample opportunities to ridicule the picture if you are so
inclined.</P>
<P>     But don't get me wrong, as filmed in a romantic haze by Bojan
Bazelli and as sumptuously decorated by Norman Garwood, the production
dazzles the eyes at every turn.  When the boy king of France comes to
visit, the royal barge is gorgeous coming down the canal.  Even more
dazzling and bizarre is the film's opening.  Gondolas take every
courtesan in the city through the waterways as the city's adoring males
burst out in hoots, calls and poetry.  The women, lapping it up,
respond by flashing bare breasts back at them.  (This much nudity so
early in a picture is not a good sign.)</P>
<P>     Jacqueline Bisset, cast against type, plays Veronica's mother,
Paola.  The script likes to include advice, witty and bawdy.  When
Veronica asks her mother about marriage, her mother chides her that,
"Marriage is a contract, Veronica, not a constant tryst."  (The
courtesan's life is just the opposite, as Veronica will soon find out.)</P>
<P>     Veronica's old friend Marco Venier (Rufus Sewell) returns after a
long absence to find that she has developed into a great beauty.  He
uses come-on lines that include, "God made sin that we might know his
mercy."  They love each other, but his father, played in a tiny part by
Jeroen Krabbe, lectures Marco that he cannot marry beneath his
position.</P>
<P>     Veronica's resourceful mother has just the right solution, she
should take up a trade.  Since she can't marry her beloved, she can
become a courtesan and bed him anyway.  In shock, Veronica learns that
her mother had been a courtesan herself.  Some of the show's better
scenes have Jacqueline Bisset instructing her daughter in the ways of
the flesh using vegetables and a nude male model who looks like he is
posing for a great artist.  The movie has the potential to become a
camp classic.</P>
<P>     Although the costumes look authentic, especially the ridiculous
eight-inch platform shoes that the courtesans wear, the simple make-up
looks exactly like what you see on the street today.</P>
<P>     Veronica not only becomes a courtesan, she is an instant hit.  Her
dance card, as it were, becomes fully booked overnight.  Poor Marco
finds even he can't get a reservation.  Veronica quickly turns into a
literary success as well.  She has a book published of her poetry and
engages the men in duels of poetry, sometimes lewd but more often not.
In a big showdown with her old friend Maffio, played with style by
Oliver Platt, they battle with words and swords.</P>
<P>     As absurd as it is at times, the movie, directed by Marshall
Herskovitz from the TV series "My So-Called Life," can be quite cute.
And with its full plate of romance, jealousy, humor, titillation and
even a bit of pathos, it tries to please everyone.  The light-hearted
show quickly turns dark at the last with the arrival of the Holy
Inquisition.  But the ending scene, which you've seen a hundred times
before, neatly wraps it all up.</P>
<P>     Although parts of the picture are enjoyable, the characters never
rise above playacting.  Like some ribald tale from the Playboy Channel
but with most of the sex scenes edited out, the movie is never sure
what it wants to be.  It's certainly not soft porn, but neither is it
is very substantial.</P>
<P>     DANGEROUS BEAUTY runs 1:41.  It is rated R for nudity, sex and
profanity and would be acceptable for teenagers if they are both older
and mature.</P>
