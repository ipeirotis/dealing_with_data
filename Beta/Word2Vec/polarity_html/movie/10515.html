<PRE>                            SON OF FLUBBER
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     "Remember, you're in Washington. Stop worrying about money," the
Defense Secretary (Edward Andrews) admonishes the singularly-gifted but
absent-minded professor.  He'll get the funds he needs for his
invention of the century just as soon the committees in Congress get
around to it.  The wheels of progress grind amazingly slowly in our
capital.</P>
<P>     When a studio has a successful picture, as Disney did in 1961 with
THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR, you can be sure that a sequel will soon be
on the drawing boards.  And just as the remake (this year's FLUBBER)
was better than the original, the sequel (1963's SON OF FLUBBER) also
outdoes its predecessor.  The sequel shines mainly because of a much
more imaginative screenplay.  Bill Walsh wrote the script for the
original, but he was joined by Don DaGradi for the sequel.  A year
later, this creative team garnered an Academy Award nomination for
their work in the delightful writing for MARY POPPINS.</P>
<P>     Fred MacMurray, as Professor Ned Brainard, and all of the other
principals (including Nancy Olson, Keenan Wynn, and Tommy Kirk) are
back from THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR.  This time they are joined by a
host of character actors, including Charlie Ruggles, Ken Murray,
William Demarest, Paul Lynde, and Gordon Jones, that you've enjoyed in
many other movies.  The resulting ensemble cast, with better material,
clicks more often than in the original.  The most notable difference is
the sequel's heightened imagination and more frequent laughs.</P>
<P>     Flubberoleum for your floors; drop your baby, and he bounces back!
This is but one of many ideas the professor's backers have for a
company to productize flubber.  They've even devised a series of hokey
and very funny commercials to market the substance.  But they have to
abandon all hopes for instant wealth when they find out that the
altruistic professor has signed over his invention to the government.</P>
<P>     The government, which owns the rights to flubber but will not come
through with the remuneration for it, shows up on Brainard's doorstep
in the person of an IRS agent.  The agent demands payment based on the
projected revenue stream that another part of the government promised.
On the way out of the their home, the agent notices that their
seven-year-old neighbor has a paper route so he makes a notation to
check to see that the lad has been reporting his income properly.</P>
<P>     Since the government isn't paying for his first invention and
since it insists he owes them taxes on it, the professor comes up with
an entirely new creation, flubber gas, as a way out of his financial
black hole.  Although some of the jokes, such as its breaking glass all
over town, are repetitious and not particularly original, most of the
humor is quite inventive and hilarious.</P>
<P>     With the latest scientific instruments, a la early 1960s science
fiction, the professor has a slide rule, numerous cardboard boxes with
large knobs and dials, and the ubiquitous ray gun.  The ray gun can
project small rain clouds into cars and houses, in addition to the ray
gun's many unintended consequences.</P>
<P>     The professor this time is aided by Biff Hawk (Tommy Kirk), which
infuriates Biff's father, Alonzo (Keenan Wynn), who wants to con the
professor out of his inventions.  In one of the show's many little
one-line gems, Alonzo rants at his son, "Why, if you weren't
deductible, I'd disown you."</P>
<P>     The football game in this movie is much funnier than the
basketball game in the original, thanks to a player bloated up with the
team's secret weapon of flubber gas.  This causes him to look like a
cross between Tweedledum and the Pillsbury Dough Boy.  And this use of
flubber gas is ingenious too, since the best way to prevent an
interception is to send the player with the ball.</P>
<P>     "Anyone who falls flat on their face is at least moving in the
right direction -- forward," the professor lectures the court at the
showdown trial in the story's conclusion.  It is during the trial, in
the film's most imaginative part, that they finally discover the real
value of flubber gas.  The show itself is a gas and much superior to
its ancestor.</P>
<PRE>     SON OF FLUBBER runs 1:40.  It is not rated but would be a G and is
suitable for all ages.</PRE>
<P>     My son Jeffrey, age 8, said he liked the movie a lot and thought
it was better than the original.  His favorite part was the football
game, which he thought was "really funny."</P>
