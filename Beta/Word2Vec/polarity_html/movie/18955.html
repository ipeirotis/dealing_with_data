Enemy of the State</PRE>
<PRE>A simple review by M. Pierce</PRE>
<P>  Has Hollywood run out of interesting characters and plot-driven suspense
thrillers that we must spend two hours watching Will Smith and a gritty Gene
Hackman exchange obtuse dialogue and run around dodging fireballs?  In Enemy of
the State, that is exactly right.</P>
<P>  A few parts The Net, and a few parts Conspiracy Theory, Enemy is about as
exciting as watching Smith talk to CGI aliens in 1997's lame brained Men in
Black.
Will this guy ever get a real role?  He has the Bruce Willis syndrome.</P>
<P>  The plot is bascially Smith, playing a lawyer, getting into hot water with
some high government murderers, who assassinated a powerful political figure
earlier in the movie, when a tape of the killing gets into his hands.  He
inlists the help of an old conspirator (Hackman), and, at the end, er...you
know.</P>
<P>  Enemy was one of the worst films of last year.  Not only was it sloppy in
telling its story and getting its facts straight, the acting was mediocre when
it should have been energy driven, and I didn't like how Smith always magically
out-smarted the badies when all the other extra characters, seeming more
intelligent than Smith, somehow got run over by a truck.</P>
<P>  Enemy came out around the same time as the superior Star Trek: Insurrection. 
I know these two films are different in, well, everything, but the fact that
Enemy outgrossed Insurrection just baffels me.  Somehow, quality can't
overshadow quantity.</P>
