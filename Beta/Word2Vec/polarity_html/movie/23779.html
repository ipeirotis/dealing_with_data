<P>No humans were harmed, tested or tasted in the making of this film. All
recipes are fictions.
TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX DOES NOT CONDONE CANNIBALISM.</P>
<PRE>RATING: 9/10</PRE>
<P>A psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul!
Director/writer Antonia Bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not
provided by giant beasts, but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves..</P>
<P>"..They were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to
resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive.." This true story, briefly
mentioned in "The Shining" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion
picture. In 1847, the United States was a land of pioneers, of gold-starved
Americans making their way west. It was a period of Manifest Destiny, the
inevitability of the country extending its boundaries, stretching out its
arms and consuming all the land it could. Capt. John Boyd (Guy Pearce) has
become both a "hero" and a victim during this period of relentless
consumption ... in ways he could never have imagined. Boyd's journey to hell
begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific
Mexican-American War battle earns him banishment to a desolate military
outpost, a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy Sierra
Nevada mountains in California. Upon his arrival he is greeted by a small,
motley group of soldiers, including his commanding officer, Hart (Jeffrey
Jones), a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his
aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on
life; Toffler (Jeremy Davies), the fort's personal emissary to the Lord;
Knox (Stephen Spinella), the veterinarian that plays doctor, who never met a
bottle of whiskey he didn't like; Reich (Neal McDonough), the no-nonsense
soldier of the group; and the seriously "over-medicated" Cleaves (David
Arquette), a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary
ambitions. Into this cold, bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger,
Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle), a half-starved Scot who had been traveling with a
group of settlers until they became snowbound. Seeking refuge in a cave,
they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another. Colqhoun
barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself. Our heroes then decide to
journey through the mountains to find the survivors, and Colqhoun tags along
to help out. Soon it becomes clear that Colqhoun's tale has ramifications
beyond cannibalism and the will to survive. It involves an old Indian myth
called Weendigo, which states that a man who eats the flesh of another
steals that person's strength, spirit and very essence. His hunger becomes
an insatiable craving: the more he eats, the more he wants, and the stronger
he becomes. There can never be enough, and death is the only escape..</P>
<P>It's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the
whole movie through. As professionally made as the movie is, you have to
wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this.
Teen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely
like Neve Campell. Older folks might show up when they hear that the movie
is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit, but they'll be disappointed
once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces. But jokes aside,
this is a film that is well worth watching. It has wonderful and mature
characters, that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective
story that continues to electrify you till the end. The two main characters
are also the most interesting. Boyd is a simple, honest man tiered of war,
killing and fear. His sacred wish is to live a normal, quite life away from
gunpowder and blood. Colqhoun is different. He proves that a man, on the
brink of death, would do anything to stay alive, including sacrificing his
own soul. He believes so much in this Indian myth that he starts to change
physically. It is the power of the human mind and conviction that make
miracles happen. The atmosphere in "Ravenous" is macabre and bizarre, scary
and surreal. Completely isolated from the rest of the world, stands fort
Spencer. Here time stands still, and nothing changes. The inhabitants are
soldiers driven by war and pillage. They are all somehow losers of society
that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done
anything else in their entire life. Men that are nothing, and has nothing to
loose. The result is some sort of cabin fever. Cannibalism is more like a
sick game for them. Since they find no pleasure in living, they find some
excitement in killing and dying. It's like "who's going to die first?" The
unchangeable icy landscape, where birds do not sing and even wind doesn't
move the leaves on the trees, resembles Kubrick's "The Shining". It's hard
to not get mad here! One of the scary aspects of the film is a strange
connection that the viewer establishes with the characters, and starts to
understand them, although they have turned into half crazed killers. Music
is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere. A strange musical score,
composed by Michael Nyman (The Piano) and Damon Albarn, that often seems out
of place, and in complete contrast to the image, somehow reflects the
characters' twisted reactions on the world and their situation.</P>
<P>The director herself stated that it was "OK to laugh" during the picture.
And I must admit that it is often very funny, in a strange way (such as the
wonderful quote: "..It's lonely being a cannibal. You don't get that many
friends..." or when Colqhoun is quoting Ben Franklin, saying "Eat to Live.
Don't Live to Eat.").But mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes
deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their
psychological change. Every actor does a great job. Especially Robert
Carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal, and Guy Pearce as  the
moral and honest soldier, nagged by his undeserved honor. This strange
couple resemble Lestat and Lois in Neil Jordan's 'Interview With The
Vampire' . Actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to
vampire movies, since the topics are so alike.</P>
<P>"Ravenous" starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets
to the finale, where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather
boring. However these little failures don't diminish the impression. This is
a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different
situations. It is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone's
soul, a dark side which we're all trying to hide -- but it's there --
always. It is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since
"The Shining".</P>
<P>"..I said no food. I didn't say there was nothing to eat..."
