<P>      There is an absolute poetry to the casting of Tom Cruise as JERRY
MAGUIRE which I do not think could have been matched by the casting of any
other actor.  Cruise has spent much of his career playing cocky young
go-getters, and when early scenes show him working a crowd as top-level
sports agent Maguire, pressing the flesh and charming all comers with that
blinding smile, you might think he's about to go on automatic TOP GUN
pilot.  Then Jerry describes his personal dilemma in voice-over, including
a simple phrase -- "I was 35 years old" -- which is like a temporal slap
in the face to anyone who finds it hard to reconcile Cruise's image with
the fact that "the kid" isn't a kid any more.  As the film explores a
man's search for real fulfillment over financial success, you wonder
whether Cruise might have cause to take the role personally.</P>
<P>      He certainly takes it seriously, turning in the funniest and most
confident performance of his career as Jerry Maguire, who finds himself
compelled after a crisis of conscience to draft an idealistic "mission
statement" for his sports management firm.  The firm thanks Jerry by
firing him, then systematically turning all of his former clients against
him except one:  Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a good-but-not-great wide
receiver looking for a guaranteed contract extension.  Jerry's only
support comes from Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), an accountant at the
firm who is inspired by Jerry's idealism and follows him out the door.
Unfortunately, Renee is also a single mother supporting a 6-year-old son
(Jonathan Lipnicki), and her financial dependence on Jerry and his one
client is further complicated by her growing emotional attachment to
Jerry.</P>
<P>     What is most impressive about Cameron Crowe's script is not just that
it is so rich and funny, but that it keeps so many balls in the air
without once feeling crowded or directionless.  There are half a dozen
intriguing relationships in JERRY MAGUIRE, and Crowe does justice to all
of them:  Jerry's complicated relationship with Dorothy; Jerry's
contentious friendship with Rod; Dorothy's relationship with her
protective older sister (the always wonderful Bonnie Hunt); Jerry's easy
rapport with Dorothy's son Ray; even Rod's relationship with his strong,
no-nonsense wife (Regina King).  Only Jerry's relationship with his
fiancee Avery (Kelly Preston) makes a kind of sit-com sense, because Avery
is only a sit-com character, an under-developed and superficial plot
device.  Every other bit of character interaction soars because the
characters are so carefully drawn.</P>
<P>     They also are acted with uniform excellence, beginning with Renee
Zellweger as the wistful Dorothy, who treats Jerry like an icon of a
better life.  The arc of her feelings for him -- from exhilaration to
painful realism -- is rendered beautifully by Zellweger, and the emotion
she can express with her face is sometimes enough to make you want to
burst into tears.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is an electrifying delight as Rod,
whose pride interferes with his chances for stardom.  He has a moment
during an end zone dance which by all rights should be ridiculous;
instead, Gooding makes it a glorious celebration.  There is also the
under-stated perfection of Bonnie Hunt's supporting work, and Jay Mohr in
a marvelously despicable turn has Jerry's conscience-impaired protege.
However, the most memorable cast member may be young Jonathan Lipnicki,
who virtually re-defines scene-stealing.  With his spiky hair, round
glasses and a smile which rivals that of his celebrated co-star, Lipnicki
brings a goofy energy to the screen, yet there is never a moment when he
seems aware of his own adorableness.  He is simply hilarious, and the
affection between him and Cruise makes for some priceless moments.</P>
<P>     Then there is Cruise himself, playing the terribly complicated role
of a man who just wants to improve himself a _little_.  JERRY MAGUIRE is a
film which doesn't appear to end far from where it started, because Jerry
is still a sports agent and still trying to make a good deal.  He is not
trying to turn his life upside-down, though it briefly ends up that way.
He simply wants to find balance, and Cruise takes us along on that
internal journey with skill and humor.  In fact, JERRY MAGUIRE is not just
about one man's journey -- Dorothy and Rod also make subtle changes in
their attitudes which help them discover what is really of value to them.
Cameron Crowe is not interested in some grand condemnation of yuppie
avarice which has his characters throwing off their pin-stripes and pads
for hair shirts and self-flagellation.  Jerry, Dorothy and Rod just want
to take small steps, to do what they do in life a bit better, and to be
proud of they way they conduct their lives.  JERRY MAGUIRE is a simple but
thoroughly uplifting story which is as funny as it is touching, and it
finds Tom Cruise no longer cruising on that famous smile...although he may
have cause to smile at his own efforts to do what he does in life a bit
better.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 agents of change:  9.</PRE>
