<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A casual, inane throwaway film, directed by Peter Howitt, of "Sliding
Door" infamy, without aplomb and best viewed as being a film about a
geek getting a dream job that turns out to be nightmare. A film geared
for those who can't get enough of geek angst, PC's, and cappuccino into
their system, and therefore need unrealistic thrillers about geek
lifestyles to inspire them with more highs from cyberspace. While, for
others, they can relish in the film's anti-Microsoft feelings.</P>
<P>"Antitrust" plays on the Bill Gates persona ad nauseam and has Tim
Robbins as Gary Winston, the antihero, billionaire geek and the
silky-smooth head of the shady NURV, based in Portland, which is the
biggest software company in the world. Gary takes that Gates persona on
and runs with it into murderous territory, where even Gates' harshest
critics haven't gone in their description of him. The company is
criticized for putting out inferior products, stealing other people's
genius, not making Internet information free to the public, and of
stopping the geeks in the garage from getting their product to market.
The Justice Department is investigating NURV and is gathering evidence
to file an antitrust suit against them for preventing competition.</P>
<P>On an infomercial video given to NURV employees, Gary states his deep
philosophy in a nutshell: "This business is binary. You're a one or a
zero. Alive or dead." The geeks in the garage also have a motto:
knowledge-belongs-to-the-world.</P>
<P>The hero of the film is idealistic computer programer, Stanford grad
Milo Hoffman (Ryan Phillippe), partners with another genius geek, Teddy
(Yee Jee Tso). About to be funded by venture capitalists, they are ready
to form their own Internet startup company with their friends, as they
work out of their garage, using their tech breakthrough in the field of
open source codes. Gary recruits them, as he follows geek geniuses all
over the world, to try and get them to keep his empire always moving
forward. He is involved with a costly Synapse project (it's a satellite
system that will link every existing communication device into one
network) and needs to meet a deadline on its global-communications
breakthrough, needing their particular skills for him to finish on time.
Through his snakelike charm, which hides his evil intentions, he lures
Milo to work for him. Milo's partner chooses not to work for the
capitalist pigs, but Alice (Forlani), Milo's attractive live-in squeeze,
encourages him to jump at the opportunity.</P>
<P>A tour of NURV's ultra-modern geek headquarters, which is a campus with
multi-buildings and satellites on it, fills us in on the atmosphere
around such high-tech complexes. In the security tight building Milo is
assigned, it is filled with computers and geek employees worshipping at
the feet of Master Gary. But to Milo's great satisfaction, Gary singles
him out for special treatment, anxious to have him find a way to
interface his system with NURV satellites before the critical deadline.
Milo quickly forgets his ideals and loses contact with the still
idealisticTeddy, as he settles into the NURV family and immensely enjoys
his new lucrative job.</P>
<P>Milo gets help from Gary every time he seems stumped in his quest, as he
is provided with new information from an unidentified source, which Gary
gets irritated with him when he asks the name of the genius source.
However his suspicions really get aroused when Ted, who was on the verge
of a breakthrough on the same techie thing he was after, is found
battered to death, in what is labeled a hate crime, and he is given the
data Teddy was working on. Wheels start spinning in his cranium and the
film moves in the direction of a murder mystery.</P>
<P>Not trusting the FBI, after one of their agents (Richard Roundtree)
offered him $42,000 and a Buick to spy on NURV, he decides to tell his
co-worker genius, an elusively troubled, attractive girl named Lisa
(Rachael Leigh Cook), that he suspects Gary of masterminding the killing
off of his competition to get code, and enlists her help in trapping
Gary.</P>
<P>"Antitrust" goes under the moment it turns the corner and becomes a
paranoid action thriller only, mixing together a plot about the villain
using both high-tech and old-fashioned methods to secure his ignoble
aims. He uses high-tech fiber-optic video surveillance to spy on all his
workers and his competitors, and he uses low tech methods to get people
to betray others for him. He also gets goons to hit his competition over
the head with a baseball bat in order to maintain his status as numero
uno.</P>
<P>The hero uses his computer skills to hit all the right keys, as he
gathers incriminating evidence to bring down the powerful villain and
his evil empire. The film enters the world of make-believe and has the
same empty feeling to it as a Bond film. In the end, the hero screams
out his youthful motto: "human knowledge wants to be free." Our hero,
after a selfish start, proves that he is truly selfless, much like the
heroes in the past who save the world from despots, despite personal
dangers, and then ride off into the sunset as if they were the Lone
Ranger.</P>
<P>Speak about perfect casting, then you must speak about Tim Robbins. He's
really fun to watch in his understated but brilliant performance as the
sociopath billionaire, a clone of Bill Gates. He even looks like Gates.
It was fun to watch him munch on his Pringle potato chips as he acts the
part of a geek to pretend having a chumminess with Milo. Ryan Phillippe
is energetic and believable as the curly-haired nerd, who can't say no
to capitalism, even if he can't say yes to it. The film is modestly
entertaining. It is certainly diverting. It is also senseless and
unimportant. It's a Hollywood film, a nostalgia film about the heyday of
Internet startups in the 1990s and of the powerful global influence of
the Microsoft empire it emulates and the many geeks it drew into its
sticky web and through stock-options made some millionaires and some
billionaires. A film for those who are into 'virtual unreality.' There
is no message in this improbable tale that isn't garbled. The filmmaker
had a chance to say something, but prefers to play it safe and come up
with a possible blockbuster out of a film rife with mindless action
sequences. I could see an audience for this film consisting of
cyberspace junkies willing to see anything about computers. It is an
absurd film that was one mouse click away from crashing.</P>
