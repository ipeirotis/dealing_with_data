<P>     Just so our points of reference are clear, the original THAT DARN CAT
was hardly a classic.  The folks at Disney have been using that word as
though they have a trademark on it, tossing it at everything it has ever
committed to celluloid and becoming their own worst enemies as these
"classics" are remade as gaudy nonsense like 101 DALMATIANS.  1965's THAT
DARN CAT, however, was simply a cute little caper featuring Disney's two
principal live-action studio players of the 1960s, Dean Jones and Hayley
Mills, and hardly a sacred treasure.  The second life of THAT DARN CAT
is very different from the first, but it's hard to say whether it is an
improvement.  It is a strange sort of family film: clever and amusing in
some surprising ways, but disappointing at delivering the goods to keep
the kids entertained.</P>
<P>     Christina Ricci stars as Patti Randall, a somewhat sullen teenager
growing disgusted with her sleepy Massachusetts town of Edgefield.  Her
best -- in fact, only -- friend is her cat D. C., a frisky feline with a
nose for trouble.  During one of his midnight wanderings, D. C. comes upon
the hideout where a kidnapped woman (Rebecca Koon) is being held.  The
woman is able to slip her wristwatch over D. C.'s neck with a message
scratched on the back, and when Patti discovers the watch she sees a
chance for a little adventure.  She takes the watch to the F.B.I., where
the task of following up is assigned to rookie agent Zeke Kelso (Doug E.
Doug).  Kelso and his team attempt to follow D. C. to find out where the
kidnapped woman might be, but keeping up with that darn cat is easier said
than done, particularly in a town not nearly as sleepy as Patti might
think.</P>
<P>     The script for THAT DARN CAT is attributed to "S. M. Alexander and L.
A. Karaszewski," better known to credits-watchers as Scott Alexander and
Larry Karaszewski, the team behind the oddball bio-pics ED WOOD and THE
PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT.  You can certainly see those bloodlines in the
eccentric characters who populate the film, and who give Edgefield its
edge.  A lonely old woman (Estelle Parsons) makes prank phone calls from
her room; two rival service station owners (John Ratzenberger and Mark
Christopher Lawrence) engage in guerrilla warfare against each other's
shops.  There are brothers Melvin and Marvin (Thomas F. Wilson and Brian
Haley), two over-zealous security guards, and homely butcher Lu (Megan
Cavanagh), who delivers her affections to Melvin in the form of tender
cuts of meat.  Even Dean Jones himself turns up as a flat-broke former
millionaire, with Dyan Cannon as his cosmetic surgery-obsessed wife.  And
we haven't even mentioned Doug E. Doug's twitchy turn as the F.B.I. agent,
whose facial tics grow a bit aggravating but is simply hilarious when he
goes into full prowl mode in his attempt to "think like a cat."</P>
<P>     That's quite a switch from the 1965 version, where the cat had
infinitely more personality than any human in the film.  I'm also not sure
that was a wise decision.  The cat in the new THAT DARN CAT actually plays
a fairly miniscule role in the proceedings, and while that leaves plenty
of goofy goings-on which might entertain adults, kids may be somewhat
disappointed by the film.  Director Bob Spiers (British television's
"Absolutely Fabulous" and "Fawlty Towers") maintains a fairly languid pace
for much of THAT DARN CAT's running time, focusing on quirky character
vignettes rather than funny feline frolicking.  In fact, there's no
particular reason for a cat to have anything to do with this plot; it
would have been just as easy for Patti to find the watch herself and
gradually discover the dark side of Edgefield.  Spiers does pull out some
strange and original physical comedy, like Agent Kelso's unexplained 
ability to do a gravity-defying backflip over a fence or his enthusiastic
dive into a garbage bin, but most of the humor comes from silly behavior
which might leave the little ones restless or unimpressed.</P>
<P>     Spiers suddenly seems to become aware of the relative absence of
broad, fast-paced slapstick in the final twenty minutes, which consist
almost entirely of an extended car chase between Patti and Kelso and the
kidnapers.  After 70 minutes with scarcely a bit of John Hughes-ian
bodily injury humor to be found, THAT DARN CAT turns into "The Dukes of
Hazard," with cars flying through the air, glass shattering and gas
stations exploding into a fireworks display.  Yet even during that chase,
Alexander and Karaszewski are able to toss in bizarre asides like the
mourner who watches a coffin spring open and exclaims, "That's not him!"
THAT DARN CAT makes some unfortunate choices -- particularly turning the
search for the kidnapers into a mystery which results in a predictable 
"Scooby-Doo" style unmasking -- but for a remake of a Disney film from an
era which thrived on formula, this DARN CAT is surprisingly unpredictable.
If this were not the kind of film where most of the audience _wants_
predictability, that quality alone would be enough to recommend it.  It
pains me not to recommend THAT DARN CAT, a film which would be a welcome
change of pace for any parent who has had to sit through hyperactive
kiddie fare like 101 DALMATIANS or SPACE JAM.  I only wish it had more
energy, more for the children, more of that darn cat.  It could have been
one of the rare live action Disney films to deserve the term "classic."</P>
