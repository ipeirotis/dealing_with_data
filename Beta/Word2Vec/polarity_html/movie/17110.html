Bill Duke, 1999)</P>
<P>What we have, is a very cleverly done film, that is in it for the
box-office and as an entertainment only film, and it should accomplish
both aims, at least, entertainment wise, it is first-rate. It is a good
mindless, violent flick for Americans to take their mind off the more
serious things occuring at the time this movie opened, such as the
political scandal and impeachment hearings involving our Prez and his
lady intern (and, you know how serious that stuff was).</P>
<P>To get into the spirit of the film, you must suspend your belief in
logic and accept this as a hero fantasy story, with the hero being a
tainted one, basically fighting for his own pride and perverted sense of
ethics, as he figures his life is worth $70, 000, that being the figure
he is owed by his partner in crime, Val (Gregg), a sado-masochist, with
no redeeming human qualities, who along with Porter (Mel), has robbed an
Oriental crime family to get the unsavory dough, before he
double-crossed Porter, and supposedly had him killed. But do remember,
the bad hero, is not all that bad, he is Mel, the charming hero of
countless adventure films, a guy who is full of good looks and charm,
someone audiences love to like, and will plunk down their money to see
his films in huge numbers. He also does the voice-over ala noir style,
in a deep laconic voice, you know, like a Sam Spade would do it. The
voice-over reassured me that he will live through the film (that's good,
because knowing him, he will be in every scene of this flick, and
therefore I'm assured that I will be getting my money's worth of Mel.
You see, I don't really care what happens to his character in this
flick, per se, since he is as unreal as the ones you find in the
cartoons. What I care about is being entertained, by golly, golly,
golly, gee !).</P>
<P>PAYBACK rips off the way a noir film is shot and looks, (or maybe, in a
certain sense, pays it homage!!!) and does it with pizzazz. The big city
it chooses for its locale is Chicago, with its tall buildings and el
trains, adding a dark shade to its story. The only thing it fails to
pick up from those great b/w films mood pieces of edginess from the 40s
and 50s, is that their heroes were really underdogs, they were fighting
the system, not out for their own ends and vanity only. This little
difference is easy to ignore, but it is bothersome when I see how close
Mel came to sniffing out the essence of a noir film. But I'm glad to
report, ever so close, but no cigar, tough guy. You just can't imitate
that secret ingredient without being into the real thing. So take your
$70, 000 clams you will extract from "the outfit", and enjoy that money
with the reformed whore with a heart of mush, Rosie (Maria), you both
deserve it. You were both great to look at on screen, you played your
hands well, and most importantly, I enjoyed the film, it had a lightness
to it that made it very appealing.</P>
<P>Needless to say, there was not much to the plot for this stylish film,
but for those of you who want to know the story line, this is a pure
revenge film. Porter after being set-up by his junkie wife Lynn
(Deborah), and Val, who needs a $130, 000 to square things with the
"outfit" and get back into the organization, where he can really get
good money and protection from the mob...The action scenes of this heist
are super. Porter notices that the gang is not wearing their seat belts,
so on their rounds, when they are carrying the loot, he crashes head-on
to them, killing them and then robbing them of the loot. Then Val does
his double-cross, as Porter's wife shoots her hubby, taking all the
money, which happens to be $140, 000. That is why our hero insists on
only getting $70, 000 back, the sum he believes he is ethically owed for
the work he did. This gag lends a much welcomed humor to what could have
been just a pointless actioner. At least, the filmmakers are having fun
with this one, and it shows.</P>
<P>For the remainder of this slick film, Porter is either getting beat up
or doing the beatings himself. In between there are assorted killings
the traditional way, with a heater. But there is also a car full of
mobsters getting blown up and some get blown up via the phone. There is
plenty of action, so don't worry you don't have to think of anything
when you are watching this flick, everything moves at break-neck speed.
A duo of corrupt cops get into the act, one black the other white, very
political correct, I must say. These filmmakers have a great eye for
detail. And there is a sleaze ball drug dealer (Paymer), the one who
sells bad heroin to Porter's dear wife. He turns out to be the man
Porter uses to contact Val upon his return from the dead. Then there is
the Oriental gang, and their interest turns to Porter when they are
tipped off that he robbed them. So, all-in-all, you have a lot of good
action scenes going down, a lot of funny one-liners (I laughed out loud
when Porter said, if I was any dumber I would have become a cop. You
see, Porter is acting very dumb going after the mob and its big bosses,
Kristofferson, Coburn, and Devane). I, especially, liked seeing Devane,
he is a throwback to the old noir foils. There is also an homage scene
or a rip off, which ever you prefer, it doesn't matter to me, when
Porter rips the earring off a drug dealer's ear, taking a chunk of his
ear with it. You can't help remembering Roman Polansky did that in
CHINATOWN, a true modern noir film, a film that caught the essence of
that genre.</P>
<P>The filmmakers are first time director and former screen writer of L.A.
CONFIDENTIAL, Brian Helgeland. The film is based on a novel, THE HUNTER,
by Richard Stark. The film works for all the above reasons, and most of
all it works, because Mel is great for the part.</P>
