<P>     VOLCANO is one of those films (like last year's TWISTER and 
INDEPENDENCE DAY) for which it doesn't matter what I (or any other 
critic) have to say.  Disaster movie junkies will go to get their fix; 
those who can't tell the difference between THE TOWERING INFERNO and DIE 
HARD will stay away.  Still, the burning question is probably the most 
obvious one:  Which is better, VOLCANO or DANTE'S PEAK?  Issues of 
credibility aside (both movies stray deeply into the preposterous, the 
former more often than the latter), there's no question whatsoever that 
VOLCANO makes for the better night out.  In fact, this is one of the 
best pure disaster movies ever made (not that it has much competition).  
Congratulations to director Mick Jackson for a job well done.</P>
<P>     From the opening credits, when the camera takes us through a crack 
in the earth to uncover the raging torrent of molten rock below, there's 
a sense that VOLCANO might actually live up to its pre-release hype.  
Once the credits are finished, the film adheres to the rigid, 
uncompromising structure embraced by nearly all disaster movies.  The 
first few scenes introduce us to the major players.  Next comes the 
buildup to the eruption -- thirty minutes of taut, well-paced 
anticipation.  Then, exhibiting the flair and style of a master, Jackson 
uses tremendous visual effects, ear-popping digital sound, and a high-
energy tension to usher in the coup de grace. </P>
<P>     Character development fits into the "obligatory" category, but 
that's a significant improvement over what TWISTER offered.  Here, we 
have Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones), the head of Los Angeles' Office of 
Emergency Management (OEM), who smells a disaster around every corner.  
When a mild earthquake (4.9 on the Richter Scale) shakes the city, he 
abandons a vacation with his thirteen-year old daughter (Gaby Hoffman) 
to come into work, uncertain how his second-in-command, Emmett Reese 
(Don Cheadle), will handle the situation on his own.  Soon, however, 
strange things start happening.  Several men working underground are 
scalded to death.  The water temperature of a lake goes up by six 
degrees in twelve hours.  And the La Brea tar pits begin to pop and 
bubble in earnest.  Concerned that some geological cataclysm may be 
approaching, Roark requests the help of an expert.  He gets Dr. Amy 
Barnes (Anne Heche), who believes that L.A. could be sitting atop a 
volcano that's about to become active.</P>
<P>     In real life, I don't know anyone who believes that the residents 
of Los Angeles have anything to fear from volcanoes, but this film makes 
it very easy to suspend that particular disbelief.  Not only is VOLCANO 
a hell of a ride, but the script has enough intelligence (relatively 
speaking, that is) that it's possible to become engrossed in the movie 
without constantly being jerked back to reality by stupid and obvious 
plot contrivances.  Oh, there are missteps, such as an ill-conceived 
subplot about racial strife between a black youth and a white cop, but 
VOLCANO surprisingly manages to avoid many of the most common disaster 
movie pitfalls (probably because it keeps the number of major characters 
to a minimum).</P>
<P>     Tommy Lee Jones' Roark is a wonderfully heroic figure -- a man of 
action who never has time to rest.  The fate of the city rests on his 
shoulders, and he knows it.  Jones' fierce, unflagging portrayal helps 
us accept Roark not only as the man to save L.A., but as a loving father 
who is more concerned about his daughter's safety than that of every 
other citizen.  Anne Heche (DONNIE BRASCO), a young actress who has 
experienced quite a bit of recent exposure, offers a spunky 
interpretation of her sidekick-turned-love interest role.  Don Cheadle 
(ROSEWOOD) is in top form -- most of the film's comic moments revolve 
around him.  The rest of the cast isn't nearly as impressive, but, since 
no one else has much screen time, any number of acting deficiencies can 
be forgiven.</P>
<P>     All that most people want from a disaster movie is a jolt of 
adrenaline and a chance to "ooh" and "ahh", and VOLCANO fills both 
cravings.  After all, there's a lot at stake -- this isn't some sleepy 
Northwestern town, it's the second most populous city in the United 
States (L.A. has suddenly become a favorite target of motion picture 
mayhem -- see INDEPENDENCE DAY, ESCAPE FROM L.A., and next year's 
GODZILLA for other examples).  The special effects are top-notch.  When 
a lava river starts flowing down Wilshire Boulevard, we believe that 
it's actually happening.</P>
<P>     Normally, I detest any voiceover narration, but VOLCANO manages to 
do something in that department to enhance the picture.  Many scenes 
feature broadcast commentary by television stations reporting on the 
crisis.  There's more than a hint of parody as correspondents react in 
horror to events around them while staying out of harm's way.  
Screenwriters Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray should be commended for 
this aspect of their script -- it's right on target.</P>
<P>     VOLCANO has opened the "summer" movie season at an astoundingly 
early late-April date.  But there's no mistaking this as anything but a 
blockbuster trying to get a running jump on competition like THE FIFTH 
ELEMENT and THE LOST WORLD.  This isn't the kind of film where it's 
worth waiting for the video tape -- it's too big and brash, and demands 
the speakers and atmosphere of a state-of-the-art theater.  Like 
TWISTER, it pushes the cinematic experience closer to the level of an 
amusement park ride.  However, unlike TWISTER, VOLCANO doesn't demand a 
complete short-circuit of all mental functions.  Although you see this 
film for the spectacle, the other stuff (characters, plot, etc.) doesn't 
get in the way, and that's the formula for success in this genre.  
VOLCANO triumphs with a resounding bang.</P>
