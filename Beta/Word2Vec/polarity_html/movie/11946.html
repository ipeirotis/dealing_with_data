<P>     As the world hurtles towards the end of the second millennium, 
there seems to be an increased awareness of mysticism and things 
spiritual.  Suddenly, it's hip to believe in God (not necessarily a 
specific god -- an amorphous, non-denominational deity will do), an 
afterlife, and, of course, angels.  The entertainment industry, never 
one to be left out on any trend, has thrown itself headlong into this 
one.  On TV, the cloying "Touched by an Angel" is a hit -- a mainstay of 
many people's Sunday night viewing plans.  And the movies have jumped on 
the bandwagon, too, giving us enough celestial beings in the last few 
years to crowd the head of a pin -- MICHAEL, THE PREACHER'S WIFE, WIDE 
AWAKE, and now CITY OF ANGELS.  Add films that feature Satan and his 
minions (like DEVIL'S ADVOCATE and FALLEN) or less well-defined issues 
of mortality (i.e., CONTACT and THE SWEET HEREAFTER), and this list of 
titles explodes.</P>
<P>     Most American-made motion pictures based on foreign originals tend 
to be huge disappointments.  I could probably name 15 or 20 examples, 
but I'll confine myself to two obvious ones:  THE VANISHING and 
DIABOLIQUE, both of which were so bad that they were insulting.  There 
have been exceptions, of course.  THE BIRDCAGE was an enjoyable 
Americanization of LA CAGE AUX FOLLES.  SOMMERSBY did some interesting 
things with THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE.  And now CITY OF ANGELS has 
effectively re-worked (rather than re-made) Wim Wenders' 1988 art-house 
classic, WINGS OF DESIRE, by taking away some of the earlier film's more 
meditative elements and deepening the romantic aspect.  The ending is 
completely, and surprisingly, different.</P>
<P>     CITY OF ANGELS is based, not unexpectedly, in Los Angeles, which 
here is a literal "City of Angels," with the invisible celestial agents 
sitting high atop billboards and skyscrapers.  Dressed like Heaven's Men 
in Black, the angels are an odd bunch.  They spend their days and nights 
observing and occasionally offering comfort to select humans.  They 
cannot touch, taste, or smell.  They are immortal and ethereal.  They 
live in a library and spend time at the beach in a kind of wordless 
communion.</P>
<P>     Seth (Nicolas Cage) is just one of many angels assigned to Los 
Angeles.  But, unlike most of his brethren, he has a strong desire to 
experience what it's like to be human.  He seems to share the sentiment 
of a comment that he relates to fellow angel Cassiel (Andre Braugher):  
"What good would wings be if you couldn't feel the wind on your face?"  
One day, Seth is in a hospital to guide a dying man to the next life.  
His attention is captured by the determination of a doctor, Maggie Rice 
(Meg Ryan), to save the patient's life.  Later, he returns with the 
intention of soothing Maggie's distress, but it proves to be a difficult 
task.  Soon, he is spending hours on end watching her, eventually 
revealing himself as a benevolent stranger.  Seth has fallen in love 
with Maggie, but he thinks it's a doomed proposition until a angel-
turned-human (Denis Franz) reveals that God gives all of his creations 
free will, and, if Seth wants it enough, he can shed his wings for a 
human body.  But, just because Seth loves Maggie, there's no guarantee 
that she will reciprocate his feelings, and if he gives up his 
immortality for a romantic illusion, what then?</P>
<P>     When it comes to heavenly matters, CITY OF ANGELS doesn't offer any 
particular insights.  The movie does not ponder the meaning of life; 
rather, it shamelessly celebrates the human experience by demonstrating 
the monotony of endless voyeurism.  On a somewhat less-intellectual 
level, it's also about sacrifice.  But the film doesn't thrive on ideas 
alone (if it tried, it would be in trouble, since it's not that deep).  
Solid acting and positive chemistry are critical to CITY OF ANGELS' 
success.</P>
<P>     Nicolas Cage is fine as Seth, although there are times when he 
doesn't quite fit into the angel's shoes.  Cage is good as the detached 
observer, watching and waiting, but there's a quality of childlike 
innocence to Seth that he doesn't quite pull off.  There's a scene in 
CITY OF ANGELS that is pretty much lifted from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, 
and it illustrates how much more convincing James Stewart was.  Meg 
Ryan, as always, is delightful and ebullient as Maggie.  This is a case 
of perfect casting -- I can only think of a few other actresses who are 
as good as Ryan in this kind of role.  Her range -- despair and hope, 
pain and rapture -- places her work in CITY OF ANGELS alongside that in 
PRELUDE TO A KISS and COURAGE UNDER FIRE as proof that she is a capable, 
well-rounded dramatic talent.  Meanwhile, in a supporting role (the one 
essayed by Peter Falk in WINGS OF DESIRE and its sequel, FARAWAY SO 
CLOSE), scene-stealing Denis Franz is delightful as the king of 
hedonism.</P>
<P>     I suspect CITY OF ANGELS is going to remind many viewers of GHOST, 
but there's a big difference:  this film is more true and less 
manipulative.  (In tone, although not necessarily in content, it 
reminded me of TRULY MADLY DEEPLY.)  Ultimately, it is a tear-jerker, 
but there's more to it than that.  While the movie isn't as effective as 
WINGS OF DESIRE in developing the angels' culture and presenting a 
meditation upon spirituality, it gives us a pair of well-developed 
protagonists worth caring about and establishes a complex dynamic 
between them.  CITY OF ANGELS is more romantic than profound, but Dana 
Stevens' script is thoughtful and intelligent, and I never felt insulted 
by what the characters say, do, or think.  Director Brad Silberling, who 
previously made another supernatural tale, the live-action CASPER, 
effectively suggests the spiritual/material duality of the world.  It's 
a subdued motion picture, but the lack of overt melodrama makes for a 
moving and involving story.  Even for those enraptured by WINGS OF 
DESIRE, CITY OF ANGELS is strong enough to cast its own quietly romantic 
spell.</P>
