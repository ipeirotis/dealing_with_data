<P>In the continuation of Warner Brother's franchise, Joel Schumacher has
successfully killed this cash cow. What makes this film such a grand
disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved
with the film.
Avika Goldsman's screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no
suspense built from one scene to another. This coming on the heals of
such a marvelously written project as "THE CLIENT" is such a shock that
it gives rise to thoughts that the latter film was a fluke.  Situations
are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get
the characters from one point to another. This is most glaringly brought
to point by the appearance of Alicia Silverstone's BATGIRL, who just
happens to be Alfred's niece.
The story of Dr. Victor Freeze is told almost completely in dialogue as
an afterthought. While working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted
by his wife, Dr. freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure, and
becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment. Now of
course he has become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a
frozen planet where only he can live. 
Now the logic of that little sub-plot escapes me. If Mr. Freeze wanted
to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death,
why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth. This is
indeed a cold hearted man. The development of POISON IVY is no less
contradictory. She wants to breed a form of plant life that can defend
itself like an animal. She joins with Mr. Freeze in his plan to start a
new ice age, destroying all animal life, therefore giving her plant
creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to
breed into them. The characters have no logic. 
Batman of course is no longer the Dark Knight of the earlier films. Now
that he has an adoptive son in Burt Ward / Robin, Bruce Wayne is trying
to be a Father figure, constantly spouting out homilies about family and
relationships, while at the same time not really having any. George
Clooney tries in vain to keep from rolling his eyes while reciting the
dialogue given him. To say that his performance is workman-like is to be
generous. His best performances are still on "E.R.".
Bruce Wayne has the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend (played
by Elle Macpherson) , that it brings into question Bruce's latent
homosexuality. There is no spark and no passion (as there was for Nicole
Kidman's psychologist in "Batman Forever") between Bruce and anyone
other than Alfred. And even that relationship is very reserved.
Robin comes off less charismatic that in the last film in the series.
Now he's just a spoiled kid. In "Batman Forever", Burt Ward wanted to be
Batman's partner and friend. Now, Robin is suffering from Ego
deficiency. Robin's attraction for Poison Ivy is not believable, except
for a boy around the age of 15. His later flirtation with Batgirl smacks
of incest, even though they are not related in a traditional sense.
Chris O'Donnell, once considered a rising star, successfully burns up on
reentry with this performance. His Robin needs nothing more than a good
spanking. 
The less said about Alicia Silverstone's performance the better. This
talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing
actor for a Godzilla film. She was cast strictly for her commercial
value and she knew it. 
This brings us to the villains. Arnold Scharzenegger walks through his
part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday. The most
rediculous scene is during Mr. Freeze's imprisonment. The guards are at
least a foot taller that Arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the
most unbelievable fights scenes caught on film. It's almost as ludicrous
as seeing Michael Jackson as a gang member.
Umu Thurman struts and coos her way through her part, showing a growing
discomfort with her sex symbol status. Her Poison Ivy has all the come
hither sex appeal of May West in "Sextette" (1978). 
The only performances worthy of notice are Pat Hingle and Michael Gough.
These two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely
lacking from the rest of the film. 
Without going through the intricacies of the plot, there is one question
that always comes to mind with this series (except for the first
"BATMAN"), and that is how do these super villains manage to hire so
many thugs only to abandon them at the final reel. Mr. Freeze is
introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlums that seem to have
stepped out of an old KISS music video. Every villain (even the minor
ones) have to have a LOOK, no one can be an individual with day glow
paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume. 
With this film, Warner Brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series
back to it's TV incarnation. The only thing missing from the action
scenes are the superimposed titles detailing the POWs!, GWAAAA's, and
CLANG's associated with the old series. You almost wonder if William
Dozier, producer of the TV series is collecting royalties from this
film.
The special effects (by John Dykstra) and Production Design (by Barbara
Ling) are the primary stars of this film. And it is a case of
extravagance in the pursuit of nothing. Every set, from Ivy's lair, the
Batcave, to Freeze's hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to
keep the EPA in paperwork for years to come. There is no one realistic
set or set piece in the film. Everything is set for maximum exposure.
The special effects have that strange cartoon look that most rushed CGI
effects have. There are homage thrown in by Dykstra and his team to Gene
Warren and his work on "The Time Machine" (the growing plant scene) but
these scenes are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are
almost obscured.
Joel Schumacher has directed the film with no flair. Camera angles are
poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old TV series. Master shots
pepper the action scenes, destroying any flow of kinetic quality they
may have had. Mr. Schumacher is a good Director. One just has to look
back on the films "The Lost Boys", "Cousins" (an underrated film) and
"The Client" to know that. But "Batman and Robin" comes off as a mated
made for TV movie. The film has no style of individuality. It is the
cinematic equivalent to Jell-O, pretty to look at, but empty.</P>
<P>It is unfortunate that this film, even with it's surprisingly strong box
office has succeeded in doing what Warner's thought Tim Burton would do
with the franchise. Kill it.
Joel Schumacher's "BATMAN & ROBIN" is loud, colorful, action packed, and
ultimately.. boring.
* out of ***** stars.</P>
