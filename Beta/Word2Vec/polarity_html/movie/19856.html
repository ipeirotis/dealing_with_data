<P>It has happened again.  A movie that is well scripted, well acted, and
well directed.  It is involving, suspenseful... It even has an unexpected
twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus.  But
in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie.</P>
<P>THE SIXTH SENSE is that movie.  Starring Bruce Willis (ARMAGEDDON) as a
child psychologist and Haley Joel Osment (FORREST GUMP) as a troubled
youngster, THE SIXTH SENSE is more spooky than scary, though it does
contain disturbing images designed to startle.</P>
<P>Eight-year-old Cole Sear (Osment) sees dead people.  Not just in dreams.
And not just as lifeless bodies.  He sees them walking around like regular
people.  And he sees them all the time.</P>
<P>Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) is trying to help him.  He recognizes in Cole
many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom Crowe
failed, resulting in that patient shooting Crowe before turning the gun on
himself.  If Crowe could manage to find a way to help Cole, he believes he
just might be able to put his own demons to rest.</P>
<P>But first he needs to gain Cole's trust.  The boy is so frightened by
what he sees, he has closed himself off emotionally, being unwilling to
tell anyone... not Crowe, not even his own mother (Toni Collette,
CLOCKWATCHERS)... about his "secrets."  Crowe begins to spend more and
more time with him, even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around
him, his wife Anna (Olivia Williams, RUSHMORE) becoming cold and distant
because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis underplays his role, allowing the excellent script to do
most of the work of building character development.  Crowe moves from
treating a troubled boy who won't communicate, to treating a troubled boy
who is having hallucinations, to wondering if perhaps there isn't some
truth behind what the boy sees.  Mr. Willis does a serviceable job,
letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action
hero screen persona.</P>
<P>Eleven-year-old Haley Joel Osment manages to impress us with his
performance.  He demonstrates an amazing amount of self-composure as well
as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a
seasoned pro.  It is fine work for one of such a tender age.  Keep your
eye on this young man.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is also quite effective.  Toni Collette, as the
confused, frightened, and frustrated mother who can't understand what is
happening to her child; Olivia Williams, as Crowe's once loving wife who
is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her
husband; and Donnie Wahlberg (RANSOM) as Crowe's ex-patient, now grown,
who illustrates his doctor's failure to help him in the most vivid terms
imaginable.</P>
<P>Twenty-eight year old M. Night Shyamalan (WIDE AWAKE) directed his own
script, maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the
storytelling so expertly that the film's full impact is not reached until
its final moments, when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of
all that preceded it.  It is a rare movie which manages to pull that off
and Mr. Shyamalan, as the one responsible, is certainly to be commended.</P>
<P>In giving THE SIXTH SENSE a favorable "three star" review for its
craftsmanship and artistic merit, I must also point out that, spiritually
speaking, the film is highly misleading.  There is no scriptural
foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the "living dead."
The concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a
devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself.  The first lie
recorded in the Bible was devised by the serpent who assured Eve, "Thou
shall not surely die," a direct contradiction of God's admonition.  That
same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages.</P>
<P>Scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful
demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the
second coming of Christ... an event which has not yet occurred.
Therefore, the dead remain in a state of oblivion, having no
consciousness, until that long-awaited time when the final trump shall
sound.</P>
<P>And then, you'll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing
that will resound throughout the heavens.</P>
