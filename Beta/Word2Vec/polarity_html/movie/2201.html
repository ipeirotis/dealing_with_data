<PRE>                                    FEARLESS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Jeff Bridges, Rosie Perez, Isabella Rossellini, John Turturro,
           Tom Hulce.
Screenplay:  Rafael Yglesias.
Director:  Peter Weir.</PRE>
<P>     Peter Weir is a director whose best work has ventured into the
darker corners (PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK, THE LAST WAVE); Jeff Bridges is
an actor whose best work has involved loners or characters on the
fringe (THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS, THE FISHER KING).  The collaboration
of these two individuals, along with one of the fall's most compelling
trailers, gave me high hopes for FEARLESS.  It only delivered halfway.
FEARLESS contains a handful of gripping moments and one outstanding
performance by Bridges, but it also has some hollow interpersonal
moments and a lack of focus that holds it back from real greatness.</P>
<P>     Bridges is Max Klein, a San Francisco architect who walks a way
from a devastating plane crash with a single scratch, and having saved
several other passengers.  Afterwards, Max finds himself possessed of a
surreal peace, a sense that he has triumphed over death.  His reaction
baffles disaster psychologist Bill Perlman (John Turturro), as well as
Max's wife Laura (Isabella Rossellini), who finds herself unable to
relate to him.  Dr. Perlman tries introducing Max to fellow survivor
Carla Rodrigo (Rosie Perez), a devoutly religious woman thrown into a
severe depression by the death of her infant son in the crash.  While
Max begins to draw Carla out, he remains unable to connect with anyone
else, leaving his friends and family to wonder whether he'll ever
return.</P>
<P>     FEARLESS begins and ends, quite literally, with a bang.  Max's
emergence from the smoking wreckage of the crash, holding a baby and
followed by other survivors, is a haunting and marvelously crafted
scene.  Indeed, FEARLESS maintains an intense, hypnotic energy for the
first fifteen minutes, as Max's odd new persona takes hold.  Then,
rather abruptly and much to the worse, it shifts gears into fairly
run-of-the-mill family drama.  Max alienates his wife and son; wife
Laura clings with a tenacious optimism that eventually he'll snap out
of it.  This tangent of the story doesn't work for two basic reasons.
One, Laura isn't all that interesting, and Rossellini doesn't succeed
in projecting any warmth or concern.  Second, Max is such a jerk that I
felt everyone would have been better off if he had just left.  He's a
man who has turned his trauma into carte blanche to treat everyone
around him with a divine condescension, a palpable impression that
their experience of life can't be as pure as his.  Screenwriter Rafael
Yglesias, adapting his novel, doesn't have the guts to really attack
Max's arrogance, and Weir lets his Christ imagery (Max probing a wound
in his side; Max making mud from his saliva) just sit there without any
irony.</P>
<P>     The story picks up steam again once Max and Carla link up.  Their
relationship is handled delicately, and avoids the too obvious step
into romance.  Bridges and Perez convey a kind of unspoken
communication which punches home how stranded these survivors feel in a
world of people who can't possibly understand.  But again there are
swings into scenes without a note of truth, like an awkwardly acted
group therapy session.  There's also a distracting and obvious swing at
ambulance-chasing lawyers personified by Max's attorney (Tom Hulce).
By the time FEARLESS hits its wrenching climax, a flashback to the
moment of the crash wonderfully scored by Maurice Jarre, I felt as
though I had been through a ride as bumpy as the passengers on that
plane had.</P>
<P>     While Max Klein's character may not have endeared itself to me,
Bridges' performance did.  Like he did in STARMAN, Bridges carries
himself like an alien among us, but this time an alien with some
smugness.  It is he who takes an unlikable character and invests him
with some caring.  Max really believes he can save people, but he
doesn't understand that he's obsessed with his new self- identification
as a savior.  It is only when he tries to take Carla with him--rather
dramatically--that he comes to a certain understanding.  This
performance shores up my judgment of Bridges as the best American
leading actor around, and it almost holds FEARLESS together on its
own.  However, FEARLESS takes its metaphysics too seriously, and
doesn't keep its eye on what works best:  the reactions of two
survivors to a world now seen with different eyes.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 survivors:  5.</PRE>
