<P>     FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, director Chen Kaige's 1992 epic drama, told 
a tale about sex and friendship against a turbulent political backdrop.  
TEMPTRESS MOON, the film maker's 1996 followup (which premiered with 
much hoopla at that year's Cannes Film Festival) has similar intentions, 
but less successful results.  Rather than existing as a deeply-moving 
exploration of characters and relationships, TEMPTRESS MOON plunges into 
a sudsy, melodramatic formula that it never quite manages to escape 
from.  The film boasts many interesting elements, but, in comparison to 
CONCUBINE, it's a disappointing effort.</P>
<P>     TEMPTRESS MOON opens on the Pang estate in 1911 rural China, 
following a lengthy opening scroll (in English) which describes the 
current political situation.  We are introduced to the three main 
characters -- Zhongliang, Ruyi, and Duanwu -- as children, before the 
film skips forward in time to the 1920s.  In Shanghai, we encounter an 
older Zhongliang (played by Leslie Cheung), who is now in the employ of 
one of the city's many criminal bosses.  Zhongliang's specialty is 
blackmail -- he sleeps with a wealthy woman, then threatens to go to her 
husband if she doesn't pay up.  He's very good at his job, and the boss 
treats him like a son.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, on the Pang estate, the opium-addicted Ruyi (Gong Li) 
has taken command following an unfortunate "accident" in which her older 
brother smoked arsenic instead of his usual poison.  Ruyi's cousin, 
Duanwu (Kevin Lin), acts as her personal servant, kowtowing to her every 
whim.  When Zhongliang arrives from Shanghai, sent to seduce Ruyi so the 
boss can gain her wealth, he becomes embroiled in a more intense 
relationship than he anticipated.  Ruyi's passionate reaction to his 
advances discomfits the gangster and his cold-hearted composure is 
shaken.</P>
<P>     Chen's story is interesting, but not ground-breaking, and it lacks 
the multi-layered depth of his previous effort.  At its heart, TEMPTRESS 
MOON is about the war between the sexes at a time when women's equality 
was a phrase rarely uttered within China's borders.  The triangle formed 
by the three main characters is constantly being reshaped as the balance 
of power shifts from Zhongliang to Ruyi to Duanwu, with sex being the 
most tangible arena where victory is clarified.  It's fascinating to 
watch the intricate dance that these three go through as they fight to 
emerge unscathed, and to recognize that love not only complicates the 
battle, but raises the stakes.  </P>
<P>     The political climate of the 1920s serves as the film's background 
rather than an integral part of the proceedings -- the story could have 
been moved forward or backward in time without many changes.  However, 
since the period details are among TEMPTRESS MOON's strengths, such an 
adjustment would have deprived audiences of some impressive visual 
elements.  Chen's 1920s atmosphere is strongest at a train station and 
on city streets, but its influence pervades the entire picture.  
Regardless of its other flaws, this, like many Chinese motion pictures, 
is visually sumptuous.</P>
<P>     The acting of the leads is nearly flawless.  Gong Li and Leslie 
Cheung (both of whom appeared in Chen's FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE) generate 
a powerful chemistry.  Many of their scenes sizzle and one in particular 
-- a confrontation in Shanghai when Ruyi demands to know if Zhongliang 
loves her -- is charged with emotional power.  Kevin Lin is equally good 
in a role that demands more subtlety.  Duanwu's participation in the war 
of the sexes is less obvious than that of the other two, but critical to 
the outcome.</P>
<P>     TEMPTRESS MOON requires concentration, especially at the beginning, 
because, as scenes change and the story makes occasionally-jarring 
chronological jumps, it's easy to lose track of who the characters are 
and how they relate to each other.  Miramax has attempted to ease the 
burden by supplying descriptive subtitles, but it's only a minor aid.  
Anyone who becomes lost early during TEMPTRESS MOON will have a 
difficult and frustrating time playing catch-up.</P>
<P>     It's curious that the two latest Chinese films to feature gangsters 
(this and Zhang Yimou's SHANGHAI TRIAD) are among the weakest recent 
cinematic exports from those shores.  Perhaps the film makers are so 
concerned with capturing the mystique of the era that they lose sight of 
the deeper thematic and plot-related elements that have made movies like 
FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE and RAISE THE RED LANTERN modern classics.  But, 
although TEMPTRESS MOON falls short of the lofty perch upon which those 
pictures reside, there's still something compelling about the rhythm of 
this film, and the ending has its own brand of power.  TEMPTRESS MOON is 
a flawed motion picture, but still makes for worthwhile viewing.</P>
