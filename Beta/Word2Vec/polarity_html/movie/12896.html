<P>     With CAN'T HARDLY WAIT, I suppose first time directors Deborah 
Kaplan and Harry Elfont (whose previous credits include writing the 
script for A VERY BRADY SEQUEL) were trying to recapture the mood of a 
John Hughes '80s teen comedy.  Unfortunately, while perhaps aiming for 
the level of THE BREAKFAST CLUB and FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, they 
have come a lot closer to the likes of REVENGE OF THE NERDS.  CAN'T 
HARDLY WAIT is a painfully predictable account of that ultimate teenage 
bacchanalia -- the post-graduation party.  Yet, instead of bringing 
intriguing characters with real problems and interesting dialogue to the 
bash, Kaplan and Elfont take the lazy approach of pulling generic 
stereotypes off the shelf and throwing them into a formulaic plot that 
doesn't offer one genuine surprise or meaningful moment.</P>
<P>     CAN'T HARDLY WAIT is awash in pointless subplots.  Depending on how 
one counts them, there are at least six or seven.  Some are given more 
screen time than others, but none has enough to flesh out the characters 
beyond two-dimensionality or to get us interested in their lives.  The 
difference between a good movie with an ensemble cast and a bad one is 
how easily the protagonists and their individual pieces of the overall 
plot engage the viewer.  Instead of taking a few risks to win us over, 
CAN'T HARDLY WAIT traverses the tediously safe route by stringing 
together a series of would-be "cute" scenes, slapstick humor (drunks are 
always supposed to be funny, right?), and trite "bonding" moments.</P>
<P>     Everything in CAN'T HARDLY WAIT transpires during the course of one 
all-night party.  School's out, the summer is just beginning, and the 
graduating seniors of Huntington Hills High School are ready to do the 
two things that rootless teens do best:  get drunk and get laid.  The 
main story, inasmuch as there can be considered a main story in a film 
this overcrowded, focuses on Preston Meyers (Ethan Embry), an 
articulate, lovestruck young man who has spent the past four years 
pining for the unattainable Amanda Beckett (Jennifer Love Hewitt).  Now, 
in a shocking development, Amanda has been dumped by long-time boyfriend 
Mike Dexter (Peter Facinelli), leaving the door wide open for Preston, 
if he can get up the courage to speak to her.  Meanwhile, the class 
valedictorian, William Lichter (Charlie Korsmo), is hatching a plot to 
avenge himself upon Mike for years of cruel practical jokes.  Preston's 
friend, Denise (Lauren Ambrose), is trying to find some way to fit into 
a party that is obviously not her scene.  An off-the wall weirdo named 
Kenny (Seth Green), who uses ebonics despite being white, is trying to 
lose his virginity.  And a former graduate (Jerry O'Connell) has 
returned to bemoan his lack of success with college women.</P>
<P>     What CAN'T HARDLY WAIT offers are flat characters stuck in 
underdeveloped situations.  The only semi-interesting individual, 
Denise, is trapped in a bathroom with Kenny for most of the night.  Of 
the film's dozen-or-so primary players, she's the only one who seems 
more like a real person than a caricature.  As ably portrayed by Lauren 
Ambrose (who previously appeared as one of Kevin Kline's students in IN 
& OUT), Denise is capable of engaging our sympathies.  Everyone else 
seems to exist for only one purpose -- to be at this party.  It's 
virtually impossible to imagine anyone having any kind of life outside 
of these circumstances -- such shallow characters are obviously tailored 
to the needs of the script.  </P>
<P>     For those who enjoy saccharine romances, the interaction between 
Preston and Amanda offers some limited possibilities.  You'd have to be 
hopelessly naïve not to realize how it's all going to turn out, but the 
two actors, Ethan Embry (THAT THING YOU DO!) and Jennifer Love Hewitt (I 
KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER), are so likable that it's hard not to 
have at least a minor rooting interest in their pairing.  Seeing the 
inevitable resolution is one of the few reasons to stay for the duration 
of CAN'T HARDLY WAIT's one-hundred minute running length.</P>
<P>     Just like the teen movies of the '80s, CAN'T HARDLY WAIT is 
targeting the 13-to-18 year-old group by offering popular actors like 
Embry and Love Hewitt, wall-to-wall pop music (often, the film seems 
like nothing more than an excuse to sell a soundtrack), and ample 
portions of booze and sex (although the PG-13 rating limits the latter).  
It's all marketing -- collect enough appealing snippets for a 30-second 
TV commercial, and maybe the kids will come.  With effectively-developed 
characters, decent dialogue, and something resembling a compelling plot, 
this approach can lead to a satisfying movie-going experience.  Sadly, 
those characteristics are taking a vacation in CAN'T HARDLY WAIT.  
Whatever shallow charm the film offers wears off fast as we realize that 
it's not funny, endearing, dramatically sound, or going anywhere that we 
haven't been before.  As a result, the title seems unexpectedly 
appropriate, as it accurately summed up my feelings about sitting in the 
theater and anticipating the arrival of the end credits -- I couldn't 
hardly wait.  </P>
