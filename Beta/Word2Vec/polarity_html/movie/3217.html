<P>     With his third feature, writer/director John Singleton (BOYZ 'N
THE HOOD, POETIC JUSTICE) has turned his focus from the inner city to
the college campus.  Set on the grounds of a fictional California
school, Columbus University, HIGHER LEARNING strives to examine the
political, sexual, and racial undercurrents that coalesce in such a
volatile atmosphere.</P>
<P>     For most people, the years spent at college are those of
exploration and discovery.  Confusion and heartbreak are as vital to
the maturation process as understanding and joy.  Universities across
the world represent buffers between life at home and "the real world";
places where boys and girls become men and women.</P>
<P>     In this film, John Singleton has chosen to look beneath the
peaceful veneer of college life, but the narrative that emerges is
decidedly unbalanced.  Focusing almost exclusively on the violent,
negative aspects, it ignores many of the positives.  Viewing HIGHER
LEARNING, we get little sense of community.  Columbus seems to be a
place where people go to have bad things happen to them.</P>
<P>     Three freshmen guide our steps through HIGHER LEARNING.  True,
they are stereotypes, but Singleton, as an accomplished filmmaker, is
able to imbue his characters with a vitality that allows them to escape
the boundaries which might normally constrain them.  Each grows and
evolves, albeit predictably.</P>
<P>     Malik Williams (Omar Epps) fits the traditional athlete type:
cocky and arrogant.  An urban black male on a partial track
scholarship, Malik is at school to run, not learn.  His attitude is
that the world owes him, not the other way around.  The reality that he
can lose comes as an ego- bruising lesson.</P>
<P>     Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) is a typical California girl.
Blond and carefree, she's at college for the whole experience--until
that experience includes going home with a guy who won't take "no" for
an answer.  She doesn't report the rape, but it affects every aspect of
her life thereafter and leads, in part, to her questioning her own
sexuality.</P>
<P>     Remy (Michael Rapaport) is a quiet, geeky engineer who enrolled at
Columbus to take courses and learn a profession.  But his social life
is barren and no one seems to understand him, except a group of shaven-
headed young men who claim he's one of them.  It doesn't take much
convincing before the lonely Remy joins the skinheads and embraces
their racist creed.</P>
<P>     Perhaps HIGHER LEARNING tries to cram too much into two hours.  On
top of that, in striving for a gut-wrenching finale, Singleton pushes
the issue of racial tension to a violent climax.  On most college
campuses today, there is racism, but it smolders and simmers, rarely
reaching this sort of explosive level.  This ending feels forced and
overplotted.  The tragic, ironic twist that punctuates the film is
anything but surprising.  In fact, most of what happens in the final
fifteen minutes is easily predicted.</P>
<P>     The film also loses an element of potency in its depiction of the
main antagonists.  The skinheads are presented as one-dimensional
caricatures.  As a result, the audience's enmity is equally as
shallow.  In SCHINDLER'S LIST, Steven Spielberg recognized that one key
to a powerful drama is a fleshed-out villain.  Thus, Amon Goeth was
intelligent, charismatic, and monstrously evil.  Similarly, the
skinheads of ROMPER STOMPER were frightening because of their realism.
In HIGHER LEARNING, however, there is little more dimension to these
neo-Nazis than there was to Michael Douglas' victim in FALLING DOWN.
They serve a function in the plot, but little more.</P>
<P>     Solid acting abounds, and helps immeasurably when the script
weakens.  None of the three main performers displays an overabundance
of talent, but all are more than equal to their roles.  Supporting
players the likes of Laurence Fishburne (as a professor with a lot to
say but very little to do) and Jennifer Connelly (as a lesbian who
befriends Kristen) round out a fine, if somewhat unorthodox, cast.</P>
<P>     Singleton's views of modern college life are considerably better-
rounded than those presented by many recent pictures (PCU and THREESOME
leap to mind).  Despite excesses and missteps, there is still a wealth
of digestible, thought-provoking material in HIGHER LEARNING.  The best
parts tend to be the most subtle ones--racism shown by a glance or
friendship by a kind word.  When this movie is quiet and introspective,
it speaks with a clear voice.  That insight gets muddled, however, the
more forceful Singleton becomes.</P>
