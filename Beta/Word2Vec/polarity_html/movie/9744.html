<PRE>STARSHIP TROOPERS (rated R)</PRE>
<P>Directed by Paul Verhoeven
Written by Ed Neumeier (based on the novel by Robert Heinlein)
Starring Casper Van Dien, Dina Meyer, Denise Richards, Neil Patrick
Harris,
         Michael Ironside</P>
<P>Seen at: AMC Old Pasadena 8, Pasadena, CA (in SDDS)</P>
<PRE>Grade: 2.5/10</PRE>
<P>Paul Verhoeven's last movie, SHOWGIRLS, had a bad script, bad acting,
and
a "plot" (I use the word in its loosest possible sense) that served only
to allow lots of sex and nudity. It stank. STARSHIP TROOPERS has a bad
script, bad acting, and a "plot" that serves only to allow lots of
violence and gore. It stinks.</P>
<P>Nobody will watch this movie for the plot, but here's a brief synopsis
anyway. Some friends straight out of high school sign up for the Federal
Reserve (armed forces) at a time when evil bugs from the planet Klendathu
are sending meteors towards Earth from the other side of the Galaxy.  After
one slips through the defences and destroys Buenos Aires (the home city of
the main characters), war is declared. This involves sending the grunts,
who include Johnny Rico (Van Dien) and Dizzy (Meyer), down to the surface
of the bugs' planet. Much carnage ensues. The troops are withdrawn and
sent to another planet to answer a distress call. More carnage ensues.
After being rescued, their plans are changed to capture a "brain bug"
which is believed to be controlling the aliens' battle plans (look, I
didn't write this, OK?). Yet more carnage ensues. Get the picture?
Interspersed throughout all this are brief "ads" from the Federal Network,
which present the picture of a neo-fascist state, much like in
Verhoeven's ROBOCOP.</P>
<P>There are many problems with STARSHIP TROOPERS. The plot, where one exists
to drive the movie onwards, is silly. Harris (star of TV's Doogie Howser,
MD) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in
the movie, apparently so we will accept his ability to mind-meld with a
"brain bug" later on. In addition, the first thirty minutes of the movie
(until the characters sign up for service) drag on like a bad episode of
Beverly Hills, 90210. The characters are one-dimensional, so much so, that
when Dizzy is killed, she says it's OK because she got to sleep with Rico.
I had hoped that Verhoeven's use of a no-name cast would allow him to kill
off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience, but such an
idea appears to have escaped him. The dialogue is embarassing and isn't
helped by the frequently terrible delivery (I almost burst out laughing
when Harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred
people for the good of the species). Finally, the fake "ads" become a
nuisance. Although they evoke the propaganda of the WWII-era Movietone
reels (as presumably they are meant to), their complete lack of subtlety
blunts their effect.</P>
<P>Some people will say all of that's irrelevant -- the movie hinges on the
battle scenes. So what about those battle scenes? Well, I admit the
effects are good -- the bugs move about quite convincingly, especially
when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs. And people have
their brains blown out, their limbs cut off, and their bodies ripped in
two in quite impressive ways. But this is my problem. The entertainment
value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore,
and its continous attempt to gross us out (starting early on when
Richards' character vomits on-screen). Verhoeven appears to be trying to
make a movie employing the elements that made a ROBOCOP a success, but
fails spectacularly. While ROBOCOP had a message about the importance of
being human, and gave the bad guys some motivation, STARSHIP TROOPERS
lacks even these simple features. When the brain bug sucks out a
character's brain near the end of the film, it's merely an analogy for
what the film has done to us.</P>
<P>This film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children
under 16.</P>
