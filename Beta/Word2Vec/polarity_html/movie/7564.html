<P>     Literature is a critical part of our culture.  Few would argue with 
that statement, but, in a world of rapidly declining attention spans, 
one has the sense that any book not offering instant gratification will 
not attain proper recognition.  SWANN, directed by first time feature 
film maker (but long time documentarian) Anna Benson Gyles from the 
novel by Carol Shields, is a cinematic celebration of books, poems, and 
other aspects of literature.  It is about the need to protect and 
nurture great works of writing, especially when the author is no longer 
around.</P>
<P>     Mary Swann was a little-known but much-beloved poet whose small 
volume of poetry has touched the lives of her faithful cadre of readers.  
Before Mary was brutally axed to death by her husband, she committed her 
entire collection of written work to a friend, Rose Hindmarch (Brenda 
Fricker).  It was Rose who ensured that the poems received exposure 
beyond the rural Canadian town where Mary lived and died.</P>
<P>     Now, best-selling author Sarah Maloney (played by the always-
appealing Miranda Richardson), whose latest novel is a huge success, has 
decided to write a book about Mary.  Her research takes her to Mary's 
town and she makes contact with Rose, who is operating a small museum 
dedicated to the dead poet.  Soon, however, Sarah discovers that there 
is a secret about Mary that no one is willing (or able) to talk about.  
Her investigative instincts aroused, Sarah begins to dig, and her hunt 
unearths some surprising evidence.</P>
<P>     Yes, there is a mystery in SWANN, but it's of secondary importance 
to the meticulously-developed characters and breathtaking 
cinematography.  The film creates two unforgettable individuals.  
There's brave, reliable Rose, whose salt-of-the-earth qualities make her 
the kind of woman whom people don't think twice about imposing upon.  As 
portrayed by Brenda Fricker (who won an Academy Award for MY LEFT FOOT), 
Rose is the most memorable thing in SWANN.  Then there's Sarah, a woman 
who appears to have everything but is really lacking some of the most 
basic things in life:  love and journalistic integrity.  SWANN details 
her quest to find both.</P>
<P>     The plot of SWANN moves slowly, occasionally grinding to a complete 
halt.  But that's okay, because this movie is about taking one's time.  
Poetry is never meant to be hurried through, but to be savored and 
explored, lovingly and carefully.  Aspects of this film are reminiscent 
of visual poetry -- simple shots of stunning beauty that prove you don't 
need mountain ranges or other spectacular vistas to capture the viewer's 
eye.  Everyday images presented in a specific manner can be just as 
effective, such as a sugar cube absorbing coffee (borrowed from 
Kieslowski's BLUE, but no less impressive here).</P>
<P>     SWANN is certainly not for everyone.  Its slow pace may drive some 
to distraction, and its apparent lack of focus (the soluton to the 
"mystery" isn't surprising or shocking) will turn others off.  But 
anyone who approaches this movie with the proper expectations will find 
himself or herself engaged.  SWANN is a humble motion picture that, 
thanks in large part to Fricker and Richardson, is capable of reaching 
out to a part of us that few movies touch.</P>
