<P>     MAFIA!, like its predecessors AIRPLANE!, THE NAKED GUN and HOT
SHOTS!, is a scorecard comedy.  Their goal has always been to throw as
many puns, sight gags, movie parodies and bodily function gags onto the
screen as 90 minutes could hold, operating on the premise that you gotta
keep swinging if you wanna get hits.  At the end of the film, a viewer's
reaction is likely to be a subconscious evaluation of the jokes' batting
average.  If hits exceed whiffs, everybody wins; if whiffs exceed hits,
not so much.</P>
<P>     At the risk of strangling the life out of this particular metaphor,
Jim Abrahams' MAFIA! has two strikes against it before it even shows up at
the ballpark, the first and most obvious being its satiric target.  MAFIA!
is a parody of gangster films, particularly the GODFATHER films, with Jay
Mohr starring in the Michael Corleone-esque role of Anthony Cortino, a war
hero who returns home to join up with the crime family headed by his
father Vincenzo (Lloyd Bridges).  Most of the situations and characters
are pure GODFATHER -- Anthony's hot-headed older brother Joey (Billy
Burke), his WASP girlfriend Diane (Christina Applegate), flashbacks to the
Cortinos' arrival and rise to power in America -- which seems like a ripe
enough source for parody until you realize that the films in question came
out when the average 1998 movie-goer was just a pair of gametes and a
dream.  Entrenched though the films and their situations may be in the
cinematic canon, MAFIA! just feels stale, as topical as a Joey Buttafuoco
joke or a reference to Bella Abzug's hats.</P>
<P>     At least the GODFATHER films will be well-known to most average
viewers, though.  The other major reference points are Martin Scorsese's
mob-themed films GOODFELLAS and CASINO.  The number of gags baed on the
latter film, including the opening credits sequence and the character of
Pepper (Pamela Gidley, a dead ringer for Sharon Stone), is utterly
baffling given CASINO's less-than-spectacular box office performance.
References to more recent, more familiar films like FORREST GUMP and THE
ENGLISH PATIENT draw big chuckles, while the CASINO references draw mostly
blank stares. Touchstone was obviously concerned about being too obscure
when they changed the title from JANE AUSTEN'S MAFIA! (though curiously
that title still appears on-screen), but no one gave nearly as much
thought to the actual content of the film.</P>
<P>     The second strike is the "trailer factor," which is always a danger
with a broad comedy like MAFIA!  Since virtually none of the jokes are
contextual, and 90% of them can be conveyed in a matter of moments, the
people who put together theatrical trailers and television spots are free
to plunder the film for all the best laughs.  It's easy to pull 120 
seconds worth of "A" material from MAFIA!, sight gags like a shattering
poodle and an overweight ersatz River-dancer, but you're sadly mistaken if
you think that's a representative sample.  If you've seen that theatrical
trailer for MAFIA!, with its two-minute barrage of great bits, you've
probably laughed about as hard as you're going to laugh at the whole 85
minues of the film.</P>
<P>     Comedies like MAFIA! are usually entertaining just for forcing you to
pay attention.  Dozens of decent laughs hover around the perimeter of the
frame, while several of the best moments come during the closing credits,
including a great riff on the standard "no animals were harmed during the
making of this film" disclaimer.  It's the jokes Abrahams places front and
center which drop with a thud just a bit too often.  As just one example
of the lackluster writing, the "Guess What Number I'm Thinking Of" table
in one casino scene is a joke swiped from VEGAS VACATION...and VEGAS
VACATION did it better.  Abrahams offers plenty of moments worth a snicker
or a grin, but ultimately that laugh scorecard just doesn't come out in
his favor.  He came to the plate with a 25-year-old bat, and showed all
his best swings in batting practice.  For those of you scoring at home,
that doesn't add up to winning offense.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 mediocrefellas:  5.</PRE>
