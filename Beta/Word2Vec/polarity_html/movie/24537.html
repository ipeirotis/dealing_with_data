<PRE>THE BASKET
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Opera, basketball and prejudice: an unlikely combination for any film,
especially for one set in small town America towards the end of World
War I.</P>
<P>Rich Cowan's THE BASKET is a simple and poetic film whose magic comes
from many sources, particularly two beautifully understated performances
by Peter Coyote and Karen Allen.  The director makes the bold assumption
that the audience has both intelligence and patience.  In a film filled
with messages -- "To defend a mighty wall, each one must fight for
something small," the opera says -- most are delivered with quiet
delicacy, leaving the viewers to ascertain the fullness of their
meanings and their portent for the story at hand.</P>
<P>Two teenage, German war orphans, Helmut and his sister Brigitta, played
with touching resoluteness by Robert Karl Burke and Amber Willenborg,
are taken from their internment camp to live in Waterville, Washington
with Reverend Simms, M.D. (Tony Lincoln).  Waterville is so small that
Rev. Simms is in charge of both birthing and baptizing.  Although their
parents were killed by Americans, the orphans carry little resentment;
they're just thankful to be alive.  But it's not easy since the members
of the town carry varying amounts of prejudice against them.  "I thought
the war for us had finally ended, but it hadn't," Helmut explains in
voice-over.  "Only the battlefield had changed,"</P>
<P>The one most against the orphans is Mr. Emery (Jock MacDonald), whose
oldest son, Ben (Elwon Bakly), has just returned home from the war.
Having lost his good health and his left leg, Ben has been transformed
from his father's chief helper into "just another mouth to feed."
Unlike her headstrong husband, Mrs. Emery (Karen Allen) wants to pick up
the pieces of their lives and get on with it.</P>
<P>Another outsider in Waterville is Mr. Conlon (Peter Coyote), the new
teacher for the town's one-room school.  With a Bostonian accent as
thick as Helmut's German one, Mr. Conlon sticks out like a peach basket
nailed up to a wall.  He once played under the man who invented
basketball and that's how it was played back then.  Things having not
advanced much, that's exactly how the teacher introduces the game to his
pupils, who had barely heard of the sport.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, back in the schoolroom (he sleeps in its small anteroom), Mr.
Conlon teaches the class a continuing lesson with the aid of a German
opera ("The Basket").  This creates a buzz of excitement in the village
because he dribbles out the story like episodes of a soap opera.  The
whole town becomes enthralled with the latest happenings in the story,
as if they were the latest installments of "Dallas."  His choice of a
"German" opera, even with its popularity, causes great consternation to
some residents.</P>
<P>The goings-on at the school have ramifications throughout the town.  In
a delicately nuanced performance, Karen Allen's Mrs. Emery finds the
teacher fascinating because he represents life away from the farm.
"Boston -- I always wanted to visit Boston," she sighs when Mr. Conlon
tells her of his home.  "Or any place for that matter."</P>
<P>Helmut, a source of derision among his fellow students for being German,
is also the shortest of those near his age.  This means that he isn't
allowed in the basketball games that the older and much taller boys try
without much skill or luck.  Nevertheless, using laundry and a laundry
basket, or whatever he can find, Helmut practices in the hope that the
day will come when he can join in the game.</P>
<P>The seemingly disparate stories of opera and basketball come together
when the town needs the down payment for a harvester.  If they can
defeat the undefeatable Spokane Spartans, they can win enough to get the
down payment.</P>
<P>Filmed frequently with the warm glow of the setting sun, the rolling
pastures of Washington state look invitingly bucolic.  This little
filmed area of the United States clearly deserves to have more movies
set there.</P>
<P>Although the journey is the reward in this movie, its big game ending
manages more surprises than you'd ever expect, one being the half-time
refreshments of the other team: beer and big cigars.  And the rules back
then were quite a bit different than they are now.  Even the game's
slower pacing, which matches that of the movie, possesses an undeniable
charm.</P>
<P>A heartfelt motion picture, THE BASKET is a delightful film worth
savoring for those willing to take the time to enjoy its methodical
rhythms.  It's a film that gives family entertainment a good name and
one that will have you still enjoying it in your memory after you leave
the theater.</P>
<P>THE BASKET runs 1:45.  It is rated PG for some mild violence and brief
language and would be fine for all ages.  Children with short attention
spans, however, are unlikely to find it worthwhile.</P>
