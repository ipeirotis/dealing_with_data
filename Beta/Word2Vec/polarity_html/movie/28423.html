<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a Swiss cheese psycho genre film. There are just too many holes
in the plotline of this hollow thriller for it to be convincing. The
film is most successful in hiding its plot twists and its surprise
ending but, in going for that and that alone, the film lost track of how
unbelievable the story was becoming and how shallow all the characters
were, except for the Morgan Freeman character.</P>
<P>Morgan Freeman played the same role in the 1997's Kiss the Girls, and
that mediocre film brought in lots of dough ($60 million). So the
producers must have thought, why not try and cash in on another mediocre
thriller! The low-key actor who breathes an air of restraint and
nobility into his roles as he carefully measures certain words he says,
returns as Dr. Alex Cross. Unfortunately, Freeman can't carry this film
on his back, though he almost does. He's so good an actor that he's
usually better than the script he's given, as is the case here.</P>
<P>Cross is a damaged D.C. cop, a forensic psychologist, author of a
definitive book on criminal profiling, who several months ago failed his
partner in a busted sting operation and watched her die, to his dismay.
He's now in semi-retirement or on sick leave, or just moping at home,
busy with his hobby of building model boats, as his wife Vickie (Anna
Maria Horsford) says: "I have never seen a man work so hard at being
busy." Which is the clue for the clever psycho, Gary Soneji (Michael
Wincott), to call him. He has been posing as a teacher for two years in
an elite private school in Washington, D.C., that has Secret Service
agents as security for the prominent students that attend, which include
the son of the Russian president. Soneji just kidnapped Senator Rose's
12-year-old daughter Megan (Mika Boorem) and strangled to death a
teacher from the school, before making his escape to his high-tech
houseboat. He has made the FBI wanted list, but wants further newspaper
headlines and recognition from Cross at how marvelous he is. His
intention is to make this kidnapping as big as the Lindbergh case.</P>
<P>Uptight FBI Agent McArthur (Baker) is in charge of the investigation and
reluctantly teams the failed Secret Service agent in charge of the
security operation, Jezzie Flannigan (Potter), with Cross, who claims
she could be valuable because she knows the psycho from her two years on
the job.</P>
<P>The fun in this film might be in making a list of all the holes in the
story, and whoever comes up with the first hundred wins a prize. The
list might start with why a school so worried about security would fail
to fingerprint the teacher. Secondly, why one of the many agents there
wouldn't recognize that the phony teacher is wearing a latex mask when
it is so obvious; and, thirdly, why the school or the Secret Service
don't even check for his teaching credentials, which any school in the
country has an obligation to do. Once you get the error list rolling,
you'll see how ludicrous this film is. I quickly counted thirty such
flubs before I got weary and decided to give up my count.</P>
