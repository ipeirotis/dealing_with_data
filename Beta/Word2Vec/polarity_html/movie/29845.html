<PRE>THE BIG ONE (1997)
Reviewed by Jerry Saravia

<P>THE BIG ONE (1997) - A pleasurable comedy, masquerading as a documentary,
focusing on Michael Moore's attempts to focus on the truth surrounding the
layoffs in Michigan and around the United States. We see unemployed people
barking at Michael Moore and at the cameras about their poverty, Borders
Bookstore employees complaining about tax cuts on their paychecks, a woman
crying to Moore at one of his booksignings about her inability to find work, and
the penultimate moment when Moore confronts the Nike chairman and asks him why
people in Mexico are working for 80 cents an hour. </P>
<P>"The Big One" has lots of scattered moments of truth, and plenty of it is just
hearsay - the scene where the workers yell to Moore is obviously staged. I
enjoyed the scenes where Moore and his video crew enter places of business and
are threatened to leave, or when he gives some associates and bigwigs a big, fat
check for 80 cents to the Mexican workers because "we want to help them out."
All of this will be very familiar to anyone who's seen "Roger and Me" or his TV
series "TV Nation." </P>
<P>Moore has a lot of good arguments about what's happening to hard workers around
the country who work for candy companies or GM - if these corporations are
making so much money, why are there so many layoffs? One word: competition, so
they can be ahead of the others. That is why they pay so little to Mexican
vagrants or children in Mexico and other countries - it is cheap labor for
maximum profit. And then there are the airline workers who ! </P>
<P>"The Big One" is very funny throughout and is more tightly edited than "Roger
and Me." Moore could have a career as a comake flight reservations - nothing
unusual about that except some of them are prisoners in jailmedian, but he is
after bigger game - to expose the truth through nuggets of humor. Some may say
he is just exploiting the workers he's documenting. I would say he's exploiting
the exploiters. </P>
