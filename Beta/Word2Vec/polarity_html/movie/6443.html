<P>     Seeing the newly-restored, 70 mm print of VERTIGO in a theater is 
an experience that no fan of Hitchcock, or of cinema in general, should 
miss.  Especially for those (like me) whose sole exposure to the film 
has been through faded, deteriorating video copies, the opportunity to 
watch the movie in a manner akin to the one intended by director Alfred 
Hitchcock comes as a great boon.  In fact, aside from the plot itself, 
there are few similarities between the shrunken, battered TV version of 
the film and this painstakingly meticulous restoration.  </P>
<P>     Hitchcock films in general, and VERTIGO in particular (which many 
critics view as the Master of Suspense's greatest achievement), have 
influenced an entire generation of film makers, from Martin Scorsese to 
Brian DePalma and David Lynch.  Hitchcock's innovative use of back-
screen projection and camera tricks (such as simultaneously zooming in 
and tracking out) to enhance suspense and draw the audience deeper into 
the narrative have frequently been emulated, but rarely equaled.  From a 
craft standpoint, VERTIGO represents the director in peak form.</P>
<P>     When observed from a contemporary, 1990s viewpoint, certain plot 
elements of VERTIGO seem dated and naive (in particular, how women and 
the justice system are viewed).  However, for the most part, the film 
holds together surprisingly well even 40 years later.  There are times 
when we're aware that VERTIGO was written for a different audience 
during an earlier era, but this doesn't necessarily detract from the 
film going experience; rather, it helps place the movie in its proper 
historical context.</P>
<P>     VERTIGO opens with a short prologue that details the circumstances 
under which Detective John Ferguson (James Stewart) develops an acute 
case of acrophobia that leads to vertigo whenever he climbs a steep 
flight of stairs or gets more than a few feet above the ground.  After 
leaving the police force because of this condition, John is approached 
by an old acquaintance, ship yard magnate Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), to 
tail his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak).  Gavin is concerned about 
Madeleine's health -- she has frequent black-outs and he believes that 
the spirit of a dead woman is attempting to possess her.</P>
<P>     As John follows Madeleine, watching her day after day, he falls for 
her.  Eventually, the two meet and discover that the attraction is 
mutual.  But even love is not enough to overcome John's vertigo, and he 
is unable to save her from a fall from the top of a church bell tower.  
Madeleine's death causes John to suffer a breakdown, and, during his 
recovery, a chance encounter on the street brings him face-to-face with 
a woman, Judy Barton (Novak), who is the spitting image of his dead 
love.</P>
<P>     Hitchcock does a masterful job blending all of VERTIGO's diverse 
elements together.  It's a love story, a mystery, and a thriller all 
rolled into one.  It deals with issues of obsession, psychological and 
physical paralysis, and the tenuous nature of romantic love.  VERTIGO 
should really be seen more than once to be fully appreciated.  Many of 
the darker, deeper aspects only begin to bubble to the surface on 
subsequent viewings.  </P>
<P>     Stylistically, perhaps the two most noteworthy elements of VERTIGO 
are its distinctive color scheme, which features reds and greens, and 
the memorable, haunting score turned in by composer Bernard Herrmann.  
There are numerous, lengthy passages that pass without dialogue (most of 
these occur while John is trailing Madeleine), and Herrmann's music 
sustains Hitchcock's carefully-crafted tone.  </P>
<P>     James Stewart is perfect for the lead in VERTIGO, playing the sort 
of role he does best -- a tremendously-likable, but otherwise ordinary 
man who finds himself caught up in extraordinary circumstances.  VERTIGO 
ranks alongside IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON 
as examples of Stewart in top form.  As an interesting side note, 
Hitchcock scholars are in general agreement that John is a subconscious 
representation of the director -- a man constantly striving for his own 
image of perfect female beauty. Kim Novak brings the right touch of 
mystery to Madeleine/Judy.  Unattainable and icy in the first role, then 
earthy and troubled in the second, Novak allows us to accept what could 
easily seem to be a cheap plot contrivance.  Barbara Bel Geddes, as 
John's good friend, Midge, and Tom Helmore, as Madeleine's husband, fill 
supporting roles.</P>
<P>     This restoration of VERTIGO serves two crucial purposes.  First, it 
allows all those who have loved the film over the years to once again 
(or perhaps for the first time) view the motion picture in its full 
glory.  Secondly, and more importantly, it preserves a great classic for 
future generations so that movie-goers for decades to come will be able 
to see and appreciate VERTIGO as far more than a fading, deteriorating 
piece of '50s cinema.</P>
