<PRE>                                  THE CLIENT
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Susan Sarandon, Brad Renfro, Tommy Lee Jones, Anthony
LaPaglia, Mary-Louise Parker.
Screenplay:  Akiva Goldsman and Robert Getchell.
Director:  Joel Schumacher.</P>
<P>     The film adaptation of John Grisham's THE CLIENT is in a unique
position.  Commercially, there are probably great expectations; THE
FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF combined to gross over $200 million at the
box office last year.  Artistically, on the other hand, the
expectations are probably much lower, again based on the previous
Grisham adaptations.  Grisham on the screen is like Grisham on the
page:  glossy, undemanding, straight-ahead potboilers, perfect for mass
consumption.  But surprisingly, THE CLIENT is slightly more than that.
Even if the whole does not quite equal the sum of its more impressive
parts, THE CLIENT edges out THE FIRM as the best of the three Grisham
films.</P>
<P>     THE CLIENT is the story of eleven-year-old Mark Sway (Brad
Renfro), a poor Tennessee youth who is in the wrong place at the wrong
time one day.  While out in the woods with his younger brother, Mark
stumbles upon a suicidal Mafia lawyer, who spills some dark secrets to
Mark before he kills himself.  The incident leaves the younger brother
traumatized into a catatonic state, and leaves Mark as the only
witness.  This makes him valuable to publicity-hungry New Orleans
district attorney Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones), and dangerous to
Barry "The Blade" Moldano (Anthony LaPaglia), who stands to lose the
most from Mark's knowledge.  Convinced he needs help, Mark turns to
Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon), a lawyer looking for a second chance, and
who becomes Mark's only hope.</P>
<P>     THE CLIENT, like THE FIRM, benefits most from a wealth of solid
performances.  Susan Sarandon carries herself with the tension of
someone who knows she has made a lot of mistakes and can't afford to
make any more; Tommy Lee Jones does an oilier take on his Sam Gerard
from THE FUGITIVE, with a dash more Southern bluster.  The scenes in
which Sarandon and Jones tangle are masterful, sparks of raw
intelligence flying between the two gifted performers, making it
regrettable that there aren't more.  Newcomer Brad Renfro actually has
far more screen time than either of his big-name co-stars, and he is
occasionally very good, particularly when showing a bit of an edge.
He's less successful when asked to deliver emotion-filled speeches,
like his description of the custody battle between his parents.  The
best performance, however, might be that of Mary- Louise Parker as
Mark's mother.  In many ways it is a better written part than any of
the three leads, rich and complex, and Parker is wonderful in a
scene-stealing supporting role similar to Holly Hunter and David
Strathairn in THE FIRM.</P>
<P>     There is so much good acting going on in THE CLIENT (aside from
Anthony LaPaglia, whose cartoonish Mafioso does everything but grab his
crotch) that it's easy to overlook what a hum-drum thriller it is.
This isn't true of the first half hour, where director Joel Schumacher
keeps the tension notched up high.  The encounter between Mark and the
babbling attorney, intercut with the reactions of the ever more
frightened brother, is extremely effective, and the low-angle
perspective on Mark's confrontation with an obnoxious police officer
creates a heightened paranoia.  Then, as Grisham plots tend to do, THE
CLIENT's sputters out like a released balloon.  The climactic showdown
is abrupt, silly and very unsatisfying, an appropriate wrap-up to a
sluggish second hour.  It almost seems as though Schumacher realized
that the suspense elements were the least interesting, and did only
what was necessary for resolution.</P>
<P>     In fact, THE CLIENT is much more effective as a character study
than it is as a thriller.  The relationship between Mark and Reggie is
intriguing, as Mark realizes he needs to trust someone and Reggie tries
to exorcise the demons of an alcoholism which drove away her children.
But that relationship is a bit rushed, and while both THE FIRM and THE
PELICAN BRIEF overstayed their welcome, THE CLIENT might have benefited
from an additional ten or fifteen minutes of character development.  It
might have made the maudlin closing scene between Reggie and Mark more
tolerable.  Still, THE CLIENT's first- rate cast carries it through its
many lulls.  Provided you aren't heading to see THE CLIENT expecting a
pulse-pounding thriller, its possible you could be in for a pleasant
surprise.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Mafia lawyers:  6.</PRE>
