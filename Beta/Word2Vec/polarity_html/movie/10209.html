<P>TOMORROW NEVER DIES *** (out of four)

<P>starring Pierce Brosnan, Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Pryce, Teri Hatcher
written by Bruce Fierstein
directed by Roger Spottiswoode</P>
<P>Let's face it: the $100 million-plus smash that was "Goldeneye" was
not a good film by any means, and as a Bond movie was only marginally
better than, say, "A View To A Kill" or either of the Timothy Dalton
pictures, by virtue of nice pacing. But it did revive the series, and
granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it (ie.
the new "M" is a woman). "Tomorrow Never Dies" is the picture
"Goldeneye" should have been; it's also the most entertaining Bond
outing since "The Spy Who Loved Me".</P>
<P>The new picture opens with China considering war with Britain after a
standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from
an English submarine. As an attack occurs, the front-page headline is
already being prepared, courtesy of Carver media. Carver (Pryce) the
man is a deluded magnate, a sort of hybrid of Ted Turner, Bill Gates,
and Peter Sellars' German scientist from "Dr. Strangelove"
(physically, Pryce even recalls Sellars in his Kubrick days). It's up
to James Bond to take him down, with assistance, of course, from a
wealth of gadgets (including a multi-purpose cell phone), and
beautiful women. Enter Michelle Yeoh, fresh from "Supercop", as a
Chinese secret agent with her own agenda; with effortless grace, she
cat burgles, dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing
pasta, and refuses the advances of our philandering hero. They make a
great team.</P>
<P>"Tomorrow Never Dies" is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient
film, given that at the helm is none other than the director of
"Turner & Hooch". Spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set
pieces, each much more intricate and impressive than, for instance,
the tank scene in "Goldeneye". Moreover, Brosnan has at last settled
into the role some feel he was born to play; last time out, the fate
of the franchise rested on his shoulders, and there was noticeable
discomfort in his body language. Returned in Brosnan's eyes has some
of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on TV's
"Remington Steele", as has his deadpan wit. And though Carver's
motives are muddy (when Carver explains that "genius is insanity with
some success", screenwriter Fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut),
Pryce makes an agreeable, memorable villain. In the future, they
should pursue actors as talented and experienced as Pryce to breathe
life into these cardboard figures.</P>
<P>There a few too many explosions in "Tomorrow Never Dies", perhaps so
many they qualify as dialogue. And it could have used a sharper
script, though I was amused by the double entendres, none of which I
will reveal here. As it stands, the plot suffers many holes (I'm not
taking about implausibilities), and the dialogue tends towards the
hackneyed. Now that the elements are in place: modern special effects
and stunt work, cool Pierce Brosnan, kickass female allies... it's
time to put them to use in something truly special. There's no
mistaking, however, that "Tomorrow Never Dies" is ideal holiday
escapism, and for the first time in perhaps years, you'll walk out
wanting more Bond movies.
