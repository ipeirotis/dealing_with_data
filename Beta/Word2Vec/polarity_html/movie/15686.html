Dustin Putman's Film Reviews</A> ></P>
<P>"Very Bad Things," is the most delightfully morbid film of the year, a 
movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and 
violence that I couldn't help but be won over by the material.</P>
<P>The film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in Los Angeles 
for a bachelor party in Las Vegas. The groom-to-be is Kyle Fisher (Jon 
Favreau), who is about to be married to the controlling, 
wedding-obsessed Laura (Cameron Diaz). The other friends are real estate 
agent Robert Boyd (Christian Slater), quiet Charles (Leland Orser), and 
brothers, Michael (Jeremy Piven) and family man Adam (Daniel Stern). 
After a wild night of gambling, boozing, and drugs, a stripper (Carla 
Scott) who was paid for by Robert comes into their hotel room, but after 
a freak accident, to everyone's terror, she is killed. As Robert puts 
it: "There are two options: go to the police and go to prison, or bury 
her out in the desert where no one will ever find her." After a security 
guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body, Robert 
is forced to kill him as well. "Okay, there is only one option now. You 
can forget about calling the police," he says. By the time the five 
friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer, most of them are 
overcome with guilt, which sets off an even more elaborate series of 
event, that includes much, much more murder, double-crosses, and the 
inevitable wedding from hell.</P>
<P>"Very Bad Things," which is actor Peter Berg's feature film directing 
debut, is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that, "There's 
Something About Mary," wanted to be. It pulls out all the stops to 
create something fresh, original, and hilarious, even if that requires 
surprisingly graphic violence, gore, and a slew of truly hateful 
characters that all get what they deserve by the end. </P>
<P>The screenplay, also written by Berg, is, to put it mildly, very funny 
and courageous. During the second act of the film, some of the fun was 
beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death, which was beginning 
to undermine the humor, but it eventually recouped itself with a climax 
that has to be seen to be believed. The dialogue is edgy and inventive, 
and this film proves that a movie doesn't necessarily require likable 
character to be extremely enjoyable. There's more fun, I think, in 
showing ignorable people getting their just desserts.</P>
<P>Cameron Diaz gives her best performance to date here, and has a lot of 
fun in playing the hateful Laura, who eventually turns out to be more 
crazy than any of the five male friends. Diaz puts so much overblown 
energy to her character that I really do think she deserves a supporting 
actress Oscar nomination come next January. By the time she is beating 
someone to death with a coat hanger, and reciting lines like, "stuff him 
in the crapper and get your ass upstairs," I couldn't help but crack up 
at how "balls-to-the-wall" this film had become. Jeanne Tripplehorn 
creates another character original, as Daniel Stern's wife, who late in 
the picture, we discover, is a tough kick-boxer that should not be 
messed around with. </P>
<P>It is at this level that, "Very Bad Things," was so entertaining and 
surprising. Just when you thought you could predict what was going to 
happen, there would be a little twist involving the characters that 
would be absolutely wacky. The last sequence was perfect and managed to 
go even further over-the-top. Although I enjoyed the film immensely, let 
me make this clear: "Very Bad Things," is not a movie for everyone. It 
is more tasteless than anything I have ever seen, it is more violent and 
bloody than a R-rated film usually is, and it is offensive. Luckily, 
these are elements that I would prefer in a comedy, since it clearly 
shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred, politically 
incorrect comedy. The fact that this film slipped through the cracks of 
the usually mainstream and "safe" wide-releases coming out lately, still 
gives me hope for the Hollywood film industry.</P>
