<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A dull and oppressingly long three-hour ode to the glory of war and
killing. It's about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor produced by the
schlockmeister himself, Jerry Bruckheimer, and directed by-the-numbers
by Michael Bay ("The Rock"/"Armageddon"). This strictly commercial
film's budget was for $135 million and uses as its model for financial
success "Titanic" and its anti-historical way of telling its historical
story. It's a film made for the huge crowds it hopes to pull in, by
giving them all the goo they could possibly ingest in one sitting. It
ran a cliché romance story for two hours worth of the film and after 80
minutes of this corny love story, the Japanese at last attack Pearl
Harbor and the film to its credit accurately gets the chaos of the
events right (the only thing it got right in the film). This invasion
was the heart of the film and lasted for about 40 minutes; it got its
money's worth in good airplane battle footage from the
computer-generated imagery (though the scene itself had a flatness that
made it appear uninvolving but competenly done; there was no emotional
resonance to any of the action; it was respected for its technical
achievement rather than for being artistic). For the last third of the
film you could have skipped out and missed nothing, because it went back
to that annoying love story it was hammering out.</P>
<P>Every thing about this film was second rate; especially, when compared
to modern war films such as "Saving Private Ryan." The trite dialogue,
inept script, misuse of history, irritating character portrayals, the
soapy background music, and the clanky acting by everyone concerned,
made this overlong work into a critical bomb. The main characters were
either boring gung-ho militarists with serious personal disorders or
all-American beauties posing as super-dedicated nurses, whose only other
interest besides nursing was hunting a man down. Every character was a
stock character seen in many other Hollywood films. The funniest moment
in the film, which was a purely Hollywood fictional moment and meant to
be deadly serious, had a heavily puffed up latex faced FDR (Jon Voight)
climb out of his wheelchair to rally his White House advisers after the
attack. I couldn't help myself from laughing, it was such a silly
attempt at patriotism. After the attack and FDR's stirring "A Date Which
Will Live in Infamy" speech to the nation, the country was prepared for
war and phony scenes such as the FDR one was misleading as well as
revolting.</P>
<P>The film opens in 1923 and shows farmboys Rafe (Affleck) and Danny
(Hartnett) as best friends in Tennessee, only interested in airplanes.
That's about as deep as we get into their characters. They join the
United States Army Air Corps in 1941 and both show an ability at being
hotshot pilots while training under the command of Jimmy Doolittle
(Baldwin), in Long Island. Rafe passes the eye test, despite his
apparent dyslexia, on the mercy of pretty nurse Evelyn Johnson (British
actress, Kate Beckinsale), accepting his pompous speech to her how he's
the best pilot in the world. Kate has fine features and virtuous good
looks, and an empty expression that is the same both for love of Rafe
and of country. He gets to meet her after he takes an extra immunization
shot in the butt and he falls on his nose. They fall in love during
their brief few weeks of courtship, but he volunteers to join a British
Eagle Squadron to help them stop Hitler's Luftwaffe invasion of their
country. News comes back that he was killed in action when his plane was
shot down in the ocean. The shy Danny then falls in love with Evelyn,
and he soon makes love with her under one of many white parachutes left
on the ground. The romantic triangle becomes gooey when Rafe comes back
alive and he tells how he was rescued at sea and remained in
Nazi-occupied France. Trouble between the best buddies results when
Danny tries to explain to Rafe in an Hawaiian nightspot what happened
and the two get into a brawl requiring MP's to break it up. Rafe acts
irrationally, believing his buddy stabbed him in the back and is angry
at both Evelyn and Danny. But all three of them are at Pearl Harbor on,
Dec. 7, 1941, the day the Japanese under Admiral Yamamoto (Mako) attack,
and the two heroically work together to fight back from the sneak attack
by engaging in dog fights with the enemy. Evelyn is splendid in the
bloody hospital, never even getting one hair out of place as she rushes
around treating the maimed. The most memorable scene from the attack, is
the hundred or so sailors from the U.S.S. Arizona entombed below and are
down too far to be rescued as they died scratching out for help.</P>
<P>The attack starts off by showing the 350 Japanese bombers coming in
formation through the early morning sunshine as housewives hang their
clothes on the lines and children play baseball. The bombers then go on
to attack the American ships grouped-together, planes on the ground, and
personnel in almost the same time frame the real attack occurred. The
film plays it safe and lays no blame on why Pearl Harbor was so
unprotected. Admiral Kimmel (Feore) can only say the War Department's
warning of an attack came an hour too late. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Dorie
Miller, a real-life cook aboard the U.S.S. Arizona, whose heroics during
the attack made him the first African-American to receive the Navy
Cross. His story in the film is reduced to using him as a demographic.
Miller's story is shot in a number of brief scenes: he wins a boxing
match against a burly white guy, tells Evelyn he wants respect and wants
to fire the weapons instead of being a cook in the segregated military,
is complimented by his commanding officer for his boxing skills and
later comforts him when he's dying, and shoots down a plane. No
character in the film had any shading or depth, everyone was a
forgettable personality. The Kate Beckinsale was particularly empty, we
never find out her history or anything about her. We only know her
father was a pilot.</P>
<P>The last third of the film has the two men assigned to Colonel
Doolittle's secret mission, where they bomb Tokyo (actually Gary,
Indiana steel mills) to show them that we're ready to take them on and
show them what we're all about. Evelyn waits back at a military base for
them to return, but there's no excitement about anything in this film,
including who she chooses as her man. The one-dimensional characters
just say their lines and the film keeps moving along. Though this film
failed in every which way to provide a history lesson, or an engaging
story, or be an entertaining film; still I'm afraid it will have
box-office success. It reduced everything to the lowest commom
denominator by the crass Bruckheimer rules for commercial success (keep
the dialogue banal and down to the film's theme, and keep everything in
motion so no ideas could get in the way of the mindless violence on the
screen; this way it remains on a fourth grade level and can be easily
understood by the masses). It would be difficult to make a film more
shallow than this one; but, I'm cynically looking forward to Bay and
Bruckheimer teaming up again, I think they have the potential to stoop
lower than they have so far (because as bad as this film was, it could
have been worst).</P>
