<PRE>MULAN
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with
the release of their latest animated adventure, Mulan.  While it adheres
a bit too close to the Disney formula to be perfect, it is nonetheless
an entertaining film for both kids and adults.</P>
<P>Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen, singing: Lea Salonga) wants nothing more than to
be a dutiful daughter and honor her family...it's just that she doesn't
quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time.  While most girls her
age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local
matchmaker (Miriam Margoyles), Mulan would prefer speaking her mind.</P>
<P>But there is trouble on the horizon.  The evil Huns, led by Shan-Yu
(Miguel Ferrer), are invading China.  The Emperor (Pat Morita) has
decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army.  The
only male in Mulan's family is her father, Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh), who,
old and with a bad leg, honorably accepts his fate.  Mulan, on the other
hand, decides to save her father's life...by secretly masquerading as a
man and taking his place on the battlefield.</P>
<P>Mulan, under the assumed name of Ping, appears at camp where she, along
with the other bumbling recruits, Yao (Harvey Fierstein), Chien-Po
(Jerry Tondo) and Ling (Gedde Watanabe), are trained in the art of war
by Captain Shang (B.D. Wong, singing: Donny Osmond).  But she's not
alone in her tasks...in typical Disney fashion, she has three animal
companions:  her horse Khan, a lucky cricket Crickey, and a pint-sized
"guardian" dragon called Mushu (Eddie Murphy).</P>
<P>Much like the gargoyles in The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the humor in
Mulan is lukewarm and doesn't flow well with the rest of the more
serious story.  Sure, some occasional comic relief is welcome,
particularly in a film geared for the younger set, but Mulan overdoes
it.  The overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great
film into a good, but schizophrenic experience.</P>
<P>But, that commentary aside, this is a very well made film (which makes
the formulaic additions all the more regrettable). The animation is on
par with some of Disney's best.  The story itself is interesting, and
the action scenes are awe-inspiring.</P>
<P>The musical score to the film is enjoyable, though, as has been the case
with Disney's recent work, the songs are mostly forgettable. At least,
we're only subjected to four of them this time around.</P>
<P>Mulan boasts the highest death toll of any Disney cartoon to date. Most
of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized (there's
nothing to compare with the death of Mufasa or Bambi's mom). There's
nothing graphic, and the film resides snugly inside a G rating. Children
will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs
than of the slaughter of armies.</P>
<P>It's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered
because of its strict adherence to Disney tradition.  If the filmmakers
had the guts to lessen the humor, ax the compulsory songs, and remove
the obligatory (and somewhat unrealistic) romance, they could have had a
classic on their hands. Instead, they merely deliver a very good time at
the movies.</P>
