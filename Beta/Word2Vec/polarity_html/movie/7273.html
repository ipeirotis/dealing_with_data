<P>     THAT OLD FEELING is a formulaic romantic comedy that doesn't have 
the decency to give us any real chemistry between the members of about 
five mix-and-match couples.  While it's generally expected that all but 
the top echelon of entries into this genre are going to rely upon stock 
situations and familiar plot turns, the difference between an enjoyable 
romantic comedy and a wearisome one is whether sparks are evident in the 
character interaction.  And, although THAT OLD FEELING features almost 
everybody with more than one partner, nothing ever clicks.  So we're 
left with a tired story that goes to sleep after only about twenty-five 
minutes.</P>
<P>     Of course, some of the matches aren't supposed to work.  Take, for 
example, the marriage of Dan (Dennis Farina) and Rowena DeMauro (Gail 
O'Grady).  Although these two have been together for fourteen years, 
anything more substantial than tolerance has long since drained out of 
their union.  Then there's Dan's ex, actress Lilly Leonard (Better 
Midler), whose second husband, Alan (David Rasche) is one of those 
whiny, feel-good therapists.  Finally, there's Molly (Paula Marshall), a 
twenty-something woman with no apparent career or direction in life, who 
has decided to marry would-be politician Keith (Jamie Denton), because 
he's the safe choice.</P>
<P>     In fact, Molly and Keith's wedding is where the "action" begins.  
You see, according to the bride, her parents hate each other with "a 
nuclear capability."  Sure enough, after a brief try at civilized 
conversation, their repartee devolves into a screaming match, which, in 
turn, leads to a heated kiss.  Soon, Dan and Lilly are steaming up the 
inside of his sports car.  Later, they sneak off together for a wild 
affair in New York City.  Horrified that her parents' behavior might 
hurt her new husband's election chances (he's running on a family values 
platform), Molly sets off in pursuit, but, the longer she follows them, 
the more she realizes how dull her own love life is.  Then, on top of 
that, she starts to fall for a tabloid photographer (Danny Nucci) who's 
helping her locate her delinquent mother and father.</P>
<P>     Part of the problem with THAT OLD FEELING is that the main story -- 
the reunion between Dan and Lilly -- can't sustain the movie.  Once 
they've stopped hurling insults and started kissing, that aspect of the 
film is dead-in-the-water.  There's no place for it to go, except back 
to insults, then to more kissing, like a yo-yo.  Hence,  in order to pad 
things out to feature length, we have the who's-Molly-going-to-end-up-
with subplot (as if we didn't know from the first moment Danny Nucci 
walks on screen).  This might have worked if the characters had been a 
little more interesting (she's boring; he's goofy, but not in an 
endearing way) or if the actors had connected.  While TV regular Paula 
Marshall and Nucci (CRIMSON TIDE, THE ROCK) look good, that's not 
enough.</P>
<P>     At least Bette Midler and Dennis Farina (GET SHORTY) have their 
moments, although Dan and Lilly seem better suited to be good friends 
than lovers.  Their arguments are forced and mechanical and their sex 
scenes are awkward, but they develop a genuine camaraderie while they're 
walking the streets of New York, slipping through a hotel lobby, and 
eating dinner.  Midler and Farina could probably be very good in these 
roles if the script didn't limit them so badly.  </P>
<P>     THAT OLD FEELING was directed by veteran Carl Reiner (father of 
Rob), who used to helm all of Steve Martin's feature projects, and 
hasn't done much of note since ALL OF ME.  Surprisingly for Reiner, 
who's a funny man, there aren't many laughs in THAT OLD FEELING.  In 
fact, had this film turned into the madcap, screwball endeavor it 
occasionally tries to be, maybe the numerous flaws wouldn't have been so 
obvious.  As it is, however, THAT OLD FEELING is just another example of 
a romantic comedy stuck using those old cliches in familiar and 
uninteresting ways.</P>
