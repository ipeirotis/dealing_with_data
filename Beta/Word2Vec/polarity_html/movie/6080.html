<P>     Every war, revolution, or military action has its own atrocity 
tales.  It doesn't matter whether the perpetrators are Romans, Nazi, 
Serbs, or some other group -- horror is horror, no matter who commits 
it.  With THE MAN BY THE SHORE, director Raoul Peck has personalized one 
such tragedy.  The strength of this film lies not so much in the actual 
story, but in the manner of its telling.</P>
<P>     The place is Haiti in the 1960s.  Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier has 
just seized control of the country.  His army of sinister Tontons 
Macoutes roam the countryside, doling out terror and brutality with 
impunity.  Eight year old Sarah (Jennifer Zubar) and her two older 
sisters are victims of Duvalier's reign.  Once, her father was a 
respected Captain in the military, but, when a Macoutes named Janvier 
(Jean-Michel Martial) came into power in the region, Sarah's father and 
mother had to flee the country or face execution.  The three children 
went into hiding, first in a convent, then in the attic of their 
grandmother (Toto Bissainthe), a proud woman who refuses to kowtow to 
Janvier.</P>
<P>     The timeframe switches back and forth between the movie's "present" 
and events that took place two years previously, when Sarah saw her 
father and godfather tortured and beaten by Janvier.  The torture scene, 
shown in flashback, is especially disturbing, not so much because it is 
excessively graphic (gore in movies these days can rarely be considered 
shocking), but because of the chilling nonchalance with which Janvier 
dispenses his brand of "justice."  And little Sarah, standing on a 
nearby balcony, sees everything.  These are images that never leave her, 
and their haunting presence impels the film's climax.</P>
<P>     THE MAN BY THE SHORE is an examination of two universally-
recognized maxims:  "power corrupts" and "to live by the sword is to die 
by it."  Janvier is a truly reprehensible character -- a villain without 
charisma.  There is nothing remotely charming about his brand of evil.  
This isn't the kind of man whom you love to hate; you simply hate him.  
Power is his, and he regularly abuses it.  He takes bribes, commits 
murders, and rapes little girls.  A dead body lies on the floor of his 
barracks, waiting for someone to take it away.</P>
<P>     Janvier's chief adversary is Sarah's grandmother, Camille, who, in 
his words, "incites subversion".  Although she has no real power, her 
calm, confident manner commands respect, even from someone like Janvier.  
He wants to capture the children, but is wary of crossing Camille.  Even 
though she poses no tangible physical or political threat, she is 
nevertheless a formidable enemy because of the strength of her 
personality, and Sarah looks to her as an impervious shield in a 
shifting, violent world.</P>
<P>     One of the great strengths of THE MAN BY THE SHORE is how it 
contrasts everyday activities -- adults running stores, children playing 
games or riding bicycles to the seashore -- with the ever-lurking 
savageness that threatens to explode without provocation.  Peck has 
drawn from his own childhood memories to make this film, and the results 
evoke powerful emotions.  A small, overlooked film, THE MAN BY THE SHORE 
deserves to be seen by all who don't shrink from gut-wrenchingly genuine 
accounts of disturbing events.</P>
