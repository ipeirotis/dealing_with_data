<P>     I've got to be honest with you:  if I were producing a "true crime"
bio-pic, Richard Linklater would not be my first choice as director.  In
fact, I'm not sure he'd make the top fifty.  This is, after all, the man
who chronicled the meandering SLACKER culture, the man who followed DAZED
AND CONFUSED 1970s youth in their hazy misadventures, the man who let two
young lovers talk the night away BEFORE SUNRISE.  Not exactly the stuff of
which blazing shootouts and narrow getaways are made, is it?</P>
<P>     As one might expect, there is an amiable, unhurried pace to Richard
Linklater's THE NEWTON BOYS.  The surprise is that it turns out to be one
of the film's most appealing qualities.  Based on Claude Stanush's
non-fiction book, THE NEWTON BOYS tells the story of the most successful
gang of bank robbers in American history:  Texas siblings Willis (Matthew
McConaughey), Jess (Ethan Hawke), Joe (Skeet Ulrich) and Dock Newton
(Vincent D'Onfrio), along with their explosives expert Brentwood Glasscock
(Dwight Yoakam).  In the early 1920s, the five men went on an unparalleled
spree throughout the West and Midwest, working at night and reaping the
rewards of the last remaining easily-accessed safes in left in the
country.</P>
<P>     From the opening credits, it is clear that Linklater is aiming for an
old-fashioned whimsy in his telling of the tale.  The title cards are
styled after silent films, with "The Players" introduced in sienna-tinted
head shots, tipping their hats to the camera.  THE NEWTON BOYS generally
paints its protagonists as light-hearted, almost casual outlaws, polite
young men who happened to be very good at robbing banks and milked one
effective modus operandi for all it was worth.  The script (by Linklater,
Stanush and Clark Lee Walker) shows little interest in digging deep into
the characters' psyches or exposing the gritty violence of the Old West's
final days.  Though the climactic train robbery features a bit of
bloodshed, far more typical is a scene where a bungled daylight heist
turns into a comedy of errors resulting in nothing worse than a couple of
flesh wounds.  Even the obligatory montage sequence, spinning newspaper
headlines and all, is edited with a less frantic sense of urgency than you
might expect.</P>
<P>     THE NEWTON BOYS is such a lightweight bit of history that it
sometimes threatens to float away entirely whenever there's not a robbery
going on.  The characters are energetically portrayed by the top-notch
cast, but they're little more than a token trait a piece -- Joe is the
Religious One, Brentwood is the Cautious One, Jess is the Cocky Drunken
One, Dock is...well, the _other_ Cocky Drunken One.  Only McConaughey is
given a bit more to work with, playing Willis as a wronged man
rationalizing his lawlessness as payback to the world.  Even then, the
attempts to flesh out his life -- a romance with a single mother (Julianna
Margulies), ill-fated attempts to funnel his ill-gotten gains into
legitimate businesses -- feel half-hearted and only sporadically
effective.</P>
<P>     Still, there's something undeniably charming about THE NEWTON BOYS,
some intangible alchemy between the actors' obvious enjoyment of their
roles and a story with no greater agenda than spotlighting a previously
unknown bit of Americana.  Two hours may be a bit too much time to support
the substance of THE NEWTON BOYS, but if you've indulged Linklater's
episodic films in the past, you probably won't be disappointed by his
willingness to wander down the side roads of a story.  Not a bad choice at
all, as it turns out, for a story about some nice young fellas who just
happen to rob banks.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Newtonian out-laws:  7.</PRE>
