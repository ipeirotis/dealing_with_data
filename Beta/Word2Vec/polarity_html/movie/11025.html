<P>     It wouldn't be a stretch to name legendary Japanese film maker 
Akira Kurosawa as one of the ten greatest motion picture directors of 
all time.  Kurosawa's brilliant work speaks for itself, and, with over 
five decades of movie making to his credit, he has more than earned his 
place alongside the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergman, Martin 
Scorsese, and anyone else who belongs in such lofty company.  And, like 
all of the best directors, Kurosawa did not produce his movies with an 
elite audience in mind.  Though always intelligent, his body of work 
plays as well to the "average" movie-goer as it does to the true 
cineaste.  That's the reason why Hollywood has plundered Kurosawa's 
pictures on a regular basis.  His THE SEVEN SAMURAI was remade into one 
of the greatest Westerns ever -- THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.  YOJIMBO has 
received two American treatments -- A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and LAST MAN 
STANDING.  THE HIDDEN FORTRESS was one of the inspirations behind George 
Lucas' STAR WARS.  And RASHOMON's unique approach to divergent 
narratives became a linchpin for COURAGE UNDER FIRE.  </P>
<P>     Kurosawa began his career in 1943 with a movie called SUGATA 
SANSHIRO, about a boy learning the meaning of life through judo.  Over 
the next several years, Kurosawa became one of his country most prolific 
and respected film makers.  In 1948, with the film DRUNKEN ANGEL, he 
first collaborated with actor Toshiro Mifune, beginning a director/actor 
partnership that would span decades and prove highly rewarding for both 
men.  RASHOMON, made in 1950, was the pair's fifth movie together, and 
the film that first garnered Kurosawa widespread international attention 
(it won the 1952 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar).  </P>
<P>     The story told by RASHOMON is both surprisingly simple and 
deceptively complex.  The central tale, which tells of the rape of a 
woman (Machiko Kyo) and the murder of a man (Masayuki Mori), possibly by 
a bandit (Toshiro Mifune), is presented entirely in flashbacks from the 
perspectives of four narrators.  The framing portions of the movie 
transpire at Kyoto's crumbling Rashomon gate, where several people seek 
shelter from a pelting rain storm and discuss the recent crime, which 
has shocked the region.  One of the men, a woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), 
was a witness to the events, and, with the help of a priest (Minoru 
Chiaki), he puzzles over what really happened, and what such a horrible 
occurrence says about human nature.</P>
<P>     In each of the four versions of the story, the characters are the 
same, as are many of the details.  But much is different, as well.  In 
the first account, that of the bandit, the criminal accepts culpability 
for the murder but refutes the charge of rape, saying that it was an act 
of mutual consent.  The woman's story affirms that the bandit attacked 
her, but indicates that she may have been the murderess.  The dead man's 
tale (told through a medium) claims rape and suicide.  The only 
"impartial" witness, the woodcutter, weaves a story that intertwines 
elements of the other three, leaving the viewer wondering if he truly 
saw anything at all.</P>
<P>     Many people watch RASHOMON with the intent of piecing together a 
picture of what really occured.  However, the accounts are so divergent 
that such an approach seems doomed to futility.  RASHOMON isn't about 
determining a chronology of what happened in the woods.  It's not about 
culpability or innocence.  Instead, it focuses on something far more 
profound and thought-provoking:  the inability of any one man to know 
the truth, no matter how clearly he thinks he sees things.  Perspective 
distorts reality and makes the absolute truth unknowable.</P>
<P>     All of the narrators in RASHOMON tell compelling and believable 
stories, but, for a variety of reasons, each of them must be deemed 
unreliable.  It's impossible to determine to what degree their versions 
are fabrications, and how many discrepancies are the result of 
legitimate differences in points-of-view.  It's said that four witnesses 
to an accident will all offer different accounts of the same event, but 
there are things in RASHOMON (namely, that each of the three 
participants names himself or herself as the murderer) that cannot be 
explained away on this basis.  And the impressions of the "impartial" 
observer further muddy the waters, because, despite his protestations 
that he doesn't lie, we trust his tale the least.  </P>
<P>     In the end, we are left recognizing only one thing:  that there is 
no such thing as an objective truth.  It is a grail to be sought after, 
but which will never be found, only approximated.  Kurosawa's most 
brilliant move in RASHOMON is never to reveal what really happened.  We 
are left to make our own deductions.  Every time I watch the film, I 
come away with a slightly different opinion of what transpired in the 
woods.  But not knowing remains a source of fascination, not one of 
frustration, and therein lies Kurosawa's greatest achievement.</P>
<P>     It's worth saying something about the style employed by the 
director.  The tone and approach of RASHOMON are radically different 
from anything Western viewers are likely to be familiar with.  The film 
is presented almost as visual poetry, paying a great deal of attention 
to sights and images while sound and dialogue have lesser importance.  
The cinematography is singularly evocative.  It would be possible to 
watch RASHOMON without subtitles and still capture more than a small 
fraction of its essence.  Likewise, this film could have probably been 
equally successful during the silent era.  Nowhere is this more evident 
than in one standout, 3 1/2 minute sequence:  a kaleidoscope of black-
and-white images accompanied only by Fumio Hayasaka's evocative score as 
the woodcutter makes his way into the woods and discovers the dead body.</P>
<P>     As has been true throughout his entire career, Kurosawa draws the 
best performances out of his actors.  As the brash rogue at the center 
of the controversy, Toshiro Mifune is wonderfully robust.  He shades his 
character differently in each of the four versions, presenting an 
individual who is unmistakably the same man, yet subtly different.  We 
see the bandit not only as he sees himself, but through the eyes of 
three others, as well.  That's the brilliance of Kurosawa's vision and 
Mifune's performance.  Equally good is Masayuki Mori as the doomed 
noble.  Depending on who is telling the story, he can appear good and 
noble or cowardly.  Once again, the differences serve to emphasize that 
this is the same person seen from different perspectives.</P>
<P>     The most striking portrayal, however, belongs to the radiant 
Machiko Kyo, whose mesmerizing, seductive character varies the most from 
narrative to narrative.  She can be wholesome, treacherous, sexy, 
sympathetic, or vicious.  Depending on who's painting her portrait, she 
is a victim, a manipulator, an innocent, or a vixen.  At times, she's 
"like a child trying to be serious"; at others, she's "fierce."  As good 
as Mifune and Mori are, they are constantly upstaged by Kyo.  In casting 
her, an unknown at the time, Kurosawa knew what he was doing.</P>
<P>     Today, nearly fifty years after it was made, RASHOMON has lost none 
of its fascination or power.  It's still a marvelous piece of cinema 
that asks unanswerable questions of great import.  Films like COURAGE 
UNDER FIRE may capture some of the spirit of RASHOMON, but no movie 
before or since has presented these issues in quite the same unique and 
intense fashion.  In every sense of the word, this is a true classic.  
It's hard to find a more rewarding way to spend ninety minutes.</P>
