<P>     You have to believe that Christopher Guest is a smart enough guy to
realize he's setting himself up for some tough comparisons. The legendary
mock documentary THIS IS SPINAL TAP, co-starring and co-written by Guest,
is making a return appearance to theaters to remind viewers that it was
the funniest comedy of the 1980s; Guest also co-wrote and directed WAITING
FOR GUFFMAN, another very funny mock documentary. It's a format that's
been good for Guest, and you can't blame him for returning to the well,
especially when venturing outside it to direct has resulted in garbage
like the Chris Farley/Matthew Perry debacle ALMOST HEROES. But you have to
wonder when his luck will run out. How many mock documentaries can one
director fit on the head of a pin?</P>
<P>     BEST IN SHOW is a very entertaining film comedy on a pure laugh
meter, but it's missing something SPINAL TAP and GUFFMAN both had to
spare: a real perspective on its subject, and genuine affection for its
characters. The setting is the world of dog shows, specifically the
prestigious Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show in Philadelphia. The
"documentary" follows several participants through their travels to and
preparation for the show. Gerry (Eugene Levy) and Cookie Fleck (Catherine
O'Hara) drive up from Florida with their Norwich terrier Winky; 
high-strung yuppie couple Hamilton (Michael Hitchcock) and Meg Swan 
(Parker Posey) bring their equally high-strung Weimeraner Beatrice; North
Carolina fishing supply store owner Harlan Pepper (Guest) comes with his
young bloodhound Hubert. And there's two-time defending champion Rhapsody
in White, a standard poodle owned by trophy wife Sheri Ann Cabot (Jennifer
Coolidge) and handled by veteran trainer Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch).</P>
<P>     As has been the case in Guest's other mockumentaries, BEST IN SHOW
starts with some broadly comic characters to get the gags rolling. Gerry
does plenty of slow burns while man after man relates his sexual history
with Cookie. The braces-wearing Swans freak out over every bump in their
lives. There is also a gay couple (Michael McKean and John Michael 
Higgins) who raise Shih tzus, the latter of whom swishes about and
dispenses double-entendre about pepperoni. Lots of the dialogue -- much of
it obviously improvised -- is hilarious, especially when it involves
absurdities like Harlan's interest in ventriloquism or Gerry's (literal) 
two left feet. If you just sit back and listen, the laughs will keep
coming.</P>
<P>     The laughs should have been richer, however, and there's a reason
they're not. In SPINAL TAP and GUFFMAN, the broad characters were only the
starting point for people that eventually became much more human and
sympathetic as we come to understand their world. Guest never seems nearly
as interested in the complexities of his characters or their world in BEST
IN SHOW. There's no sense for why people become so obsessed with putting
their pets through the show-dog grind, no real affection for their quirks
or insecurities. In fact, he plays downright nasty with Sheri Ann and the
Swans in particular, making them fairly grotesque caricatures. There's a
sense that Guest has picked a milieu where he knew there would be a lot of
weird people, and decided simply to wring the laughs out of their
weirdness.</P>
<P>     There are plenty of laughs to be wrung out of that weirdness,
fortunately, and even more to be wrung from the show itself. BEST IN SHOW
gets a tremendous boost once Fred Willard shows up as the Mayflower show's
loud-mouthed announcer Buck Laughlin, whose inane questions for his
flustered British co-host provide nearly non-stop laughs. Laughlin is also
one of the few characters whose ridiculousness is accompanied by a wink; 
he's a guy doing a job he's utterly unqualified for, embarrassing himself
while trying to make the best of it. Willard is brilliant, and the rest of
BEST IN SHOW is still pretty funny. It's simply funny in a slightly more
mean-spirited way, making it harder to embrace unreservedly. Guest has
scored again, but this time there's a less welcome sort of "mock" in his
mock documentary.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 puppy loves:  7.</PRE>
