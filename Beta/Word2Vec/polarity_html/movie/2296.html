<P>     There's a lot of Academy Award potential in WRESTLING ERNEST
HEMINGWAY.  Not only is the cast a virtual who's-who of past nominees
and winners in the acting categories, but director Randa Haines was
responsible for the highly-regarded William Hurt/Marlee Matlin drama
CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD.</P>
<P>     Frank (Richard Harris) and Walt (Robert Duvall) are both loners.
Frank is something of a loose cannon--he answers the door in the nude,
gets drunk on Irish whiskey, and tells stories about a time in 1938
when he wrestled Ernest Hemingway.  Walt, on the other hand, is neat
and orderly.  Twice daily he goes to the local Sweetwater Diner, where
he orders a bacon sandwich from a pretty waitress named Elaine (Sandra
Bullock), for whom he secretly carries a torch.  Then, one day in a
park, Frank meets Walt, and neither of their lives will be the same.
For each of them, the other means something they don't have--a
friend.</P>
<P>     WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY shows what an excellent cast can do
with an average script.  Steve Conrad's debut screenplay says little
that hasn't been presented before, but the actors make it seem fresher
and more powerful than it has a right to be.  Stripped down to its
essentials, this is a buddy film that also tackles the issue of coping
with old age and its accompanying loss of virility.  There's no attempt
to break new ground, and no sense that the script is willing to take
chances.  You can predict the ending long before it comes to pass.</P>
<P>     Robert Duvall always assures a director of a solid performance,
and Walt is one of his best-acted roles in years.  Even though Duvall
is easily twenty years younger than his character, there's never a
credibility problem.  He plays Walt with a simple sensitivity that's at
times poignant or humorous.  Duvall's abilities are so chameleon-like
that it's difficult to believe that this is the same man from another
current release, GERONIMO.  "Oscar-worthy" is an overused term, but it
applies in this case.</P>
<P>     It's been a long time since Richard Harris turned in a bad day's
work (possibly ORCA, and that was fifteen years ago).  Not many of his
films have been box office successes, but Harris' performances have
never been the problem.  WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY adds another
feather to his cap.  Harris' Frank isn't developed with the subtlety of
Duvall's Walt, but Frank is a much more boisterous and raucous
personality.  Harris knows who he's playing, and succeeds brilliantly
in bringing him to life.</P>
<P>     The three women have supporting roles.  Sandra Bullock is likable
as Elaine, the only under-fifty member of the cast.  Shirley MacLaine
doesn't have much to do as Helen Coonie, but she asserts her presence
effectively in two pivotal scenes.  Piper Laurie's Georgia is pretty
much a wasted character, and Ms. Laurie's performance is the only one
that's below the expected level.</P>
<P>     As is the case with many movies that deal with friendship and
aging issues, WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY doesn't go anywhere.  That's
not really a problem, but the total length of the movie could have been
cut by about fifteen minutes without losing anything.  This film
doesn't need to be two hours long.</P>
<P>     Humor and pathos are nicely mixed, but this is expected from any
moderately-successful entry into the genre.  In may ways, this is the
male version of THE CEMETERY CLUB, with many of the same themes
confronted from the other gender's point-of-view.  WRESTLING ERNEST
HEMINGWAY is more entertaining--THE CEMETERY CLUB never quite
clicked--but those who have seen both films will recognize the
similarities.</P>
<P>     Warner Brothers is having a hard time promoting WRESTLING ERNEST
HEMINGWAY, and the likely result will be a poor showing at the box
office.  They have an understandable problem, since the movie doesn't
offer a whole lot of quick clips to attract viewers.  It's a shame,
really, because while this movie has its fair share of flaws, there is
an audience for it.  The problem is that they probably won't know that
it exists.</P>
