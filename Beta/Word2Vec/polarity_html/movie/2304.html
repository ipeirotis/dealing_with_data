<P>     THE PELICAN BRIEF has a lot in common with this summer's THE
FIRM.  Of course, both are based on uberbestsellers by John Grisham,
but the similarities run deeper than that.  THE FIRM starred
Hollywood's most marketable male star, Tom Cruise; THE PELICAN BRIEF
grabbed the most marketable female star, Julia Roberts.  Both were
directed by "prestige" directors, and both were constructed from the
"slicker is better" model of thriller-making.  In short, THE PELICAN
BRIEF might as well *be* THE FIRM:  an overlong, over-plotted,
instantly forgettable entertainment sporadically enlivened by decent
supporting performances.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have Gene Hackman.</P>
<P>     THE PELICAN BRIEF opens with the assassination of two Supreme
Court justices who appear to have little in common, one an aging
liberal and the other a young conservative.  However, a possible link
is discovered by Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts), a law student at Tulane
University.  Through her law professor/lover Thomas Callahan (Sam
Shepard), Darby's theory, which comes to be known as "The Pelican
Brief," is circulated in Washington.  Among its implications are
possible connections between the assassinations and the president
(Robert Culp), and suddenly people start turning up dead.  A frightened
Darby turns to Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington), a White House
reporter investigating the assassinations, and soon the two are running
for their lives, desperately searching for proof of their theory before
they too are added to the growing body count.</P>
<P>     Technically, THE PELICAN BRIEF is just fine.  Director Alan J.
Pakula (ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, PRESUMED INNOCENT) knows how to
ratchet up the tension, using pull-back crane shots to heighten the
sense of paranoia.  James Horner's score works well, even if it does
depend overmuch on dissonant piano chords and wood block percussion.
The problem with THE PELICAN BRIEF, the movie, is the same thing that's
wrong with THE PELICAN BRIEF, the book:  there's not a single
interesting or original thing happening, either from a story or
character perspective.  The big conspiracy at the heart of the story is
both insipid and insulting to one's intelligence.  It's impossible to
accept that no one considered the possibility of spacing out the
assassinations, or being slightly more creative than putting a bullet
in the head of a man who was on a respirator.  There's only one
possible reason for such stupidity:  there wouldn't have been anything
for a clever law student to sniff out.  It's equally ludicrous to
suggest that no one else in Federal law enforcement would have
considered the possibilities Darby Shaw comes up with.  Grisham's story
is loaded with implausibilities and the payoff it offers for accepting
them is simply not worth it.</P>
<P>     The characters in Pakula's adaptation don't fare much better.
Julia Roberts chose Darby Shaw as her first role in two years, but it's
difficult to figure out why.  There is not a shred of back story,
nothing to suggest why she pursues the assassination story, nothing to
make her anything but a positively bland lady in distress.  To her
credit, Roberts' reaction to an explosion is gripping, and she's
thoroughly convincing at suggesting dazed trauma, but dazed and
traumatized is about as fara as this role goes.  Denzel Washington, one
of the most talented and charismatic leading men around, has an equally
blank slate with Gray Grantham; somehow he manages to act circles
around a part where there's really nothing there.  Up and down the cast
it's the same story:  Tony Goldwyn is the President's shadowy Chief of
Staff; John Lithgow is Washington's skeptical editor; Stanley Tucci is
the icy killer.  Only Hume Cronyn, in a single scene as the aging
justice Rosenberg, has any spark.  No one else has a thing to work
with.</P>
<P>     THE FIRM was no piece of art, but at least its characters were
reasonably fleshed out for the screen.  THE PELICAN BRIEF asked me to
sit through nearly two and a half hours of repetitive chases involving
people I didn't care about.  A third Grisham adaptation, THE CLIENT, is
on its way next year.  I suppose it's too much to ask that he's learned
to write an interesting story by now.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 pelicans:  4.</PRE>
