<PRE>                            BATMAN AND ROBIN
                       A film review by Hanson Yoo
                        Copyright 1997 Hanson Yoo</PRE>
<P>This is the worst movie I've seen since the "so bad I walked out on it"
"Jingle All The Way".  It is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an
oven fueled by crap.  It is crap through and through.</P>
<P>Nothing works in this film, as to be expected from Joel Schumacher, who
has made only one watchable film in his entire career (that being
"Cousins").  Here's a man who admits he's a medicore director, a rather
charmingly self-effacing statement.  But truth be told, he is much
worse than mediocre.</P>
<P>Not all scorn should be heaped on Schumacher though -- Akiva Goldsman
should not be allowed to write ever again.  There is no plot anywhere,
and the "dialogue" is unrelentingly shallow, preposterous, and boring.
They set up Mr. Freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his
cryogenically frozen wife, then completely sabotage his character by
giving him the lamest one-liners.  It turns him into a stock maniacal
villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding
scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the
brink of death.  But that's par for course -- nothing in this film
makes any sense, including half of Arnold Schwarzenegger's lines.  As
Mr. Freeze, Arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once.
This is the same problem he had in "Jingle All the Way", and it seems
that his Austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as
the days pass.  Personally, I think that he has more pull with the
directors and doesn't retake scenes to make him understandable.
Compare his dialogue in the Terminator series to the load of nonsense
that streams forth in "Batman & Robin".  Apparently, James Cameron
knows how to get a competent performance out of Arnold.</P>
<P>Uma Thurman is not as bad, but nothing resembling good either.  Her
Poison Ivy vamps around terribly, chewing up scenery left and right.
And her Pamela Isley scenes are marred by sub-SNL standard "acting", as
if she's reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given
moment.  Given the "script", it's a wonder it didn't happen more
frequently.</P>
<P>There is no redeeming feature in this film -- not George Clooney as
Batman, Chris O'Donnell as Robin, nor Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl.
Michael Gough is eerily sickly looking as Alfred, as if the conceit of
his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance.  In fact, there
was something unsettling about his appearance, which seems to have been
accomplished without any make-up tricks, looking as if it were scenes
from a documentary about a dying man.  Unfortunately, every scene about
Alfred's sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is
absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions,
losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart.</P>
<P>The movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never
give any sense of a big battle -- you know there's a bunch of people,
but instead of a melee, Schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a
fist.  There's never a moment of awe, wonder, or mayhem.  The only
interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects, which
are impressive (and probably expensive).  Even then, the fights are so
full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable.  The hockey
team from hell?  Not even the TV series got that stupid (at least not
on the grand scale of stupidity that "Batman & Robin" showcases).</P>
<P>Frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and
off with nothing to say or do.  Blink, and you'll miss Elle MacPherson
as Julie Madison, Vivica Fox as a "why is she even in the film" vamp in
Freeze's lair (with all of two lines), and Pat Hingle as the most
ineffectual Commissioner Gordan the Batman series ever had.  And in
what almost seems like an effort to save on costs, Vendela Kirsebom has
no lines as Mrs. Fries -- she isn't even filmed well enough to look
good (trust me, she's quite attractive outside of this dreck).</P>
<P>And as if the film weren't bad enough to limp along with bad direction,
bad dialogue, bad performances, and bad fight scenes, there are
inconsistencies and illogic galore.  I know it's nit-picky to ask where
the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs, why the
character's arms aren't ripped out of their sockets when they
accomplish a one-armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet
(while holding on to another person no less), or where the moisture
comes from when Freeze's weapon creates tons if ice.  That's all
traditional comic book stuff.  But why does Batman spring a trap for
Freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of
by-standers? Why is there a big switch clearly marked, "Heat" in Mr.
Freeze's lair?  Why do countless bumbling police officers even try to
take on Mr. Freeze hand to hand?  Why does Alfred encourage Silverstone
to become Batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her?
Why do Batman & Robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the
Batcave in response to an emergency?  And since it established early on
that Ivy is using pheromones, why don't they wear masks to filter it
out?  I could go on and on.</P>
<P>"Batman & Robin" is a braindead, pointless, garish, loud film that
should still reign as the "worst film of the year" by the time 1998
rolls along.  Note to Warner Bros. -- if you're going to make another
Batman film, please replace Schumacher with nearly anyone.  Because it
could actually get worse than this.  What Schumacher does not
understand is that "comic book" doesn't automatically equal unbearable
idiocy.  The true equation seems to be Schumacher + Batman = unbearable
idiocy.</P>
