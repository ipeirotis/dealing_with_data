<PRE>SPAWN (1997)
A "Turkey of the Week" film review by Justin Felix.  
Copyright 1998 Justin Felix.  </PRE>
<PRE>Rating: ** (out of five)</PRE>
<P>Screen Story by Alan McElroy and Mark A. Z. Dippe.  
Screenplay by Alan McElroy.  
Based on the comic book by Todd McFarlane.  
Directed by Mark A. Z. Dippe.  
Starring Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Martin Sheen.  
Rated PG-13 (contains violence and profanity)  93 mins.</P>
<P>Synopsis:  Al Simmons, top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience, dies in
a fiery explosion and goes to hell.  Making a pact with Malebolgia, a chief
demon there, Simmons returns to Earth 5 years later reborn as Spawn, a
general in Hell's army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives,
chains, and a morphing cape.  Sullen, wise Cogliostro and flatulating,
wisecracking Violator vy for Spawn's attention.  </P>
<P>Comments:  When Todd McFarlane left Marvel Comics (where he had made a name
for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the "Spider-Man"
titles) to join the newly-formed, creator-owned Image Comics, a new comic
book legend was born: Spawn.  McFarlane's "Spawn" immediately became a
commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the
1990s.  McFarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually
intricate, allowing McFarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to
the max.  The early "Spawn" issues brilliantly capture McFarlane's genius
at illustration and show his early attempts at writing.</P>
<P>With the popularity of "Spawn" and the success of the current Warner
Bros.'s BATMAN film franchise, a movie version of some sort seemed
inevitable for Spawn.  In the summer of 1997, hence, New Line Cinema
released SPAWN, a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series.
This topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately
topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book, like me, numbed by how
much SPAWN misses the mark.</P>
<P>What happened?  Why is SPAWN so bad?  Todd McFarlane himself executive
produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo.  I don't
think, however, that his presence necessarily hurt (or helped) the film.  I
place the blame, in part, on the recent Hollywood trend, fueled by public
demand apparently, for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest
computer technology.  These films focus upon the effects at the expense of
everything else: character, plot, dialogue, etc.  SPAWN, reflecting this
trend, shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with
morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics.  Hardly a
minute goes by in this film without fires, explosions, knives and chains
appearing out of nowhere, glowing eyes, or constantly transforming demons.
A lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid, don't get me
wrong, but, because the script and cast aren't engaging, SPAWN ultimately
comes across like overwrought wallpaper (the surface may capture the eye,
but nothing exists underneath).  </P>
<P>SPAWN's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline
level.  McFarlane's Spawn was a tortured hero.  A mercenary by trade, Al
Simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful Wanda.
Having died and journeyed to Hell, he made a pact to return to Earth to be
with Wanda.  Simmons, however, discovers that his memories are fragmented,
his body a creepy mess, and his wife married.  Despite his sometimes
violent nature, readers couldn't help but feel sympathetic toward his
plight as the spawn of the underworld.  SPAWN attempts to show all of this
but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so.  When the characters
are developed, they seem absurd rather than touching.  The cartoonish
dialogue and implausible subplot (a general possesses the antidote to a
supervirus called Heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world)
do not help matters.  </P>
<P>SPAWN, in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of BATMAN, also
unwisely spends too much time on a villain, the Violator (BATMAN favored
the Joker over Batman).  John Leguizamo, like Jack Nicholson in BATMAN,
receives top billing in the cast as the Violator; Michael Jai White (Al
Simmons / Spawn) is second.  I ordinarily find Leguizamo an intensely
annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for
the Violator.  The film, however, spends so much time on the Violator's
offensive antics that they grate on the nerves.  Apparently meant to be the
comic relief in the film (as Nicholson was in BATMAN), especially when
contrasted with the sullen Spawn, the Violator's lines are oftentimes
grotesque and unfunny, leaving the audience wishing he would leave.
Leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role, but he is seen far too often
in the film.  Michael Jai White, a relative newcomer to theatrical
releases, seems to be an appealing actor, and he handles his role
adequately, but we see little of him without various masks on.  More time
needed to be spent on White's character before he became Spawn for the
movie to pull at the heartstrings.</P>
<P>A special note should be made about Martin Sheen as the over-the-top,
obnoxious, evil General Wynn.  Easily the hammiest performance in the
movie, it's hard to imagine how Sheen mucked up his role so much; after
all, he played a Vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great APOCALYPSE NOW.
Sheen's excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a
mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career
in film.  </P>
<P>Many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant
special effects to drag SPAWN down.  MTV-style, jerky, in-your-face editing
is one of them.  Flames, for example, roll across the screen sometimes to
announce a shift in setting.  Cogliostro, unlikely wannabe guide for Spawn,
serves as a poor narrator for the film.  He goofily tells the audience, at
one point, that "how much of [Spawn's] humanity is left remains to be
seen," as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to
another.  The music, finally, assaults the audience as much as the manic
violence and offensive dialogue.  Loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with
drum loops dominate some scenes.  To be fair, however, Marilyn Manson's
"Long Hard Road Out of Hell" effectively compliments Spawn's return to
Earth, while Filter and the Crystal Method's "(Can't You) Trip Like I Do"
proves a surprisingly fitting theme song.</P>
<P>For as good a comic book as it is, "Spawn" did not spawn a good movie.
SPAWN, instead, suffers from too much pomp and circumstance, and too little
plot and character development.  It receives two stars for its technically
well-done special effects.  Many other films, though, have equal, if not
superior, special effects and are much better.  Rated PG-13, SPAWN seems
more violent than many R-rated movies and probably wouldn't be appropriate
for the very young.</P>
