<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An historical fantasy film that took eight years to make. Kevin Brownlow
started it in 1956 when he was 18 and was helped by the 16-year-old
co-director Mollo; they finished it 1964, but had to wait two more years
before United Artists could distribute it. This low-budget independent
effort (it had a whopping budget of about $20,000), initiated from an
original idea by Kevin Brownlow.The events are make believe; the B/W
film resembles an Orwellian nightmare. It is an intensive study of what
it might have been like in England in 1944 if it had lost the war and
had been occupied by the Germans. The directors are serious students of
the past and their aim is re-create that vision. It is the same aim that
they had for their other film, Winstanley (75).</P>
<P>Kubrick furnished Brownlow with some of his leftover film stock from Dr.
Strangelove to finish shooting it; another established director, Tony
Richardson, also helped the filmmakers out.</P>
<P>The German invasion of England took place in July 1940 after the British
retreat from Dunkirk. The British resisted at first, but the German army
beat down that resistance. The resistance movement lacking outside
support, was finally crushed. Then, in 1944, the resistance movement
reappeared. This is where this fantasy film begins. It looks as if it is
a semidocumentary, with scenes padded for dramatic effect and narrative.</P>
<P>Pauline Murray (in real-life, she is a doctor's wife) is the main
character; she is an apolitical Irish-born district nurse working in the
area of Salisbury, who gets caught up in the horrors of the conflict.
The partisan movement uses terror to get the Germans out of the rural
towns they have captured. This forces the Germans to evacuate all the
civilians in those towns. She witnesses six of her closest friends
gunned down by the partisans, and decides to make her way from the
country to the demilitarized zone of London. Fearing she can't work as a
nurse unless she joins a British fascist organization, also fed up with
the violence on both sides, she thereby naively joins the Immediate
Action Organization (IA)-  and is trained to work in their fascist style
and methods. She is most proud of the new shoes they give her, which is
probably one of the appeals the Nazis had to the people when starting
out in impoverished Germany. To answer her concerns that the IA looks
just like the Nazis, the leader tells her, we must organize ourselves
like the Nazis to succeed. We must be even better organized then they
are. When the war is over, then we will see what happens.</P>
<P>She will gradually see through their deceits, remaining loyal to her
friends who harbor partisans rather than being loyal to the IA. She
hears the IA diatribes against the Jews and the call for euthanasia to
rid the country of the undesirables, but she only wants for things to be
normal again in England. The power in the film is from the sheer force
of the clash of ideas and the expressions coming forth from the
nonprofessional actors. The film allows you the luxury to see things for
yourself instead of being spoon-fed what to believe.</P>
<P>Who better to play a fascist, than a real live one- Colin Jordan! He
presents his case for hatred in his own words, which at the time,
frightened many people, including certain British Jewish organizations
who feared his message would be taken literally. The result was that
seven minutes of the film were cut until recently, when Brownlow
regained control of the film and Milestone released it for the first
time in its full version. It was the directors intention that by having
the neo-Nazi leader speak his mind, he would reveal how ridiculous his
ideas were, which proved to be true.</P>
<P>One of the more interesting scenes, was that of the patients suffering
from tuberculosis being transported to a comfortable hospital. They were
played by real TB patients and were moved into a real TB rehabilitation
center. This scene of euthanasia was done in a most humane manner, by
injecting them with poison, it was one of the most powerful and stunning
scenes to behold.</P>
<P>The filmmakers used mainly original rather than merely authentic
costumes and props, and they refrained from using any archival footage,
which would have been easy to obtain. They drew most of their sense of
history from the 1940s by watching newsreels, but in the film they only
used voice-overs from professionals who donated their services and used
montages and close-ups to get the 1944 look they wanted. You can say
whatever you want about their methods, but when you look at the results
you feel the intensity and madness of the drama, it has a curious
starkness about it that is very compelling. It had the mark of a true
artist's stamp on it, even its amateur production values do not weigh
heavily against it. Even the ending of the film, as it comes to no
particular conclusion, it just ends by allowing this remarkable work to
be viewed for what it suggested, shows a confidence that the film
accomplished what it set out to do. It certainly took the smugness out
of anyone thinking that fascism couldn't surface in a country like
England. Everyone in the film was compromised to a certain extent,
including the decent Pauline Murray, who fell for the phony appeal of
the Nazis, thinking they could bring law and order to a country reeling
from riotous conditions. It showed the final liberation by the
Americans, as an ironically gruesome scene, where collaborators were
rounded up and executed. Earlier on, it showed the Germans killing off
the villagers and quietly smiling as they went about their business. A
call for pacifism, is the clearest message that could be heard from
between the lines when all is said and done.</P>
