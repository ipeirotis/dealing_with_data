<P>In December of 1996, a little movie called "Scream," was released, 
became a box-office smash, and resurrected films targeted at teens. 
First, it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad (both "Scream" 
movies, "I Know What You Did Last Summer," "Urban Legend," etc.), but 
just recently, the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre 
(a 'la '80s John Hughes), starting with last June's "Can't Hardly Wait." 
It may be the first week of April in 1999, but so far this year we have 
been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single 
week: "Varsity Blues," "Jawbreaker," "Cruel Intentions," "Simply 
Irresistible," "The Rage: Carrie 2," and "The Mod Squad." Coming April 9 
are two more of this type: "Never Been Kissed" and "Go," and on April 
23, we've got the teen satire "Election" and the teen horror-comedy 
"Idle Hands." Jeesh! Out of all of these moves, however, the one that is 
most similar to the latest incarnation, "10 Things I Hate About You," is 
this past January's mediocre, ho-hum "She's All That." Although similar 
in plotting (ok, darn near identical), "10 Things I Hate About You," a 
modern-day version of Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew" ("She's 
All That" got its inspiration from "Pygmalion"), is an infinitely 
superior film in every department, from the smart direction by 
first-time feature director Gil Junger to the charming and well-written 
screenplay by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith to the striking 
ensemble cast, who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy 
since 1985's "The Breakfast Club." And to top it all off, in the 
inevitable climax set at the prom, at least we didn't have to once again 
suffer through a goofy, inappropriate dance sequence (who could forget, 
or want to remember, for that matter, this ludicrous development in 
"She's All That?").</P>
<P>The day wide-eyed, shy new student Cameron James (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) 
starts school at Seattle-based Padua High, he is swept away at the sight 
of the beautiful and popular sophomore, Bianca Stratford (Larisa 
Oleynik). Although he doesn't know french, he purposefully learns some 
of it just so he can tutor her, but finds that her paranoid gynecologist 
father (Larry Miller) won't allow her to date until her bitter, 
unconventional older sister, Kat (Julia Stiles), a senior, decides to. 
Kat, of course, has sworn off the likes of boys, but Cameron sets out to 
find someone that will be the perfect match for her, which is exactly 
what he finds in the form of the rebellious Patrick Verona (Heath 
Ledger). Complicating matters, Cameron's dorky friend, Michael (David 
Krumholtz), decides to use a wealthy jock, Joey (Andrew Keegan), who 
also has his sights set on Bianca, as a pawn so that he will pay Patrick 
to get Kat to go out with him, and then Cameron hopes to steal Bianca 
away from Joey.</P>
<P>As you can see, "10 Things I Hate About You" includes a huge number of 
characters, some of which I haven't even mentioned, such as Kat's 
Shakespeare-obsessed friend, Mandella (Susan May Pratt) and Bianca's 
materialistic comrade, Chastity (Gabrielle Union). At a short, but 
well-used running time of 98 minutes, all of the characters are 
perfectly handled, satisfyingly developed, and, for the most part, are 
not treated as caricatures (another flaw of "She's All That," where the 
bad guys (and gals) ran around constantly saying, "you're vapor"). Since 
I could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central 
characters, and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were 
surprisingly effective, I got completely caught up in all of the 
relationships and was thoroughly entertained.</P>
<P>Aside from a good screenplay, it's the performances that can make or 
break a movie, and director Junger has really hit the jackpot. Aside 
from Joseph Gordon-Levitt ("3rd Rock from the Sun"), who gives his 
strongest performance to date here, none of the actors are that 
well-known, but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to 
the proceedings. As the main character of Kat, Julia Stiles (last seen 
in the miniseries "The '60s") is marvelous and always believable, and 
certainly has a bright future ahead of her. Even though it is her role 
that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged, it was easy to 
identify with Kat's way of thinking (she is against the silly tradition 
of the prom and loves reading Sylvia Plath), and I completely admired 
her individuality. No one, I think, could have portrayed her as 
perfectly as Stiles does. Heath Ledger, as the infamous bad-boy of the 
town, injects much life into Patrick, and has a lot of chemistry with 
Stiles. One other actor of note is Larisa Oleynik who, with the help of 
screenwriters Lutz and Smith, is able to turn Bianca into a person with 
multi-dimensions, even though she is accurately self-centered at the 
on-set. In one truthful scene, Cameron angrily asks her if she has 
always been so selfish, and Bianca grudgingly realizes that yes, she 
has. </P>
<P>One off-beat element of the film, and a source of some hearty laughs, is 
the way that the school's staff act, which is strikingly unformal. 
Allison Janney, as the guidance counselor Ms. Perky, who is writing a 
trashy Harlequin romance novel, is comic dynamite, as is Daryl "Chill" 
Mitchell as the english teacher, who reads Shakespeare to the class in 
rap and, at one point, sends Kat to the office because, for once, she 
actually thinks one of his assignments is really good. Although there 
are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning, 
most of it actually works, especially in the humorous and witty dialogue 
exchanges and quirks between the characters. In one very funny scene, 
Chastity asks, "I know people can be overwhelmed, and they can be 
underwhelmed, but can people just be...whelmed?" At another point, 
Bianca and Kat's father (a stand-out Larry Miller), who is constantly 
terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant, only allows 
Bianca to go to the prom on one occasion: before she leaves, she has to 
put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it's 
like to be pregnant.</P>
<P>"10 Things I Hate About You" once and for all proves that there is still 
life in the teen comedy genre, and this movie is probably more 
reminiscent of the great John Hughes than any other film of the '90s. It 
also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack, mixing 
indie-rock with new wave '80s songs (and with, thank goodness, no rap). 
By the film's end, it actually had me rooting for certain characters to 
get together, and I was also quite pleased with how everything was 
wrapped up, especially in the final scenes involving Kat and Bianca, Kat 
and her father, and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which Kat 
gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class (this is 
where the title comes from). Luckily, I doubt I would be able to find 
ten things I hate about "10 Things I Hate About You," but the positive 
aspects of the film far out-number ten. </P>
