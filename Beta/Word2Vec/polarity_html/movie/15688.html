Dustin Putman's Film Reviews</A> ></P>
<P>So much for sweet returns. After smart horror films were starting to be 
made again after the exploitative 80's slasher movies, starting with 
1996's "Scream," and followed by "Scream 2," "Urban Legend," and the 
original, "I Know What You Did Last Summer," a film like, "I Still Know 
What You Did Last Summer," was bound to be made sooner or late. It is a 
perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned 
out, and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator 
in filmmaking, favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense, and 
trading in fleshed out, likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits. </P>
<P>It has been exactly one year since Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) 
suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by Ben Willis, a 
psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the 
middle of the road, and then, thinking he was dead, dumped him into the 
ocean. Since then, Julie has relocated to Boston University, and 
although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams, she has been able to 
put her life back together. When Julie's friend, Karla (Brandy), is 
called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of 
Brazil is, she wins a vacation to the Bahamas for four people, which 
also includes Karla's horny boyfriend, Tyrell (Mekhi Phifer), and Will 
(Matthew Settle), who Karla sets Julie up with after her own boyfriend, 
Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr., also returning from the original), doesn't show 
up. When they reach the secluded island, they discover it is the last 
day of the open season, and will be stranded there for the 4th of July 
weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for 
them. Of course, Julie, her friends, and the workers aren't the only 
ones there, as the murderous Ben Willis, dressed in fisherman garb, 
returns to seek revenge on Julie once and for all.</P>
<P>It is a sad state of affairs when a movie like, "I Still Know What You 
Did Last Summer," is made. I am a very big fan of horror movies, and so 
it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to 
"IKWYDLS," which I am a fan of, is almost an exact replica of a "Friday 
the 13th" movie. While the original focused more on the story and 
characters, as well as genuinely suspenseful moments, thanks to the 
screenplay by Kevin Williamson (who didn't return to write the sequel, 
and it shows), "I Still Know..." has no story to speak of, and is so 
vacuous of ideas, that the filmmakers, were forced to have a murder 
occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested. Also gone 
are any signs of character development, and since every single character 
died before I got to know them, all I was left with was to stare at the 
screen, indifferent to what was going on. While I cared about the fates 
of the characters in the original, it made no difference to me in this 
sequel who lived and died. They were all paper-thin and pointless, 
except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman.</P>
<P>Another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly 
crafted set-pieces, like the store sequence with Sarah Michelle Gellar, 
but there are none to speak of in this sequel (although they do come 
close at one moment with Brandy). Since so many people were killed every 
couple minutes, the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in 
water. Also of note is the mystery of the second killer, and accomplice 
to Ben, but it is obvious from the first frame who it is, and so I 
couldn't even have fun at that, like I did in the "Scream" movies and, 
"Urban Legend."</P>
<P>It figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some 
recognition again, a film would come along and ruin it for everyone 
else. Maybe the people who made, "I Still Know What You Did Last 
Summer," should have realized that in order to make a good movie, you 
must have a screenplay---or at least one that isn't such a black hole 
for thoughts and ideas. The ending of the film inevitably leaves the 
door wide open for a third part, but judging from this amazingly 
lackluster first sequel, everyone involved should have quit while they 
were still ahead. </P>
