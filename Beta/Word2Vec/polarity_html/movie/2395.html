<PRE>                              ROMEO IS BLEEDING
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Juliette Lewis, Annabella
Sciorra, Roy Scheider.
Screenplay:  Hilary Henkin.
Director:  Peter Medak.</PRE>
<P>     Sometimes you can learn a lot about a film from its ad campaign.
The television spots for ROMEO IS BLEEDING featured a high energy,
rapid-edit montage which made the film look like an all-out action
thriller; the print ads, on the other hand, featured stylized
renderings of the stars in a scene out of a 50's crime comic, with
critical blurbs in word balloons.  And that about sums up what's wrong
with ROMEO IS BLEEDING.  There's a fair amount of style and
black-humored mayhem, but underneath it is a film that really doesn't
seem to know whether it wants to be a noir thriller or a parody of a
noir thriller, and a script that is an absolute mess.</P>
<P>     Gary Oldman stars as Sgt. Jack Grimaldi, a New York cop with a
wife (Annabella Sciorra), a mistress (Juliette Lewis) and ethics that
are always for rent.  Although primarily assigned to watch over
organized crime figures preparing to testify against their bosses, his
big money comes from one of those bosses, a kingpin named Falcone (Roy
Scheider) who pays Jack to reveal where the stool pigeons are
roosting.  Falcone's latest target is Mona Demarkov (Lena Olin), a
psychotic "hit person."  Mona offers Jack $350,000 *not* to reveal her
whereabouts, and to help her stage her death.  Jack soon realizes he
can't have it both ways, as Falcone and Mona begin closing in from
opposite sides.</P>
<P>     Stylistically, ROMEO IS BLEEDING seems to be on the right track.
Director Peter Medak has two great films about British crime figures to
his credit (THE KRAYS and LET HIM HAVE IT), and shows he's studied his
American gangster classics.  The lighting is evocative, the air is
usually thick with cigarette smoke, and trumpets and saxophones wail
plaintively in the background.  A running voice-over narrative by Jack,
told in retrospect and in the third person, achieves the right Raymond
Chandler-esque tone of impending doom.  The stage is set to have some
fun with film noir conventions--the dumb blonde girlfriend, the
urbane mob boss--but that's not what happens.</P>
<P>     What does happen is that Medak and screenwriter Hilary Henkin
decide to serve up a freaked-out combination of 1940s and 1990s crime
film sensibilities, sort of a "what if Quentin Tarantino and Abel
Ferrara collaborated on a Phillip Marlowe adaptation." Consequently,
the tone of ROMEO IS BLEEDING is radically uneven, with moody
conversations slamming into blood-spattered confrontations, and
characterizations which don't make a shred of sense.  The most glaring
and gruesome example of this confusion is Lena Olin's Mona, who is part
femme fatale and part Terminator.  There is no consistency to her
actions, as she goes to a macabre extreme to make her feigned death
appear real, then kidnaps the man she was supposedly trying to fool,
has his henchmen work for her, and then turns herself in to the
police.  The only logic in ROMEO IS BLEEDING is the logic of excess, as
the filmmakers abandon all pretense of telling a story in the name of
the outrageous.</P>
<P>     Structurally, the script for ROMEO IS BLEEDING is a disaster.  One
of the key points to the story is that Jack sends his wife away for
safety, so that he can meet up with her later.  This conversion comes
out of nowhere; to that point we had only seen a vague tolerance
between them (in a single scene), and nothing to indicate that Jack
sincerely loved her.  Jack is developed in a careless, haphazzard
manner that left me without any concern for what happened to him.
Finally, ROMEO IS BLEEDING commits perhaps its most unpardonable sin
with a final showdown between Jack and Mona which was so anti-climactic
that I groaned out loud.  At times, the film seems to have been
improvised, as though in the middle of shooting someone would
periodically say, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool to do this?"  ROMEO IS
BLEEDING looks good, occasionally very good, and Olin's performance is
entertaining, but the film also appears to have been edited with a
knife and fork, and amounts to little more than a series of loosely
connected scenes with shock value.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 romeos:  4.</PRE>
