<P>     NENETTE AND BONI is Claire Denis' followup to her 1994 made-for-
French-TV film, U.S. GO HOME.  While Denis employed an unusually
straightforward approach to that movie (necessitated by the demands of a
short, 60-minute running length), here she has returned to her more
familiar, elliptical style.  This method of film making allows the
characters to develop slowly while affording the viewer an opportunity
to think about what's going on.  And a chance to reflect is needed,
because Denis eschews standard narrative techniques, leaving all sorts
of unresolved issues and unanswered questions.</P>
<P>     Despite being siblings, Nenette (Alice Houri) and Boni (Gregoire
Colin) are not close.  The son of divorced parents, Boni sided with his
late mother while his sister lived with their father.  But, when teenage
Nenette discovers that she's pregnant and runs away from home, she has
no one to turn to but her brother.  Reluctantly, Boni agrees to let
Nenette stay with him, but, as the days pass, her presence alters from
being an unwanted intrusion to an integral part of his life.  More
importantly, while Nenette is seemingly indifferent to her unborn child
(she would have an abortion if it wasn't too late in the pregnancy), the
upcoming birth means everything to Boni.</P>
<P>     The story told by NENETTE AND BONI is simple; the relationships are
not.  The film is about two characters -- a brother and sister -- who
complete each other.  Each has something that the other lacks, and, as
the film progresses, they grow inexorably closer, finding a sort of
spiritual common ground.  Outwardly, they are often cool and distant to
each other, fearful of where the relationship might lead if given free
reign.  And, while there is no overt sexual contact between them, their
emotional bond transports them to a level of intimacy beyond incest.</P>
<P>     In addition to dealing with the brother/sister association, Denis
explores the rifts that can develop in families.  Boni's hatred for his
father (Jacques Nolot) is raw and unchecked.  We don't know exactly what
happened to split the family -- that's not important to Denis -- but we
observe the ruined aftermath, and, in understanding what Boni has lost
in the breakup, we see why he is so determined to offer a better
alternative to Nenette's child, and how that baby fulfills a need in his
life.</P>
<P>     Three members of NENETTE AND BONI's cast are returning from U.S. GO
HOME.  Gregoire Colin and Alice Houri are again playing brother and
sister, and their chemistry here is as effective as it was in the
earlier movie.  Both are naturally charismatic performers and clearly
understand what motivates their characters.  Vincent Gallo, who was a
soldier in U.S. GO HOME, is an American baker living in Marseilles. 
Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi portrays the baker's wife, who also happens to be
the object of Boni's erotic fantasies.</P>
<P>     This is Denis' most sensual motion picture.  Without ever showing
more than a flash of exposed skin, she manages to convey heavy
eroticism.  Take for example, the scene where Boni kneads the dough as
he might a woman's breasts -- playing with it, caressing it, and kissing
it.  It's a stirring and evocative scene, and no one in the audience
will be oblivious to what it symbolizes.  NENETTE AND BONI is replete
with moments like this.  The real core of the film, however, lies in the
complex tangle of emotions that lurk just beneath the polished surface. 
Some viewers may feel cheated by the film's apparent incompleteness,
but, as dissatisfying as the conclusion may seem, such loose ends are
worth putting up with for the privilege of experiencing what comes
beforehand.</P>
