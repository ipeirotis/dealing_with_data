<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Winstanley is a truly amazing and painstaking account of misery, as it
depicts those whose cause is righteous and nonviolent. Winstanley evokes
the civil war mood of the mid-1600s - where Cromwell's parliamentary
forces defeat and behead the king and only there is a second bloody
civil war where the levellers, those who wanted a share in the land, are
crushed by Cromwell, thereby ending a shortlived optimism abounding that
things for the poor will change for the better. The narrative is taken
from the pamphlet writings of Gerrard Winstanley, a gentle, Christian
radical. He sort of resembles a hippie of the 1970s. The film is based
on the book by David Caute, "Comrade Jacob," but has been thoroughly
reworked by co-directors Brownlow and Mollo.</P>
<P>In April 1649, at St. George's Hill in Surrey, England, a
Reformation-era religious sect of about 40 called the Diggers form a
commune and till the soil on "common land," which by law permits grazing
- but not settlement and cultivation. Gerrard Winstanley (Miles
Halliwell), the leader of the Diggers, wanted to reclaim the land for
the poor who had been dispossessed by Oliver Cromwell's recent civil
war. Unfortunately, the local landowners saw the Diggers as a threat to
their livelihood and way of life and, led by the stern Presbyterian
parson, John Platt (Bramley), use local thugs and government troops to
violently uproot the Digger commune.</P>
<P>Brownlow is by no means a great filmmaker, he is more known for his
books: "The Parade's Gone By"/"Behind the Mask of Innocence," and for
his English TV series on the silent-era: Hollywood, Unknown Chaplin,
Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow, Harold Lloyd: The Third Genius. His
unique filming style, his penchant for austerity, his demand for
authenticity, his equalizing of all scenes in importance so that no
event sticks out from the others, and his inspired devotion toward
looking at the past, perhaps hoping to unearth some missing piece in the
puzzle of mankind that keeps the modern world from advancing on the past
tragedies, gives this film an air of adventure. Lacking the necessary
dramatics of films that are more accessible to the general public, this
film is nonetheless a work of great intrigue and visual beauty. Despite
being filmed without the benefit of professional actors, the only
professional being Jerome Willis who played General Fairfax, this film
has a certain solemnity about it that forces its truths to be seen in
the face of the actors. It is Brownlow's way of filming such misery, a
way that records the Diggers' sufferings as if it were the official
record of what happened, and probably could pass for what is official.
This sense of reality is what gives the film its raw power. It's a
lesson in history that is re-created from the words of a journal that
allows the directors to look back at the past with a sense of reverence.</P>
<P>This film acts as a vehicle to understand what the Diggers believed and
how they lived, and how they justly thought that the earth was made
common property for everyone. That everyone born on earth shall be fed
by it and that all are equals in the Creation. So when Winstanley says,
"Our life is a hard one," we can see for ourselves what he meant. In
real life the actor who played Winstanley, Miles Halliwell, was a
teacher. He read Caute's book and recommended it to Brownlow, thereby
securing the part. His performance was beautiful.</P>
<P>Most of the nonprofessionals actors were locals hired because of their
17th century look. Sid Rawle plays a Ranter, they upset the Diggers with
their contempt for the Bible and made them feel uncomfortable when they
entered their commune. He is from the New Diggers, a modern day commune
that is interested in squatter's rights. Andrew Mollo, a military
historian, was asked to help with the costumes and then collaborated on
the script and direction. His father donated the land where the filming
took place.</P>
<P>The Diggers no longer exist, having evolved into the modern day Quakers.</P>
<P>There is no question, this low budget project, the BFI put up seventeen
thousand pounds, achieved the maximum in having an authentic look, even
showing the rare breeds of animals, of the time. It showed breeds of
pigs and chickens that don't exist today but did during the 17th
century. The film took 8 years to finish, but the actual shooting was
done in 7 weeks. The cast had day jobs and therefore the filming had to
be done over an extended period of time. The film's cost is about the
same as a James Bond film's title scene would cost. The film's
cinematographer, Ernest Vincze, like almost everyone in the film,
including the directors, worked for nothing. He would often be gone to
take high paying jobs in another film before returning.</P>
<P>This little known event in English history, the first "communist" revolt
in history, was re-created in a straight-forward fashion, telling what
went wrong and why it failed by 1651. It doesn't pretend to have the
answers, but the questions it raises about the ability of mankind to
live and work together, is one worth asking.</P>
<P>The message of the film might seem naive or confrontational to many,
including the Marxists, the bourgeoisie, the film critics looking for a
more recognizable kind of film to evaluate, and the common man, bored by
what he doesn't want to know. But to others, perhaps the more restless
in society, not afraid of ideas, there is a freshness in this work that
you can't easily shrug off by pointing to the filmmaker's refusal to be
more melodramatic. The scenes were acted with conviction and its lack of
Hollywood type of poshness actually played to its favor, making the
action seem more pertinent.</P>
<P>The Diggers' song attests to the idealism they sought: "You poor take
courage, you rich take care, This Earth was made a Common Treasury for
everyone to share, All things in common, all people one."</P>
<PRE>                       Leon Rosselson "The Diggers' Song"</PRE>
<P>The Diggers worked the rough soil, they were amid a hostile surrounding,
unprotected and harassed by the followers of the law. Their story is not
something you can easily forget in the black-and- white framed shots,
taken by a hand-held camera, and in their uncompromising idealism
squaring off against self-righteous forces that wanted to crush them,
afraid of their new visions for mankind. Try comparing Winstanley to
other period films of the commercial variety, and it is hard not to see
how much more real and meaningful this film is. If nothing else, at
least, it is a hard film to forget. For the poetic dream of Winstanley,
for an equitable and more reasonable world, one that is not forged by
malice and greed: that is a vision the world is still waiting to see
actually happen.</P>
<P>This film is available on video by Milestone.</P>
