<P>     After 40 years and 19 films, the James Bond series is a cinematic
institution -- perhaps even the last cinematic institution. In a film
industry climate where the object of big-budget movies is generally to
show the audience something new and dazzling, the Bond series is all about
structural stability. You know you'll get a show-stopping stunt sequence
to kick things off. You know that stunt sequence will lead into opening
credits filled with writhing female silhouettes. You the opening credits
will lead into a visit with Q (Desmond Llewelyn). You know Bond will fire
off a few ghastly puns aimed at Q's latest gadgets. Going to a Bond film
is like going to a fast food restaurant. You attend because there's
something comforting about knowing it will taste the same every time. It's
a recipe you don't want to see shaken or stirred.</P>
<P>     In a sense, there's little to say about THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH that
hasn't already been said about the 18 installments that have preceded it.
It goes without saying that Agent 007 (Pierce Brosnan) has a mission that
involves a beautiful woman or two. One of them is Elektra King (Sophie
Marceau), an oil heiress whose pipeline -- and life -- appear to be in
danger; one of them is Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), a nuclear
weapons expert in a pin-up body. It similarly goes without saying that
there's a villain bent on mass destruction. His name is Renard (Robert
Carlyle), a terrorist-for-hire who has been rendered impervious to pain by
a bullet to the medulla oblongata. And it goes without saying that the
clock is ticking on a dastardly plan involving the very fate of the free
world (or at least Istanbul), and that only Bond can save us.</P>
<P>     It does bear mentioning that THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH turns out to be
a frustrating combination of the all-too-common and the distractingly
absent. The film does open with a rousing pre-credits chase sequence
involving motorboats racing down the Thames. When Bond leaps from a boat
sailing through the air, catching the dangling rope on a hot air balloon
in the process, there's hope that director Michael Apted can maintain that
sort of high-flying absurdity. Then the wearying deja vu begins to set
in. How many times can we thrill to Bond fleeing gunmen while skiing? How
many times can a shootout in a place where every inanimate object explodes
be interesting? How many times can you wring excitement from getting
caught underwater without air? To Apted's credit, he does find a slick new
twist when he threatens Bond with a helicopter armed with a massive
clearcutting saw. Far more often, the perfunctory thrice-hourly action
sequences are just there to remind you that you're watching a Bond film.</P>
<P>     Sometimes the reminder is necessary, because THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH 
is otherwise short on traditional Bond texture. The film may trot out
locations in Spain, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkey, but it never does
anything with them, denying us the welcome pleasure of Bond film as exotic
travelogue. Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards, scrumptious though they
may be, are a major come-down from the magnetism of TOMORROW NEVER DIES'
Michelle Yeoh. Most disappointing of all is Renard, who may be the least
commanding villain the series has ever seen. It's bad enough that he gets
only a few scenes to develop any kind of personality; it's inexcusable
that he turns out to be a self-pitying lap dog for the real villain
pulling the strings. Mix in the absence of a suitably unstoppable nasty
henchman (are the Oddjobs and Jaws's of the post-Cold War world so hard to
come by?), and you've got a pretty vanilla thrilla.</P>
<P>     It is enjoyable to watch Pierce Brosnan growing into the role of Bond
so comfortably. Connery enthusiasts may cringe, but I believe Brosnan is
the best all-around Bond yet -- no one else has combined such convincing
licensed-to-kill menace with a bon vivant twinkle in the eye. He's still a
presence worth watching, as are Dame Judi Dench (in a meatier-than-usual
role for M) and John Cleese (bringing his exquisite comic timing to Q's
maladroit assistant). But when the best thing about a Bond film is the
acting, you know something isn't right. Perhaps I've reached a point in my
movie-going life where a Bond film is a no-win proposition. THE WORLD is
not enough -- not enough creativity, and not enough welcome nostalgia
value. Even for fast food, the familiar tastes too familiar, and the
unfamiliar just tastes wrong.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Bond issues:  5.</PRE>
