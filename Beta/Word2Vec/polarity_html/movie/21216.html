BALANCE, THE (BILANS KWARTALNG) (director/writer: Krzysztof Zanussi;

(Jan), Mariusz Dmochowski (Director), 1975-Poland)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Marta (Maja) is a do-gooder. She sees a boy crying while she is in a
rush to go to work, and still stops to help him with the problem he is
having with his teacher. This is the same teacher her son has. So she
ends up meddling, telling the teacher what to do, which causes the
teacher to take it out on her son and fail him. She works as an
accountant in an office and is also the union representative, where she
gets a chance to help her friend and confidante out, who is accused of
stealing. She still insists on helping her friend even though her friend
talks to her boss about her behind her back, which the boss tells her
about. All she can say is, that she needs my help because she is weak.</P>
<P>By chance, she gets a lift to work by a former acquaintance, someone she
hardly remembers, a handsome trainer, Jacek (Marek Piwowski). An
attraction develops between the middle-aged woman and the athletic and
free spirited Jacek, who tempts her with his casual air and
sophistication that comes from traveling the world; but, she can't
decide whether to leave her husband Jan (Halina), or to stay with Jan
and try to make the marriage work for the stability of the family, even
if the marriage has lost a lot of its romance.What makes her decision
difficult is that she can't cheat on her husband without feeling guilty,
so she says that her choice will have to be to leave him or stay with
him as a faithful married wife.What also makes her decision difficult,
is that Jan is such a decent guy, who does nothing wrong, he does not
even try to tell her what to do when he picks up on what is going on.</P>
<P>Marta gets to know herself and what other people think of her, as she
agonizes over her decision. She learns that others think her do-gooder
nature causes more harm to others than good, that if she can't help in a
positive way she should step aside and let the other person fend for
themselves; that she does this because she is a self-indulgent person.</P>
<P>By putting herself through an emotional ringer, Marta does find out
about what she is really made of, and what her marriage means to her.
She is strengthened by the experience in a way that she has never felt
before.</P>
<P>The acting was convincing, but the story didn't have enough suspense in
it to sustain interest, especially when the ending was becoming
increasingly predictable, as the story wore on. What interested me in a
rather oblique way, was how tired life in Poland seemed, and how the
real enemy seemed to be the bureaucratic nature of the country, that was
off-handedly touched upon in the scenes at work, as the love triangle
waned in my interest. I thought of how different things were in America
during that time frame of the '70s, and how similar bureaucracies seem
to be wherever they exist, whatever the time frame is.</P>
