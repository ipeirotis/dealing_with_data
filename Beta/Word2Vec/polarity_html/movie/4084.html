<P>     Grief is a difficult subject for a motion picture to address.
Handled improperly, the emotion can be conveyed as shallow and
insincere.  A Hollywood film's insatiable need to contain feel-good
moments invariably diverts scripts in this direction.  MOONLIGHT AND
VALENTINO represents a constant struggle between presenting a heartfelt
examination of the effects of an unexpected death and manipulating the
audience.</P>
<P>     The function of a solid performance should be to elevate an
intelligent script to the next level.  In MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO,
however, the actors save a rather ordinary screenplay from going down
the drain.  There's nothing radically wrong with the material--it's
just mundane and predictable.  The movie doesn't contain any surprises,
and there are times when the legitimacy of the characters' emotions are
in question.  Those wanting an astonishingly genuine portrait of grief
should check out Krzysztof Kieslowski's vastly superior BLUE (the first
film in his THREE COLORS trilogy).  As good as Elizabeth Perkins is
here, she can't hold a candle to Juliette Binoche's emotionally
shattered Julie.</P>
<P>     Perkins is Rebecca, a thirty-something widow whose husband was
killed while jogging.  She's convincing in the role, where she's
constantly trying to cope with repressed emotions.  Her support system
includes her sister Lucy (Gwyneth Paltrow), her best friend, Sylvie
(Whoopi Goldberg), and her ex-stepmother, Alberta (Kathleen Turner).
None of these women are the picture of psychological stability, however.
Lucy, a chain-smoker whose idea of breakfast is a cigarette and a can of
Pepsi, hasn't been able to get over her mother's death from cancer--and
that happened fourteen years ago.  Sylvie is trapped in a dying marriage
with a husband she keeps at arm's length.  And Alberta, a big time Wall
Street mover and shaker, has become so caught up in the world of high
finance that she's lost the ability to relate on a human level.</P>
<P>     Perkins isn't MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO's sole shining beacon of
acting.  Gwyneth Paltrow (FLESH AND BONE, SEVEN) gives a wonderful
performance, mixing a natural upbeat energy with expressive eyes.
Paltrow is also blessed with the rare ability to deliver corny lines of
dialogue in a completely natural fashion.  Jon Bon Jovi, in a small role
as a housepainter who captures the eye of every woman in the film, also
acquits himself admirably.  Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner,
however, are not as impressive, with Goldberg seeming especially flat.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this film is the facile
manner in which it resolves all the various emotional tribulations.  The
ending of MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO is so silly and over-the-top that it's
more likely to have the viewer shaking her or his head than reaching for
a Kleenex.  Admittedly, there are moments likely to prompt a tear or
two, but there's also quite a bit that doesn't ring true.  Many of the
interpersonal conflicts (such as Lucy and Alberta's strained
relationship) feel like scripted contrivances; it's only when the story
delves into the characters' inner turmoil that it strikes the right
chord.  Predictably, the result is a mixed bag--a study of grief and
friendship that might have been more effective had the script been
better-focused and the director's approach less heavy-handed.</P>
