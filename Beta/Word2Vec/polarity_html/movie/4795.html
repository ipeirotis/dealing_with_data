<P>     Another butt-number in a season of long-sits.  Director Barbet 
Schroeder (KISS OF DEATH, REVERSAL OF FORTUNE) adapts the Rosellen 
Brown best seller to sluggish, somber effect.   As a soap opera-- 
did small-town rich-kid Eddie Furlong really kill his girlfriend?-- 
it's hardly compelling; as a morality play-- what happens when 
parents try to shield their kids from the consequences of inap-
propriate behavior-- it's a mess.  Even less appealing is Alfred 
Molina's character, a defense lawyer whose ethics are as a scary as 
the dye job he wears.  This crap belongs on television.  </P>
