<PRE>                     THE PLANET OF THE APES
               (a film review by Mark R. Leeper)</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: The much anticipated re-adaptation of the Pierre
    Boulle novel comes to the screen as  a dark and a little
    dreary film with lots of chases and fighting, but very little
    intelligence.  Visually  there is much to like about this
    version, but the approach is to take an adventure after the
    style of  GULLIVER'S TRAVELS and treat it as an action film.
    That makes it a film without much center.   Rating: 4
    (0 to 10), 0 (-4 to +4)</P>
<P>Pierre Boulle, author of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, wrote
PLANET OF THE APES  (a.k.a. MONKEY PLANET), the novel, as a
social satire.  It reads a lot like a fifth book of  GULLIVER'S
TRAVELS.  Humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and
humans have  been reversed, not unlike the roles of horses and
humans on Jonathan Swift's island of the  Houyhnhnms.  The novel
moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all
the  things most film fans know to be true about the nature of
the planet.  It seems to me there is also a  statement about
human cruelty to animals, but perhaps I was just looking for
that.</P>
<P>When Rod Serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968,
he added a number of Serling  touches, familiar from episodes of
THE TWILIGHT ZONE and changed the ending to make it  more
Serling-ish.  The final irony of the original version has become
film history.  Without it there  could never have been a "Planet
of the Apes" film series.  I can surmise only that Serling ran
into  serious script problems in how to handle the tricky
question of language.  In the book the apes had  their own
language and the human eventually learned that language.  That
could have been done in  the film, but that would have required
the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking.
Serling avoided this by having the apes speak English and, of
course, there is some justification  for that by the end of the
film.  Justifying why the apes spoke English may have even been
the  inspiration for his surprise ending.  But Serling never
tackles the all-important question of why a  supposedly
intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that
the apes speak his  own language, a language they had no
opportunity to ever hear.  Few viewers questioned this  serious
plot hole, however, and the film has become well respected in
cinema history.  Partial  credit at least should go to Jerry
Goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of Goldsmith's
best if not his best.</P>
<P>When the film's success called for sequels, the filmmakers turned
up the violence and they added  well-intentioned, though not very
subtle, political messages about what was happening in the
United States of the 1960s and 1970s.  While the first film had a
little shooting of guns and what  was there seemed a little half-
hearted, by the second film, BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE  APES,
there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the
series had a lot of violence  and chases.  The series concluded
with BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES in 1973.   Now director
Tim Burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again.</P>
<P>For those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful
to the book, Burton's new  version is even less faithful.  First,
he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes.
He has them both be intelligent, articulate races battling for a
dominance of the planet currently in  the hands, uh, make that
paws, of the apes.  That could be a good story too, but it is not
PLANET  OF THE APES.  As with the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE films and so
many other cinematic  homages to the third quarter of the last
century, the title makes promises that the filmmakers have  no
intention of honoring.</P>
<P>In 2029 Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg, not this world's most
expressive actor) works on a space  station increasing the
intelligence and usefulness of apes.  Then a convenient time
storm sweeps  him up WIZARD-OF-OZ-fashion and drops him on an
alien planet.  (Yes, he survives this storm,  but then no storm
is perfect.)  He quickly finds, not greatly to any surprise he
shows, that on this  planet apes rule and humans drool, but
everybody talks.  And the language they talk is Earth- English.
Apparently it does not even occur to Leo that there is a mystery
that needs to be  explained about that.  The fact it does not
occur to Leo and apparently didn't occur to Tim Burton  either is
the heart of the real horror of this film.  Both just assumed
that if apes were going to talk  the language they would speak
would be English.  In any case having one talking race dominating
another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and
more one of the master-slave  relationships.  Outside of Sudan
and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic.</P>
<P>Leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by
Ari, played by Helena Bonham  Carter.  Ari is an attractive ape
with close ties to high political power.  She is bent on making
the  world a better place.  Perhaps in a previous draft of the
script she was called Hil-Ari.  In any case  with makeup that
stifles her usual pout, Carter is just about as attractive as she
has ever been in a  film.  She may want to consider this to
become her standard look from this point forward.</P>
<P>It is not long before Leo escapes with some human and only a
couple of sympathetic apes.  This is  a further abandonment of
the source material.  The chase severely limits the interplay of
ape and  human and the examination of each's place in this
reversed society, each important in the book.   We cannot see how
the society works because most of the screentime society has
broken down.   We see the humans either separated from the apes
or fighting them.  Burton chooses visceral  thrills over cerebral
ones at almost every turn.  This is a miscalculation, as
characters so lacking in  empathy value are difficult ones to
place much emotional investment in.  They are basically chess
pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win.
The 1968 script had little subtlety,  with lines like "I never
met an ape I didn't like," but at least we cared for what
happened to Taylor,  the main character.  Most of what this film
has to offer is in the visuals.</P>
<P>The visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that
so much of the film takes place in  the night or in fog.  This
tends to limit close looks at the makeup.  In general it seems
much  improved from 1968.  The makeup team is led by Rick Baker
instead of John Chambers, who did  it for the 1968 version. In
1968 Chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper. It was realistic enough
to  almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion.
Chambers is good, but if anyone had a  chance to best him it
would have to be Baker.  Today audiences have higher
expectations; Baker's  visualization is really an improvement.
These visuals work nicely.  What does not work is the  wire-
assisted leaps some of the apes make.  They look like they were
inspired by the physics- defying leaps of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN
DRAGON.  Apes spring incredible distances.   Some of the best
scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape
posture, but when  they start flying through the air the effect
is lost.  One final visual problem is that the film  frequently
shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the
camera shows us only  a small group of people close-up.</P>
<P>Since the days of Lon Chaney and Boris Karloff few actors have
crossed over to stardom in a role  that required heavy make-up.
The one actor who has a shot is Paul Giamatti.  It is not that
his  lines are so good, most are silly jokes.  But he delivers
them very well.  He was always a  watchable actor, but has not
yet made stardom.  As the ape-trader Limbo he over-emotes to
overcome his ape make-up, but does it very well.  In doing so he
makes himself the most  interesting thing on the screen.  He is
probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories  of
Peter Ustinov's performance in SPARTACUS.</P>
<P>As an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from
the 1968 film and an old ape  played by Charleton Heston becomes
an allusion to the first film by itself.  Danny Elfman's score
has a nice primitive feel, but Jerry Goldsmith's 1968 tour de
force score is a real classic. That  score and the whole film
will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten.  I rate the
remake 4  on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.</P>
