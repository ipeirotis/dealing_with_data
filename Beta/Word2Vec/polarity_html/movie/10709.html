<PRE>TRACKS OF A KILLER (1995)
A "Turkey of the Week" film review by Justin Felix
Copyright 1998 Justin Felix</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: * (out of five)</PRE>
<P>Written by Michael Cooney
Directed by Harvey Frost
Starring Kelly LeBrock, Wolf Larson, James Brolin
Rated R (contains violence, profanity, and nudity)  100 minutes</P>
<P>Synopsis:  The president of a company wants to test his self-appointed
successor, who's psychotic, and thinks it's a great idea to spend a week
with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from
civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication
after a heavy snowfall.</P>
<P>Comments:  TRACKS OF A KILLER had a couple of strikes against it before I
even began watching it.  Strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled
the word GARBAGE on the videotape's sticker in black marker (not typically
a good sign when you rent a film).  Strike two came while the previews
played.  Did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie's quality (or
lack thereof) while watching the trailers that come before it?  Well, the
cheesy films being advertised before TRACKS OF A KILLER were films that no
one has ever heard of starring people no one knows, and they all looked bad
(definately not a good sign).  TRACKS OF A KILLER itself completed the
strikeout.  About the only positive thing this film had going for it was
the fact that it sports some nice scenery.</P>
<P>To be fair, the first half-hour or so promises at least a watchable
thriller.  Wolf Larson, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Hugh
Grant, adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the
film's title.  James Brolin and Kelly LeBrock seem equally adequate as the
loving couple Larson will later threaten.  Brolin's character, for some
inexplicable reason, thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin,
practically isolated, with LeBrock and Larson, whom he's decided to test
for the week before giving him full control of his company.  By the time
the characters arrive at the cabin, this film begins to become tedious.
Apparently, Brolin's successor's test involves chopping wood for the
fireplace and skiing, which don't seem like attributes necessary to run a
business in the city.  But, then again, what do I know about business?  I
do think, though, that they should have invested in some better furniture
for the cabin; its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the
slightest touch.</P>
<P>Larson's character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he
wants to kill.  This leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three
characters, which really isn't enough to sustain it.  The film's writer
must have taken a cue from Stephen King, as scenes from TRACKS OF A KILLER
seem lifted out of MISERY and GERALD'S GAME.  Larson and LeBrock fight and
torture each other (the tables get turned a couple of times) while Brolin
tramps around in the snow looking for help.  Some old guy's around too,
just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple,
who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film.  The old guy,
however, miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be
killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it's worthy of a chuckle
or two.  Outside of that chuckle, unfortunately, TRACKS OF A KILLER will
just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors,
for some reason, become increasing obnoxious.  If you're in a video store
and thinking about renting this turkey, don't.  Make tracks to a far
superior suspense film, like MISERY.</P>
