<P>     I'd like to say a word at this time about the proliferation of
genre parody/spoofs in the last year: stop.  In twelve months we've
seen at least half a dozen such films (LOADED WEAPON 1, FATAL INSTINCT,
ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS, etc.), with roughly that many laughs between
them.  It is saddest of all to see the masters of the form, the former
partners in the Zucker Abrahams Zucker comic triumvirate, among the
perpetrators of slipshod product.  Last year's HOT SHOTS! PART DEUX was
a tolerable but limp effort; still, it shines next to NAKED GUN
33-1/3.  The third installment in the series is only sporadically
amusing, and often crosses the pop culture cannibalism scale from
parody into self-parody.</P>
<P>     Leslie Nielsen returns as Frank Drebin, formerly a lieutenant for
L.A.'s Police Squad but recently retired after his marriage to
sweetheart Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley).  There are tensions in the
Drebin household, however, as Jane yearns for a child and Frank itches
to return to police work.  Frank gets his chance when Capt. Hocken
(George Kennedy) and Det. Nordberg (O. J. Simpson) ask him to go
undercover in prison.  His mission: to ingratiate himself with
incarcerated bomber Rocco (Fred Ward) and find out the target of a
planned terrorist attack.  While Frank goes to work in the Stateville
Prison, Jane takes off to find herself, and must decide whether or not
to stand by her man.</P>
<P>     The first ten minutes of NAKED GUN 33-1/3 offers some promise.
The opening sequence targets the train station steps sequence from
THE UNTOUCHABLES, and it features some solid belly laughs thanks to
a careful setup.  There are also a couple of winning moments in the
traditional opening credits featuring a roof's-eye view from a
moving police car, particularly a nod to the Death Star trench run
from STAR WARS.  Unfortunately, that's where NAKED GUN 33-1/3 hits the
runout groove.  In a ZAZ film, whether or not it works ultimately comes
down to how many of the gags work, and there are painfully few good
gags here.</P>
<P>     Part of the problem can be attributed to director Peter Segal.
Much of the enjoyment from earlier ZAZ efforts came from watching the
backgrounds, picking up jokes on the fringes of the frame.  In NAKED
GUN 33-1/3, jokes that in those earlier films would have been
background jokes practically have a spotlight set on them, such as the
wall-mounted clothing of notable lawmen in the Police Squad station
(one of the lawmen is J. Edgar Hoover ... you fill in the gag).  Even
though all three ZAZ boys are in the credits in some capacity (David
Zucker as writer, Jerry as producer and Jim Abrahams as executive
producer), their eye is missing in Segal's direction.  While none of
their films were afraid to go for groaners, the difference is that they
didn't underline them.</P>
<P>     Many of the films NAKED GUN 33-1/3 chooses to parody seem ripe for
the picking, but the execution stumbles.  Jane's departure with friend
Louise in a green Oldsmobile convertible seems to offer a great deal of
promise, but the expected THELMA & LOUSIE parody offers surprising
little payoff.  Ditto for the now (seemingly) obligatory CRYING GAME
reference, and an overlong sequence set in the prison.  Time after time
it looks like something worthwhile is coming along, and time after time
the jokes just fall flat.</P>
<P>     There is one other crucial factor worth noting in NAKED GUN
33-1/3, and that is the performance of Leslie Nielsen.  When he made
AIRPLANE!, Nielsen was a career B-movie actor known for dramatic heavy
roles, and he deadpanned his part perfectly.  Now, however, after
AIRPLANE!, the series POLICE SQUAD! and three NAKED GUN films, Nielsen
appears to be aping himself.  Instead of playing Drebin as the
oblivious stiff he had been before, he mugs and double-takes his way
through the film, having learned far too many bad lessons from his
horrendous Dollar Rent-A-Car spots.  Similarly, Fred Ward brings none
of the qualities Ricardo Montalban and Robert Goulet brought to the
first two films.  Rather than playing against the laughs, all the
performers seem to be playing with them, and much of the goofiness is
lost.</P>
<P>     NAKED GUN 33-1/3 is doing well at the box office.  It's too bad.
I was hoping we could avoid NAKED GUN .44: MAGNUM FARCE.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 naked guns:  3.</PRE>
