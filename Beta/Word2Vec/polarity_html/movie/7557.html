<P>     EYE OF GOD is the evocative title given by writer/director Tim
Blake Nelson to the film adaptation of his stage play.  A strange, dark
movie that ruminates upon several weighty questions about faith and the
existence of a Supreme Being, EYE OF GOD uses two stories spread over
four timelines to present its case.  The resulting examination of
characters and issues is expressed as a noir thriller.</P>
<P>     The film opens in the town of Kingfisher, Oklahoma, where a blood-
drenched, 15 year old boy, Tommy Spencer (Nick Stahl), is discovered
wandering around late at night.  The blood isn't Tommy's, but it's clear
that he has either witnessed or committed a terrible crime.  His stony
silence defeats all attempts by the chief of police (Hal Holbrook) to
uncover the truth about what happened.  Gradually, however, those of us
in the audience learn the story as the film flashes back on the
courtship and marriage of Ainsley Dupree (Martha Plimpton) and her ex-
con husband, Jack Stillings (Kevin Anderson).</P>
<P>     The strength of EYE OF GOD is Ainsley.  Not only is she superbly
acted by Martha Plimpton (playing against type as the shy, reserved,
small town girl), but Nelson's script does an excellent job of getting
into her head and uncovering her hopes, dreams, and motives.  As a
result, Ainsley becomes the kind of real person that an audience can
understand and sympathize with.  Even though her seemingly-happy
marriage is doomed from the start (Isn't this true of all happy
marriages in noir films?), we're glad to see the brief moments of joy
she manages to steal from an otherwise bleak life.</P>
<P>     Kevin Anderson is also effective, although his role is somewhat
less original and ambitious.  The fundamentalist "villain" has become
too much of a cliche over the years -- an easy target for film makers to
take aim at.  It's at the point now where if there's a fervently
religious character in a movie, he or she will inevitably turn out to be
a psycho.  In Jack's case, at least a partially-successful attempt is
made to turn him into a believable, multi-faceted individual. </P>
<P>     The themes that form EYE OF GOD's backbone are questions that have
troubled humankind since the dawn of history:  Is there a God? and What
is true faith?  However, while these are fascinating questions, the
perfunctory manner in which Nelson presents them doesn't do them
justice.  One scene in particular -- two characters sitting together
gazing out across a darkened lake -- illustrates the gap between the
film maker's intentions and the viewer's reaction.  It's a reflective,
melancholy moment, but lacks the profound spiritual texture that Nelson
ascribes to it.  As a philosophical excursion, EYE OF GOD falls short of
the greatness to which it aspires.  Its success comes through the manner
in which it captures the day-to-day, mundane aspects of the human
experience.</P>
<P>     Since PULP FICTION, non-chronological storytelling has become
popular.  Many movies take this approach out of the belief that it will
make them appear more cutting-edge, when, in reality, it often results
in needless confusion and frustration on the viewer's part.  With EYE OF
GOD, however, Nelson has a legitimate reason for structuring the film as
he does, and it works.  His intent is not to tell the story linearly
across time, but to group together scenes relating to the same subjects
(relationships disintegrating, doomed characters moving towards their
ends, etc.).  While this approach diffuses some of the film's mystery
potential, it replaces it with a different dynamic that retains our
interest. </P>
<P>     EYE OF GOD belongs in the same category as films like FARGO and
SLING BLADE -- it's the latest of many entries into the suddenly hot,
so-called "Southern Gothic" genre.  Yet, because of its structure and
the somewhat oblique manner in which it approaches its quietly appealing
lead character, this is a different shade of noir.  What matters here
isn't the blood and murder, but the people, their relationships, and the
concepts that define their lives and deaths.  Nelson's approach to this
material is ambitious, and, although he doesn't quite realize everything
he hopes to, there's enough here to make EYE OF GOD worth a look when
it's released commercially in the Fall of 1997.</P>
