<PRE>                                 TRUE LIES
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     TRUE LIES is an incredible show!  It had the energy of a great
powerful Mahler (or perhaps Shostakovich) symphony.  It was in four
parts, and except for the andante 2nd movement, it was one with all of
the horns and kettle drums at full force.  Like Mahler there was even
the light playful little parts in the heat of show as great and
hilarious one liners would send the audience into laughter and then off
we were again into another cliff hanger.</P>
<P>     For those non-musicologists, think of James Bond, but a lot more
believable.  Think of the recent movie SPEED, but give it some heart
and give it even better action shots.</P>
<P>     The set up of the plot is that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a spy but
his wife, Jamie Lee Curtis, thinks he is just a boring old computer
salesman.  As a spy, he is called upon to fight terrorists all over the
world.  The terrorists manage not to pay any attention at all to his
schedule of trying being at home with his wife and teenage daughter for
dinner.  And you thought your day was hectic.</P>
<P>     The only flaw in the movie is the slow 2nd part.  It works pretty
well with the exception of the interrogation scene which has been
called cruel by some critics.  You can judge for yourself.  I did not
care for that scene, but did like the other parts of the movement
albeit not near as much as the rest of movie.</P>
<P>     They spent $160 million on the movie, and it shows.  It has some
of the best and most realistic stunts in a long time.  The script was
very creative and imaginative.  In the movie trailers, you can see
Arnold on a horse chasing a bad guy on a motorcycle through a park,
through a hotel lobby and then on adjoining glass outdoor elevators.
This scene has great tension and yet is funny at the same time in the
movie.  There are many scenes where one must suspend disbelief, but in
this movie it is extremely easy.</P>
<P>     Of the many sidesplitting one liners is the explanation of why the
lead terrorist goes by the name of desert spider.  You will have to see
the movie to find out.  If I explained it, you wouldn't understand.
The director and producer was James Cameron (of Aliens fame).  If you
read the credits you can see how he fired the original 3 screenwriters
and then took over the writing job himself and rewrote their script.
It is terrific.</P>
<P>     I found myself clapping many times at some of the action scenes
during the show and many times I was laughing out loud.  Ditto for
numerous other members of the audience.</P>
<P>     The acting is top-notch all around.  Schwarzenegger is at his
best.  Curtis plays a good wife sidekick role that is varied and
believable.  I was surprised to see Tom Arnold do an excellent job as
the other spy.  Even the daughter (Eliza Dushku) has a small but
important role.  Teenagers I am sure will be cheering loudly for her.
Tia Carrere is a great and gorgeous terrorist helper.</P>
<P>     TRUE LIES runs a fast 2:21 (well edited by Conrad Buff IV, Mark
Goldblatt and Richard A.  Harris).  It is rated R.  Schwarzenegger
kills tons of people but with fairly minimal blood or gore.  I think
teenagers will love this movie, but I would not take a child younger
than 13.</P>
<P>     I recommend TRUE LIES most highly.  I came very close to rating it
****, but in the end I gave it *** 1/2 because the andante was not on
the same par as the rest of the movie.  See this film on biggest screen
you can find.  Too bad it is not available on IMAX.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
