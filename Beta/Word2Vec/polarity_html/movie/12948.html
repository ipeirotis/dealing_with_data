<P>     THE HANGING GARDEN was one of the hottest films to be shown at the 
1997 Toronto International Film Festival.  Not only was it the 
centerpiece of the "Perspective Canada" series, but it packed its first 
critics' screening and took home two prestigious prizes:  the Toronto 
City Award for the Best Canadian First Feature and the Air Canada 
People's Choice Award for the Most Popular Film.  While I'm not sure 
that the picture deserves the full share of praise heaped upon it at the 
festival, there's no denying that it's a fine, fascinating debut effort 
from director Thom Fitzgerald.</P>
<P>     THE HANGING GARDEN dissects one of the most dysfunctional families 
ever to appear on the silver screen.  It is by turns engrossing, 
horrifying, shocking, eccentric, and pretentious. In order to tell the 
entire story, the film moves back and forth through three different time 
frames.  There are overlaps in the periods, with characters from the 
past slipping into their future.  It's up to the viewer to determine 
whether they're real or imaginary – ghosts or physical embodiments of 
guilt and responsibility.  THE HANGING GARDEN opens in the present, with 
the wedding of Rosemary (Kerry Fox, last seen in WELCOME TO SARAJEVO) 
and Fletcher (Joel S. Keller).  It also marks the return home of Sweet 
William (Chris Leavens), Rosemary's brother, after a lengthy absence.  
William's appearance – he's thin and handsome – surprises everyone, 
since, when he left home as a teenager, he was grossly overweight.  Now, 
having started a new life away from his abusive father, he has learned 
to embrace his homosexuality and to like himself.  Also on hand for the 
wedding are the abusive father, Mac (Peter MacNeill); Rosemary and 
William's mother, Iris (Seana McKenna); their dotty old grandmother, 
Grace (Joan Orenstein); and their little sister, tomboy Violet 
(Christine Dunsworth).</P>
<P>     Before long, images from the past rise up to haunt William.  As an 
obese teenager (Troy Veinotte), he began to discover his gay urges one 
night while engaging in some innocent sex play with Fletcher.  Fearing 
that he might not be "normal," Iris arranged for him to have intercourse 
with a local woman who was willing, for a little money, to act as an 
instructor.  Meanwhile, Mac's attitude toward his son was shaped by the 
typical unpredictability of an alcoholic father – loving one moment, 
violent the next.  Only William's closeness with Rosemary (Sarah Polley, 
of THE SWEET HEREAFTER) kept him sane.</P>
<P>     THE HANGING GARDEN is brimming with symbolism.  Most of the 
characters – Sweet William, Rosemary, Violet, Iris – are named after the 
plants that grow in the family's extensive, well-groomed garden.  Each 
of the names says something significant about the person who bears it.  
Sweet William is vulnerable, Rosemary is biting, Violet is resilient, 
and Iris is proud and regal.  There's also a great deal of religious 
imagery, most of which is used to emphasize guilt (especially William's 
concerning his sexual urges).  On a number of occasions, the eyes of a 
Virgin Mary statue are seen to move.</P>
<P>     THE HANGING GARDEN  is not plot intensive, although the story 
offers at least one unexpected revelation (we anticipate a "surprise" 
concerning this plot element, but not the one that comes to light).  
Rather, it's about the characters -- how they interact and how the 
consequences of long-age actions have irrevocably altered their 
personalities.  From her teen years into her twenties, Rosemary has 
remained the same person (the performances of Fox and Polley, who work 
to match their presentations of Rosemary's mannerisms and personality, 
allow us to always see the character, not the actresses).  Sweet 
William, on the other hand, is vastly different in appearance, 
confidence level, and his ability to cope with the misery of his 
adolescent existence.  The watershed moment in William's life is THE 
HANGING GARDEN's central mystery.  Fitzgerald handles all of this 
difficult material like a pro (only occasionally going overboard with 
flashes of pretentiousness), displaying a distinctive visual style, and 
injecting a fair amount of humor into what is, in essence, a tragic tale 
about abuse, misunderstanding, and love gone awry.  THE HANGING GARDEN 
is a memorable debut.</P>
