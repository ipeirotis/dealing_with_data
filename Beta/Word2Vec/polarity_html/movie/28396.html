<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A visually playful version of Marcel Proust's epic "Remembrance Of
Things Past," which only covers the last volume of a lengthy
multi-volume book; but, continually makes references to other parts of
the book not covered in the film. The film is almost incomprehensible
without reading the book, as there's no time to introduce all of the
story line and characters (though an attempt was made to introduce the
main characters, as the dying Proust puts a magnifying glass to the
photos in his collection that bring back his memories); for those who
are not readers of the book this is not a substitute for the book, but a
work that, nevertheless, lives on its own merits. To expect anything to
be less than opaque from an undertaking of such a difficult work to
adapt to the screen is, perhaps, asking too much of anyone. To ask it of
Raul Ruiz, the stylish, surrealist Chilean exiled director, now a
citizen of France, is asking him to do what has never done before. In a
Ruiz film one must expect a work that is obscure and mysterious. That
this combination avant garde art film and literary period drama is
successful in its bold attempt to go where most other filmmakers fear to
go, into the labyrinthian world of Proust's dying era during the early
part of the 20th century and to come away with a work of such dreamlike
beauty, is simply an amazing feat. It's a film that doesn't necessarily
tell a story, but brings you instead to the conclusion of "Remembrance
Of Things Past" in an unforgettably eccentric way.</P>
<P>Proust's work is about the eternal nature of memory, as the opening
scene takes you into his cork-lined bedroom, where he is ill in bed
feverishly writing or dictating to the maid Celeste who is caring for
him; he is in rush to complete his writings, as he expects to die soon.
Proust will be played by all the following: with Marcello Mazzarella
(the Italian actor is a dead-ringer for Proust) as `Marcel' in the main
role, Andre Engel as `old Marcel,' Jean Leger as the actor who dubs
Engel, Georges du Fresne as `Marcel as a child,' Pierre Mignard as
`Marcel as an adolescent,' and director and actor Patrice Chereau as
`the voice of Marcel Proust.'</P>
<P>In this dying atmosphere Marcel will revisit his past, as the film is
not linear so we will see him as he was throughout his life -- from a
youngster to middle-aged to his present condition -- at any time during
the film. His memories are awakened by any memento in his bedchamber;
such things, as even the taste of a madeleine, a sweet pastry he loved
as a child, will bring back a memory of an earlier event. In these
memories he will reminds us, that to remember the past is to experience
its loss; the writer will act as our guide into his fictional and real
world: telling about such things as: his yearnings, his fears, his
feelings on death and love, the behavior of high class society, and
about the gossip and betrayals among his friends.</P>
<P>The film is made up of a succession of formal social gatherings in
palatial homes through which finely dressed women gossip wearing either
brocades or fashionable feathers sticking out of their hair; while the
formally dressed men parade around in the ballroom with the look of
contented bulls; the film's most artistic image is of the men's upturned
top hats covering the floor of an ornate waiting room. The time period
for most of the action is during WW1 (1914-18).</P>
<P>Marcel remembers Paris as a time of suffering from asthma, where he
wanders the deserted night streets because of the curfew. In one of the
decadent scenes he comes out of the night to rest and chooses to stay at
a male bordello, Palais des Felicites, where he spies the perverse Baron
Charlus (Malkovich) seducing young men to whip him. He chats with the
attractive Gilberte (Béart) when she returns alone to Tansonville to
check out her chateau after the death of her bi-sexual husband
Saint-Loup (Greggory) at the front. Marcel has always loved her because
she made him believe he was capable of loving others, something he
wasn't sure he was capable of doing. She's the daughter of his old
friend Odette (Deneuve), someone he has a special fondness for. He meets
the flirtatious violinist Morel (Perez), who is an army deserter, when
he's hiding in a dinghy hotel. Marcel talks with him about his strained
love relationship with the Baron, where now Morel despises him. And
through his conversations with the ghosts he conjures up on his
deathbed, he relates how hard the war was on all those he knew. We are
treated to funerals as spectacles that look oddly enough like convivial
affairs. Marcel finds refuge in his childhood memories to escape the
horror stories around him. Madame Verdurin (Pisier) appears giddy and
controlling at her parties, the ones Marcel seems to recall best. In one
party scene Madame Verdurin notices that Odette appears and Verdurin
objects to a lady friend: "What's she doing here? How does the
repeatedly married Odette dare to show her face in this reception,
especially now that her looks are gone?" Madame Verdurin's companion
replies: "But you're wrong, Odette looks ravashing."</P>
<P>The film is loaded with surprises, as Ruiz uses Proust in the film to
meditate on how he would have used the film if he were to film his epic
instead of write it. There are all sorts of camera tricks used: shots
frozen in time, imitations of how the filmmakers of that time period
shot their films, and the past and present fuse sometimes together in a
surrealistic way. In Proustian logic, one can be old and young at the
same time.</P>
<P>It's an ambitious project, enhanced by its starry cast, filled with
splendid visuals and tidbits from conversations that don't linger long,
as the film moves intractably into the poetical. It's Proust you're
getting, but from a daring perspective. This is not a film to see only
once. It is also a rare film, that shouldn't be missed, even if it's
messy and one is apt to get lost in its decadent mood swings and
enthralling aristocratic atmosphere. The film just feels right for
either the reader of the novel as I was some 30 years ago who was trying
to recall what I could from the book as I watched, or the novice to
Proust who might just be entertained by what he or she sees on the
screen. There are some who claim that this is the best written novel of
the 20th century, and it very well might be! This film works, despite
being able to only capture the book in spirit but not in its whole. But
there is no doubt about one thing, this is what good filmmaking is
about!</P>
