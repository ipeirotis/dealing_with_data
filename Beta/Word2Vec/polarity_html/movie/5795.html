<P>     When last we left Miss Emma Woodhouse, she was living in Beverly
Hills, happily in love with her step-brother...oh, and her name was Cher.
She was the lead character in a smart and utterly charming 1994 film
called CLUELESS, although she was never expressly named, and that makes
EMMA an experience of intense deja vu, even more so given the spate of
recent adaptations of other Jane Austen novels.  That places everyone
involved with EMMA in positions of uncomfortable but inevitable immediate
comparison -- director Douglas McGrath trying to portray upper class life
in 19th century England as artfully as SENSE AND SENSIBILITY's Ang Lee,
Gwyneth Paltrow competing with Alicia Silverstone for brattish
adorability, and so on.  Given these challenges, EMMA becomes almost more
entertaining than it already is on its own merits, another witty and
winning addition to the Austen canon, in which Paltrow becomes a bona fide
leading lady.</P>
<P>     Paltrow's Emma is a young woman living in the Surrey town of
Highbury, where her recent successful pairing of her former governess
(Greta Scacchi) and landowner Mr. Weston (James Cosmo) has her eager to
play matchmaker again.  Her target is the recently arrived Harriet Smith
(Toni Collette), whom Emma sees as an ideal match for the minister Mr.
Elton (Alan Cumming); Mr. Elton, however, has designs on someone else
entirely.  Mr. Frank Churchill (Ewan McGregor) is another possible suitor,
though Emma isn't sure that she doesn't want him for herself.  All this is
observed by Emma's brother-in-law Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam), who
tries to discourage her interference with honest counsel, then finds
himself caught up in Emma's complicated romantic world.</P>
<P>     As I considered Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in EMMA, I recalled an
old George Carlin routine in which he concluded that the reason dogs were
more expressive than cats was that dogs had eyebrows.  This observation in
no way means to compare Paltrow to a dog (far from it, though that is
another kettle of hormones entirely), but to describe why I think Paltrow
may be the most expressive young actress working:  in short, she has
phenomenal eyebrows.  If it seems I am doing an injustice to her ability
to interpret a line, or to her impressive British accent, I do not mean to
do so.  It is simply that there are moments in EMMA where Paltrow adopts a
facial expression so utterly perfect that her infuriating ability to make
you care about her despite her pettiness and manipulation seems drawn from
the soul of Austen's novel.  There are actors in films today that it is
distressingly clear will never know how to act with a degree of subtlety
which allows a shift of the eye or a hint of a frown to advance their
character.  At the ripe old age of 22, Gwyneth Paltrow gives a clinic on
acting for the screen in EMMA.</P>
<P>     It is a blessing that she is able to do so, since she has to carry
much of the first half of the film.  McGrath's rookie direction is
somewhat static, and the Harriet-Emma-Mr. Elton triangle is hampered by a
surprisingly stuffy performance by Toni Collette.  It is the late
introduction of Frank Churchill and Mr. Elton's new wife (Juliet
Stevenson) which kick-starts EMMA into enough energy to match its
cleverness.  Ewan McGregor (the heroin-addicted Renton in the current
TRAINSPOTTING) infuses Churchill with a charisma which proves a match for
Emma's nonchalance about her own love life; a scene in which he seizes her
fancy by proving men can gossip as well as women is an utter joy.  Emma
finds a match of another kind in Mrs. Elton, a self-obsessed busybody whom
Emma comes to dislike intensely, perhaps because they are too much alike,
and Juliet Stevenson plays the part of the shrew with a casual good humor
which undercuts the stereotype.  And I would be remiss in not pointing out
the delightful performances by Sophie Thompson as the garrulous spinster
Miss Bates and Jeremy Northam as the dashing Mr. Knightley.</P>
<P>     It is more than a bit distracting at times to be only 12 months
removed from the release of CLUELESS; duplicated details like Harriet
burning silly little mementos of Mr. Elton lose some of their snap in
their familiarity.  But McGrath's screenplay is a gem of humor and
sparkling characterizations, and is more than faithful to the spirit of
his source material.  Most importantly, he has cast his lead role with a
keen sense of its challenges -- he needed an actor with a willingness to
play a vain, foolish and snobbish young woman without winking at us to
make sure we don't dislike her.  She trusts her ability to make Emma's
good heart shine through her youthful conviction in her own infallibility,
and McGrath is wise to trust her as well.  Both prove far from clueless in
that respect.</P>
