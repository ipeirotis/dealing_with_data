<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A superior Western made from a routine story, featuring two of that
genre's greats who were both in their 60s at the time and both
accumulated a great deal of wealth due to their wise investments in oil
and real estate and livestock, Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott. This film
was meant to be their swan song, but McCrea was talked out of retirement
to play a few insignificant parts later on, before retiring from films
and becoming one of Southern California's wealthiest ranchers. This
low-budget Western appealed to both stars because it was really a homage
to their careers, as they would be playing aging gunmen, an extension to
the many different characters they played in their long film life--where
their combined film total must be over a few hundred. They were also
impressed with their young director Sam Peckinpah, who had made only one
feature before in 1961, "Deadly Companions." Because of their terrific
acting skills and Peckinpah's stylish direction, this film turned out to
be a classic, one of the better Westerns made.</P>
<P>The aging Steve Judd (Joel McCrea) just hired by the bank despite them
being skeptical that he's too old for the job, recruits his longtime
ex-deputy, the aging Gil Westrum (Randolph Scott), now working in a
carnival, into helping him transport a gold shipment from a mining camp
to the city bank. Heck Longtree (Ron Starr) is the junior partner of
Scott's and, against McCrea's better judgment, is talked into being a
part of the security team. Heck is wild, irresponsible, hot-headed, and
crazy over women -- but, he fits the pattern of their own youth.</P>
<P>When Scott hears from McCrea that there might be as much as $250,000 in
gold from the miners, he makes plans with Heck to rob that money, hoping
he could talk the straight-arrow McCrea into going along with his
scheme, by filling him with stories of how underappreciated and
underpaid they were as lawmen and now have nothing to show for it. But
he soon realizes that he can't talk him into it.</P>
<P>On their first stopover in their two day trek to the mining camp, they
stay at an isolated farmhouse, where resides a stern, embittered,
widower (R. G. Armstrong) and his attractive young daughter Elsa
(Mariette Hartley-her debut in films), who is kept under wraps by him.
He is rigidly quoting scripture for whatever he does, even getting into
a duel of scriptures with McCrea over a ham dinner. When he spots her
talking to the flirtatious Heck in the barn area, someone she is
attracted to, he reacts by striking her. The next morning, she sneaks
away from the farm and joins the bank guard trio, telling them she's
going to the mining town to marry her fiancé Billy Hammond (James
Drury), someone her father refused to let her see.</P>
<P>At the mining camp, her marriage to Billy turns out to be a disaster. He
and his redneck brothers (Oates, Anderson, Chandler and Jones) turn out
to be brutish swine, which appalls the sensitive Elsa. She wants to back
out of the honeymoon suite, which is lodged in the local whorehouse run
by Kate (Jackson), where all the brothers try to be the first to
consumate the marriage in a Biblical sense. She gets rescued by the
puritanical McCrea, who promises to take her back to her father. In
order to get her to leave the camp with the bank guards, the pragmatic
Scott sticks a gun in the drunken judge's (Edgar Buchanan) ribs, and
steals the marriage license. After a miner's court hears the case and
see no license, the miners who outnumber the trio--allow her to leave.</P>
<P>But on the road back, with the $11,000 in gold--not the high amount of
money Scott expected, the men become conflicted, as McCrea catches the
two trying to steal the gold and ties them up, promising to take them to
the town sheriff. The other problem is that the Hammond boys come after
Elsa and the gold, as it turns out they were the robbers the bank feared
when they hired McCrea.</P>
<P>These two gunmen realize that their time has come and gone, as in town
there are horseless carriages and Chinese restaurants, and they plainly
see the signs pointing to them as dinosaurs. For McCrea, this bank job
becomes a way for him to gain back the self-respect he has lost, after
years of working in various saloons as a bouncer, while for Scott, the
gold is his one chance to get some big money for his retirement. But as
it turns out, this job gives both of them a chance to look again at
their values, and through the plight of Elsa and young Heck, who loves
her, they see things are not always black or white, and both change
their opinions. In the end, they both come to their senses, standing
together as they shoot it out with the Hammond boys to protect the gold,
Elsa and their honor.</P>
<P>The film won a prize at the Venice Film Festival. This is one of
Peckinpah's more appealing films, it is visually stunning, fully
capturing the gorgeous mountain landscapes and comparing it with the
more gaudy view in the modernized town. It is also Peckinpah's warmest
portrait he paints of a woman's sufferings in any of his films, as one
can only feel pity for the anguish the sexually repressed Hartley has by
living in such a backward frontier settlement.</P>
