<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This 1950s sci-fi/horror cult classic opens with a dead body found on
the grounds of a secret experimental atomic test-site of a U.S. Air
Force base located in the remote Winthrop-Manitoba part of Canada. The
base is operated under the joint consent of Canada and the U.S., and is
being used to experiment on long-range radar installation capabilities,
using nuclear energy and beaming that power to boost the scanning range
of the experimental planes. This stuff is all hush-hush.</P>
<P>There is growing resentment toward the base in the small backward town
(can you blame them!), as the local residents are blaming the new base
for the poor production of milk due to the noise from the passing jets
disturbing the cows and they are scared of the rumors they hear about
fallout from atomic radiation. The military calls these people ignorant
and superstitious for not trusting them. Gee!</P>
<P>The attractive murder victim's sister, Barbara Griselle (Kim Parker),
agrees with the town officials that an autopsy won't be necessary, but
Major Jeff Cummings (Marshall Thompson), the base investigator, urges a
more careful investigation of this murder. He notes the look of extreme
horror on the dead man's face and surmises there is more to this death
than meets the eye.</P>
<P>The viewer watches as invisible forces next attack a farmer's wife
(Lala) and then the farmer (White), with each of them screaming,
throwing their head back, and grabbing at their neck and the invisible
force never letting go until the victims are dead. The local constable
Gibbons (MacKenzie) is very hostile to the Air Force people
investigating these crimes, he even has a fist fight with the major when
he sees him over at Barbara's house (I think he's a little jealous), and
refuses to co-operate in anyway. But the major finds out from the local
doctor, Bradley (Madden), and the military doctor (Winfield), that all
the victims had their brains sucked out of them as well as their spinal
cords removed.</P>
<P>The major also learns that Barbara is doing secretarial work for a
reclusive research professor, Walgate (Kynaston Reeves), and he notices
in her possession a manuscript for a book on "thought control," which
sparks his interest, thinking there might be a connection there to the
recent murders. His interest is further increased by his meeting with
the strange but amiable professor, as a fourth murder is committed. This
time it is the mayor who gets his brains sucked out and spinal cord
removed. And if that wasn't enough, Constable Gibbons on a search party
in the woods for the killer, disappears and shows up later in state of
shock, as he dies in the same manner as the others who were killed.</P>
<P>By this time the major and Barbara show a strong affection for each
other, and a little romance is blooming without even a kiss or holding
of hands taking place, though there is one scene where she comes out of
the shower with just a towel on and you know that got the major's
attention. Now this romance could be taken for a serious one. But the
major is a busy man, so romance must take second place in this film. It
seems that the major is the only one on the base who does any work. The
security officer, Captain Chester (Kilburn), he's more into doing
paperwork than fieldwork, and the colonel, Butler (Maxted), who is good
at delegating all responsibility to the major, and is therefore left
with a clear mind to make the big decisions, like ordering the major to
get the killer before the locals really get mad and try to shut down the
base. So, you see, the major is a very busy man.</P>
<P>The major begins his investigation for real by speaking to the professor
without holding back that the he is under suspicion. He believes that
the professor is involved with the murders, especially when he learns
from his security officer, that the F.B.I. has a file on the professor
doing psychic research with atomic power and one of the books he
published is on cybernetics.</P>
<P>Lucky for the major, he borrowed Barbara's searchlight before going to
the local cemetery, because when he sees someone fleeing the mayor's
airtight mausoleum, he enters it and gets locked in there, and if
weren't for Barbara knowing where to find him, the major would have
perished that night.</P>
<P>It now becomes obvious that the professor is involved in this mystery,
and the fun part of the film begins, or some might think the film really
goes out of whack from here on. The prof comes clean and goes into
detail how he created these invisible mutant creatures by tapping into
the base's atomic power source and putting an electrical charge to his
brain. He now urges the Air Force to destroy the nuclear plant, or else
the invisible creatures can't be stopped. But things are not that
simple, the atomic plant malfunctions and can't be shut down, and to my
delight, the creatures become visible because of the increase in atomic
power in the nuclear plant.</P>
<P>What's viewed on screen are brains with a spinal cord attacking
everybody they see, killing all the people manning the nuclear plant.
The colonel is tremendous in the crisis, he keeps popping these hopping
brains with his .45 pistol and it turns out they are mortal, turning to
mush when shot. There are great special effects, using stop-motion
animation to show the brains moving around! Meanwhile, the colonel
realizing the tight situation they are in, tells the major to
single-handedly go into the nuclear plant and dynamite it. The major
leaves before Barbara could talk him out of it. As some comfort, the
security officer tells her, don't worry, if anyone could succeed in this
impossible situation, it's Jeff. Luckily the genius professor runs out
to act as a diversion for the hopping brains and gets devoured by three
of them, giving Jeff a chance to complete his mission.</P>
<P>As entertainment value, this film should hit the right spot: it's a
screamer. As anything greater, the story made little sense. This is just
another mutant B- flick that is missing most of its brain. If the
invisible creatures were supposed to bring with them an anti-atomic war
message, the message was garbled and got lost somewhere along the way
along with man's free will to resist the invisible creatures (who
represent the forces in man that bring about war).</P>
