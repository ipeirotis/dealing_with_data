<P>     In this Year of Our Lord 1999, when all things millennial are hotter
than the coming Apocalyptic purges, I give you David Fincher -- official
filmmaker of the dark night of our collective 21st century soul.  SEVEN
was one of the decade's most chilling visions of societal madness made
flesh; THE GAME turned existential crisis into engrossing suspense.  No
one in popular culture seems to understand our demons better.  No one more
effectively shows the deceptive ease with which our stable world can be
yanked out from under us.</P>
<P>     In his adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's savagely brilliant novel FIGHT
CLUB, Fincher delves once again into the bowels of our uber-psyche --
quite literally in the propulsive, Dust Brothers-scored opening credits
sequence -- and announces that a lot of us are walking very close to the
edge.  Our narrator (Edward Norton) is not unnamed without cause.  He's an
anonymous man driven to compulsive designer-label shopping and chronic
insomnia by a dehumanizing job (he investigates malfunctions for an auto
manufacturer, deciding whether a recall will be more expensive than paying
out-of-court personal injury settlements), a man who attends illness
support groups for cathartic release he can find nowhere else.  Then he
meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a man with a vision.  After an evening of
bonding during which they gleefully beat each other up, Tyler and the
narrator begin Fight Club, an underground organization where ordinary men
release their inner beasts through bare-knuckle brawls, and ... well, the
first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club.</P>
<P>     It might surprise a lot of people to discover that FIGHT CLUB is
actually a comedy.  Certainly it's not a comedy in the BIG DADDY or MICKEY
BLUE EYES sense, and not just because this one is actually funny.  It's a
comedy like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE was a comedy, a social satire so caustic
you laugh with a sharp intake of breath.  Norton's wonderfully dry
narration includes dozens of scathing punch lines, many of them drawn
directly from Palahniuk's text.  Some of FIGHT CLUB's conceits are
outrageously inspired, like guerrilla theater projectionist Tyler splicing
single frames of pornography into family films, or the creation of
boutique soap from liposuctioned human fat ("We were selling rich ladies
their own asses back to them at $20 a bar").  As performed by Norton, a
perfectly manic Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter (the emotional burn-out who
becomes Tyler's lover), FIGHT CLUB is startlingly hilarious.</P>
<P>     And it had to be; there's no other way to tell a story like FIGHT
CLUB without wallowing in didacticism.  Many critics and social
conservatives have already offered up kill-the-messenger diatribes against
the film's brutality and anarchist sub-plots, yet another depressing
reminder that some people need their messages delivered to them in solemn
"isn't this a very, very bad thing" tones.  At its heart, FIGHT CLUB is a
warning about the percolating discontent that has exploded into
well-publicized acts of violence in this country.  It also peeks into the
capacity for violent action we may not even realize we possess, the
testosterone id bubbling beneath the veneer of civilization.  As Tyler
becomes a messiah for his disaffected devotees, FIGHT CLUB shows just how
quickly fascism can materialize when the rabble are roused.  If the
approach to those subjects had ever become overtly preachy, FIGHT CLUB
would have become a glossy social science dissertation -- a big screen
version of Susan Faludi's emasculated-American-male study "Stiffed."
Instead, FIGHT CLUB taps into something primal, then takes it into the
realm of the absurd -- subliminal penises, liposuction soap and all.</P>
<P>     Weaving it all together is Fincher, as distinctive and unconventional
a filmmaker as any working in mainstream theatrical films.  FIGHT CLUB is
a kinetic work with plenty of visual flourishes and jolting sound design,
yet it never feels like an all-out sensory pummeling -- it's the film
Oliver Stone probably wanted NATURAL BORN KILLERS to be, but lacked the
subtlety to pull of.  The film only sags during a late surge of
exposition, a necessary evil that still feels awkward.  When Fincher is
allowed to plunge into FIGHT CLUB's dizzying array of themes and subtexts,
the result is as provocatively entertaining a film as you could hope for.
If the violence unnerves -- or becomes even more unnerving when
accompanied by vicious wit -- that's only because it should.  FIGHT CLUB
keeps you off balance, its incendiary vision leavened by the unexpected
humor.  This time around, David Fincher gets to whistle in the dark night
of our collective 21st century soul.</P>
