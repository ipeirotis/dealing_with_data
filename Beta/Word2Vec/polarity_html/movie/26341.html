<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Another pretentious film from the director Lawrence Kasdan (The Big
Chill/ Silverado/ Grand Canyon/Wyatt Earp). I never saw a film of his
that wasn't arty-farty. This time he created a comedy/fantasy film about
a quack psychologist in a small town who subversively discusses his
patient's problems with others.</P>
<P>The film suffers from an interminable case of blandness and exhibits an
unwillingness to go beyond its cute little tale to see the dangers of
someone who invades another's personal privacy by pretending to be
someone he isn't, especially in a critical field such as the mental
health one. Instead the film focuses on what a wonderful person Dr.
Mumford (Loren Dean) is and how by using common sense there is no need
to go to school and train for his profession, as long as he can listen.
In other words, the film makes the assumption that anyone with
sensitivity could be a psychologist. This film was so weak and
misleading in purpose, its story so dry and unconvincing, that it was a
chore to just watch it and not give up on its arrogant attitude. It
seemed to get stuck on itself and had no movement for the longest period
of time.</P>
<P>The film also makes no attempt to show anything about Mumford's
character or his inner being, except by telling the mere biographical
data a TV news report might tell about someone arrested as an impostor.
Mumford remains as bland and unknown by the film's conclusion as he was
throughout the film. This guy must have some serious mental problems to
do what he did, yet there is no treatment offered for him, as he's the
one in the film who needed it the most and his only penalty is a
slap-on-the-wrist jail sentence in a country club prison and a heroes
acceptance by the town. This is stupidity glorified beyond a point of
belief. There was nothing this film had to say that made any sense, and
to top it off, there was no comedy in its attempt to be a screwball
comedy. Frank Capra used to make social films like this in the '30s and
'40s, but those goody-goody themes have long been played out. If they
weren't, they would still be making films like that.</P>
<P>Mumford took the name of the town of Mumford, forged his credentials,
and became the new psychologist in this once depressed mill town, which
has now recovered thanks to the efforts of a young computer geek named
Skip, (Jason Lee), who is worth three billion dollars from his Panda
Modem Company, whose company produces 23 percent of the world's modems,
where he employs a large percentage of the town. Mumford, after being a
crooked investigator for the IRS, a drug user, and having an affair with
his wife's partner, goes on the run after the IRS blames him for framing
an innocent businessman, who got so depressed that he took his life. He
ends up living with monks in a remote part of Arizona before coming to
Mumford. He rapidly becomes a very popular therapist even to his
surprise, and catches the jealousy of the town's two other therapists,
Dr. Ernest Delbanco (Paymer) and Dr. Phyllis Sheeler (Jane Adams).</P>
<P>He discovers he can treat those who are lonely and those who have sexual
problems: Skip is lonely, but does not want to be with women he knows
only want him for his money; a schoolgirl (Zooey Deschanel) who is
self-hating and asocial, is sent for pro bono therapy by her school
system to be rehabilitated by him; a pharmacist (Pruitt Taylor Vince)
who is afraid of his sex drive, is told that porno is OK; and, a young
lady he falls in love with, who suffers from a chronic fatigue syndrome,
Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis), is encouraged to get out of the house and
fight her depression. I found the last vignette particularly phony and
disconcerting, since the film has the arrogance to say that her illness
is merely psychological, which goes against most evidence of the disease
and discredits those who suffer from this very real illness, as they
know that its physical nature is very serious, and their treatment
requires a competent medical doctor seeing them, not a quack.</P>
<P>Of course, the phony psychologist cures her and the last act of the
film, after he helps everyone he comes into contact with, is to confess
about his deception. He is told to come clean with his past by his
landlady neighbor, the only black woman seen in town, who owns a popular
diner, Lily (Alfre Woodard). She is someone who has stopped believing
that there is a man around for her, but who is someone with enough sense
and strength not to need a shrink. She is the one Skip falls in love
with and through Mumford's help they get together.</P>
<P>But before he can tell anyone that he's a fraud, Robert Stack on the TV
program Unsolved Mysteries tells his troubled story and asks the public
to turn the missing person in.</P>
<P>There was nothing fantastic about this fantasy film, not even the
fantasy. It was a film that tried to make you feel good about your
problems and tried to show how they would go away if you can just get
someone to listen to you: anyone. It was meant to be a likable film like
elevator music is meant to be not upsetting, as a sort of universal
music of acceptance. In both cases the effort wasn't worth it, by trying
to be so bland it had more of a negative effect than if it was trying to
say something worthwhile. This was a film made up of phony characters,
whose problems were surface deep and were covered in the most
superficial of ways. It was hard for me not to see this film as an
excuse to justify doing something that is criminal and then explaining
that it is OK, look at all those who were helped. If we followed the
film's logic, then it would be OK for someone to pretend to be a
surgeon, as long as he operated successfully.</P>
