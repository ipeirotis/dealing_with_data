<PRE>Rating: * * *½ out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Starring: Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones, Annabeth Gish, Bruce Greenwood, Michael
Gaston.</P>
<P>Rated R for violence, language and some sexuality.</P>
<P>Underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today. 1998's
'Hope Floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the
year. We always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and
audiences pan on them. This year 'Double Jeopardy' is one of those films.
Critics are calling it predictable and worthless, audiences are disappointed
with it and think it was a disappointment. But as I viewed 'Double Jeopardy' I
found that it was a great movie, it has a surprising sense of humor and a big
dose of heart, along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and
there it certainly is a really good movie.</P>
<P>The always wonderful Ashley Judd plays Libby Parsons, a woman with a seemingly
normal life: a great loving husband, a beautiful son and a great friend. Her
husband Nick Parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the
sailboat she has always wanted. After a night of bliss Libby wakes up in the
middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat, her
husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck. Of course being in
shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her.</P>
<P>However she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was
worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for
the money. She pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six
years. While making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her
and she hears him say hi to his dad, which makes Libby's heart stop right
there. She realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead, one of her
cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she
cannot be convicted of it again. Which means she can shoot him in the middle of
Mardi Gras and they cannot do anything about it.</P>
<P>After she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer Tommy Lee
Jones. He is a man who has had his share of bad things. While out for the day
she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband, leading
up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not. Whatever
happens the film was excellent to me. I found the writing well-written as well
as the acting was great. Ashley Judd is such a talented and beautiful actress
that she is a hero in a sort in this movie. Even if you know what is going to
happen in the end, you don't know how. </P>
<P>This is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen,
except you don't know how they are going to make it happen. It could be one way
or another, it could be this way or that way. The movie is highly stylized and
extremely well-made. It gets most of it's power from the two leads: Ashley Judd
and Tommy Lee Jones both give excellent performances. The characters are
well-realized and believable and we feel Libby's pain when she cannot see her
child for 6 years.</P>
<P>Even though a lot of critics didn't like the film, I loved it. The director
took his time making the movie, and put a lot of shadowing in the movie. I
found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some
predictability. It moved at a fast pace, has suspense, humor, heart and great
acting. It earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was.</P>
