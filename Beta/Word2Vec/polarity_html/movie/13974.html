<P>     BLADE is a comic book adaptation, which in recent years has meant you
could expect one of two approaches:  brooding and violent (THE CROW,
SPAWN) or gaudy and hyper-kinetic (BATMAN AND ROBIN, THE MASK, TANK GIRL).
BLADE is no exception...sort of.  Instead of choosing one familiar path or
the other, the makers of BLADE have chosen both -- it's brooding, gaudy,
violent _and_ hyper-kinetic.  The surprising good news is that it comes
impressively close to succeeding at both.  The bad news is that means it
doesn't entirely succeed at either one.</P>
<P>     The premise alone is intriguing enough to give it a fair shot.  In a
prologue set thirty years ago, we see a woman dying from a vampire attack
just as she gives birth to a son.  Flash forward to the present day, where
that son has grown up to be Blade (Wesley Snipes), a hybrid with all the
strength of a vampire but none of the weaknesses -- he can walk in
daylight with impunity, eat a pizza with extra garlic, and so on.  That
makes him ideally suited for his vocation as vampire hunter, which he and
his weapons guru/mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) carry out with
extreme prejudice.  His latest challenge is a young upstart named Deacon
Frost (Stephen Dorff, the poor man's Kevin Bacon), who plans to unleash
some sort of vampiric armageddon upon humanity unless Blade can cut him
down to size first.</P>
<P>     All right, the latter portion doesn't qualify as any sort of
intriguing.  It's more in that gaudy and hyper-kinetic category, a
climactic conclusion to two hours of punishing, extremely sanguine action.
It's also extremely effective action, directed by former special effects
make-up artist Stephen Norrington at the kind of blistering pace generally
associated with Jackie Chan films.  Make no mistake, BLADE _moves_, with
dynamic fight sequences and a parade of gruesome special effects --
exploding vampire heads, disintegrating vampire bodies, vampire skeletons
crawling out of their skins.  With Snipes anchoring the action as the
chiseled anti-hero, BLADE's frenzied, over-the-top battles offer plenty of
visceral thrills.</P>
<P>     Of course, it has to pause every once in a while for exposition,
which usually is where films of this kind collapse into a puddle of
stupidity.  BLADE, on the other hand, teases with provocative concepts
that ultimately go nowhere.  The tormented hero is nothing new in the
modern "graphic novel" comic book milieu, but BLADE adds the notion of our
protagonist as (in Deacon's words) a vampire Uncle Tom, trying to pass
himself off as human because he's uncomfortable with his vampire lineage.
There are more hints of vampires as a persecuted minority in scenes of a
vampire council discussing how they have struck bargains with humans for
their mutual survival.  When the militant Deacon rejects the assimilation
tactics of his elders in favor of "vampire power," it could have been the
basis for more complex themes than you'd ever expect from a comic book
thriller.  Is Blade, for all his righteous wrath, merely engaging in a
sort of "ethnic cleansing?"  Could Deacon just be firing up a "we're here,
we're vampires, get used to it" civil rights movement?</P>
<P>     Interesting questions, if anyone had bothered to ask them.
Unfortunately, the politics of vampirism quickly gives way to simple,
rapid-fire good guy vs. bad guy stuff.  There's a token pseudo-romantic
interest (N'Bushe Wright), a thick-headed henchman (Donal Logue), and a
villain whose only distinguishing characteristic is his villainy.  BLADE
keeps setting you up to expect that the sub-text is going to matter
somehow, then always bails out for another round of spinning back-kicks
and shotgun blasts.  I suppose you could take a glass-half-full view and
applaud both the quality of the action and the mere attempt to give depth
to the viscera.  There's just too much viscera, and not enough depth, to
take that attempt seriously.  It's an exciting under-achiever -- to
brooding to be pure gaudy fun, to gaudy to let its brooding go anywhere
interesting.</P>
