<PRE>                                  SPEECHLESS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Michael Keaton, Geena Davis, Christopher Reeve.
Screenplay:  Robert King.
Director:  Ron Underwood.</P>
<P>     All right, all right, we get the point:  despite all similarities
to the best-selling story, SPEECHLESS is *not* based on the romance
between 1992 Presidential campaign rivals James Carville and Mary
Matalin.  In fact, the script was in development well before 1992.
Still, the comparisons are inevitable, until one realizes a critical
difference.  No, it's not that the SPEECHLESS twosome are speech
writers, not campaign managers; it's that Carville and Matalin's story
is actually interesting.  SPEECHLESS is a limp, poorly structured
would-be romantic comedy.</P>
<P>     SPEECHLESS is set during a New Mexico senatorial campaign, where
Kevin Vallick (Michael Keaton) and Julia Mann (Geena Davis) meet and
get romantic one night when neither one can sleep.  What neither one
realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign:  Kevin is
a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the Republican candidate's
speeches, while Julia is the chief speech writer for the Democratic
candidate.  At first each one believes that the other has an ulterior
motive for the relationship, but eventually they let down their guard
and become closer.  But there are plent of obstacles in the way,
including Julia's stud-reporter fiance (Christopher Reeve) and a series
of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and
politics.</P>
<P>     The standard formula for a movie like SPEECHLESS would have the
two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the
end that they're crazy about each other.  Screenwriter Robert King
completely subverts expectations by throwing Kevin and Julia into each
other's arms in the first fifteen minutes, then developing the
antagonism.  It's a noble attempt to shake things up, but unfortunately
it just doesn't work.  Part of the fun of watching sparring in a
romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the
characters do, but in SPEECHLESS they already know they're attracted to
each other, and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so
they'll admit that they love each other already.  There is such a
herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even
King's sharp dialogue can't prevent SPEECHLESS from becoming repetitive
after about half an hour.</P>
<P>     Inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the
performances of Geena Davis and Michael Keaton, and with those
performances most of their scenes together.  The problems begin with
their initial courtship, which does virtually nothing to establish
Julia's character and merely establishes that Kevin is a wise-ass.
Davis is radiantly beautiful, and Keaton is generally entertaining, but
these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems
to matter one bit.  In a couple of scenes, like a quiet moment sitting
at a fountain, they actually achieve some measure of connection.  For
the most part, however, they're just actors spouting lines.  You keep
waiting for a little spark, and it never happens.</P>
<P>     Perhaps most disappointing is that King and director Ron Underwood
completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from
SPEECHLESS's politics.  The setting seems perfect for a high- energy
battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix, but that's
never the tone that Underwood is going for.  He wants a warm, fuzzy
romance compatible with Marc Shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score,
and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between Kevin
and Julia fades into the background.  It might as well have been a
story about rival grocers, and every single character is about as
uninspired as he or she could possibly be.</P>
<P>     I was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to
enjoy Robert King's previous screenplay, the Dana Carvey flop CLEAN
SLATE, so I had some hopes for SPEECHLESS.  But while there is wit in
the words, this is a script which was probably much better on paper.
On screen, it's still paper thin.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 political campaigns:  4.</PRE>
