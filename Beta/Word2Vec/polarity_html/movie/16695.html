<P> American History X (1998) 3 1/2 stars out of 4. Starring Edward Norton,
Edward Furlong, Stacy Keach, Avery Brooks, Beverly D'Angelo and Elliott
Gould. Directed by Tony Kaye.</P>
<P> American History X is a brutal, saddening story of hate and the bitter
fruit it sows.</P>
<P> The movie is a powerful and disturbing drama about prejudice, its
consequences and family.</P>
<P> And director Tony Kaye gets right in your face with his message. Much of
the movie is shot in close-up, so you can look these people in the eyes.</P>
<P> The drama centers around two brothers, Derek (Edward Norton) and Danny
(Edward Furlong). The story is narrated by Danny, who idolizes his older
brother.</P>
<P> Derek, following the death of his firefighting father - who was shot while
battling a blaze at a crack house - succumbs to a philosophy of hate and is
transformed into a charismatic leader of a white power movement.</P>
<P> Derek is sent to prison for murder. There, he goes through a process of
self-discovery, realizing that what he thought he knew and what he was
taught by Cameron (Stacy Keach), the behind-the-scenes manipulator of the
skinheads, is bogus.</P>
<P> Released from prison after three years, Derek arrives home and finds Danny
starting to trod Derek's old path - hanging around with Cameron and the
other skinhead losers.</P>
<P> Derek works to dissuade Danny from that life of hatred, trying to convince
him of the lies and intolerance spewed by Cameron.</P>
<P> Danny, meanwhile, must rewrite a school paper for his history class
because the one he wrote on Mein Kampf - at Cameron's urging - was
rejected. The principal orders him to write about Derek, how he feels about
him and the events leading to Derek's incarceration.</P>
<P> Through this process, and through talks with Derek, Danny slowly comes to
realize the truth - that the venom spewed by Cameron and his ilk creates
nothing but misery.</P>
<P> Kaye and screenwriter David McKenna spare no one as the sins of one
brother are visited upon the other.</P>
<P> Many disturbing scenes, especially the trashing of a Korean-owned grocery
story, will leave you breathless in their mindless violence.</P>
<P> Norton gives a powerful performance, his best since his stunning debut in
Primal Fear. He shows Derek's intelligence, his charisma and his
commitment, both to the cause to which he thought he believed and, after
his release from prison, his resolve to extract his brother from the
ill-fated path he followed.</P>
<P> Norton's performance is of Academy-Award caliber.</P>
<P> Furlong, best remembered as young John Conner from Terminator 2: Judgment
Day, brings a sense of confusion mixed with adulation to his role as the
impressionable younger brother.</P>
<P> With his skinhead haircut and slit-eyed glance, one can see the virus of
hate planted in the boy begin to grow. When Danny is around Derek, his
entire posture changes. He is more the young, adoring brother hanging on
every word said by his older sibling.</P>
<P> There is a powerful moment when the brothers take down all the hate
literature and Nazi paraphernalia hanging in their bedroom. No words are
needed. Their actions say it all.</P>
<P> Later, Derek stares long and hard at the large, black swastika tattooed
over his heart, with a look combining regret and shame. Again, without a
word, Derek places his hand over his heart in order to obliterate the foul
reminder of his past life.</P>
<P> Kaye has gathered a rather impressive cast. Keach, as Cameron, is, in
Derek's words, "a chicken hawk," preying on young dissatisfied minds to
convert to his cause, sending them out to do his dirty work while he stays
in the shadows. Keach speaks in calm, low, soothing tones, pouring his ugly
philosophy into the ears of boys such as Danny. He is a snake in human
form.</P>
<P> Avery Brooks, as the school's principal and Derek's former teacher, is a
rock of integrity, a man who wants to help the brothers regain their moral
equilibrium.</P>
<P> Beverly D'Angelo and Elliott Gould are featured as the brothers' mother
and her would-be suitor. Gould's Murray, a liberal Jewish teacher, is
driven away by Derek's racist and anti-Semitic tirades.</P>
<P> Kaye refuses to allow a happy ending. Tragedy, built from hate and
bigotry, strikes Derek's family, and the consequences of his earlier
actions are brought home in the most brutal manner.</P>
<P> American History X is not a comfortable movie. It will make you squirm. It
will shock and disgust you. But most of all it will sadden you. The movie
is a fine treatise on hate, a movie that should not and cannot be ignored.</P>
