INNOCENTS WITH DIRTY HANDS (director: Claude Chabrol; cast: Romy
Schneider (Julie Wormser), Rod Steiger (Louis Wormser), Paolo Giusti
(Jeff Marle), Jean Rochefort (Maître Légal),  François Maistre
(Commissaire Lamy), Pierre Santini (Commissaire Villon), François Perrot
(Georges Thorent), Hans-Christian Blech (Judge), 1975-France)</P>
<P>Given the context of the material for this pulp thriller, it is
surprising that this English speaking Chabrol film, set in St. Tropez,
is as diverting and suspenseful as it is. Credit must be given to an
ingenious script, and acting kudos, especially for Romy, Jean, François,
and Pierre, for making it possible for us to be fascinated with all the
twists in the ever changing plot. The storyline starts off simply as a
case of a boorish wealthy husband, Louis (Steiger), and his attractive
younger wife, Julie (Romy), having a bit of a row in front of Julie's
new acquaintance, her handsome neighbor Jeff (Paolo), who introduces
himself as being a hack writer. Louis drunkenly asks his wife in front
of Jeff, "Why don't we ever make love ?" The obvious affair between
Julie and Jeff begins as soon as Louis retires for the night, and with
Chabrol you know that is just the beginning of more mysterious things to
ensue.</P>
<P>Chabrol will go on to explore many of the themes he has used before, to
belittle the bourgeois lifestyle, to question why sex is the most
important thing in a relationship, and how money is such a psychological
part of one's mindset. This is all done, as the cheating couple decides
to kill Louis and dump his body in the sea, so that he will never be
found and Julie can inherit everything, and when things quiet down they
will get back together.</P>
<P>A visiting Paris police inspector and his friend, the local police
inspector take an interest in the case, suspecting foul play, never
convinced of Julie's story that her husband is missing. They come to the
conclusion, after much spirited conversation about the case over some
hearty meals and good liquor, that she is having an affair with Jeff, as
important clues pop up, like her missing earring in Jeff's apartment, an
envelope addressed to Jeff, postmarked after her husband was reported
missing, that is found in the front seat of a crashed car over the side
of the seacoast, a car that Julie told the police her husband loaned
Jeff, and then there is the information they gathered from Louis's
doctor, that Louis made up the story of having a heart condition because
he was ashamed of his impotency and wanted Julie to think that he
couldn't perform because of his bad heart. The gut feeling of the police
is that Julie and her boyfriend killed Louis and dumped his body out to
sea. But Julie's lawyer, Mr. Légal (Rochefort), you just can't top that
for a lawyer's name, as he goes about his lawyer's business in an
abrasive and madly befitting way, using logic and the command of his wit
to the nth degree to get his client cleared of all the circumstantial
charges. Mr. Légal is a pip, a pleasure to see on screen; a character
nonpareil, played to perfection, someone who, despite his small part,
you will remember long after seeing the film.</P>
<P>Just when you think you think you got what is happening, the twists keep
coming, like Louis coming back to Julie, getting sex from her on the
expensive carpet, just like she gave it to Jeff, telling her he's a new
man because of them (Too bad they didn't have Viagra then). A little
Freudian transference is thrown into the stew, as Louis goes on to boast
how he outfoxed the couple, staying sober one night to spy on them,
aware of their love making and plans to do him in, he thereby, jumps
Jeff first, throwing him into the deep blue sea. But if you think you
got where the story is going now, you better get ready for a few more
curve balls thrown your way, because Chabrol is going to town with this
thriller, twisting and turning at the movement of every Julie sexy
wiggle.</P>
<P>The outcome is a satisfying one, though if you start to think of what
occurred, of relationships changing every reel, of those dead, not being
dead, you might have some doubts about the possibilities of pulling off
all the switches. But by having the police using their power of
deduction to amusingly follow the trail as closely and as delightfully
as they can, it all adds punch to the pulp story, so even if you are
aware that there are a few turn of events that might stretch the
imagination a little too much, that maybe the story did get a little too
cute, as there are too many places where you can cast doubt that the
story would hold up to further scrutiny; nevertheless, it is more fun to
let the story pass as it is, and enjoy it for what it is, as Jeff turns
up alive, and the situation must get resolved again, as Julie is now in
a position to choose between the new Louis, now able to service her
properly, and the dashingly irresistible Jeff.</P>
<P>What an enjoyable film this is ! So much is thrown into the mix, if you
don't like one twist in the story there is another to soon come, as the
cold-hearted bitchy sexpot Julie becomes more important to the men than
the money or their state of well-being. Chabrol even gives the justice
system a well-deserved scolding, saying the reason for the vagaries in
justice existing as it does for women, is because the law was created by
men for men. The film begins in irony and ends in irony, even though
everything about the characters involved has changed. Even the police
seem a little smarter for their effort.</P>
