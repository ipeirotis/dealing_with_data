<P>     Richard Linklater's movies have always been talky affairs, and his 
latest, SUBURBIA, is no exception.  Even though Linklater didn't write 
the script, it's easy to see what attracted him to the project (which 
was adapted by Eric Bogosian from his stage play).  The characters here 
aren't all that different from those in Linklater's previous films, 
SLACKERS, DAZED AND CONFUSED, and BEFORE SUNRISE.  They're post-
adolescent pre-adults stuck in a state of inertia, rendered impotent by 
the lethargy that takes root in the absence of ambition.</P>
<P>     Watching SUBURBIA, I was reminded of the immortal quote from THE 
EMPIRE STRIKES BACK:  "Try not.  Do or do not.  There is no try."  The 
young men and women in Linklater's film seem forever stuck in the "try" 
mode.  They talk about doing something with their lives, make plans for 
the future, but never seem to act on anything.  Nestled in the safe 
suburban neighborhood of Anytown, U.S.A. (actually Burnfield, TX), they 
sit paralyzed on the side of the road while life rushes past at a 
frenzied pace.  SUBURBIA presents an uncompromisingly grim picture of 
the members of a generation so turned off by the realities of "modern 
life" that they would rather waste their existences than join the rat 
race.</P>
<P>     SUBURBIA is about 95% dialogue, some of which is clever, but much 
of which is pointless.  Bogosian has a fondness for meaningless 
profundities -- characters saying things that, on the surface, sound 
deep, but, when you examine them, aren't backed up by much substance.  
In a way, the movie as a whole is like that -- it's somehow not as 
powerful or original as it initially seems to be.  Watching this picture 
can be an exercise in both frustration and fascination.  Frustration, 
because it's difficult to spend two hours in the company of individuals 
whose defining traits are ennui and inadequacy.  Fascination, because, 
even though the storyline is a little too constraining, the characters 
are capable of holding our interest.</P>
<P>     Although SUBURBIA is an ensemble piece, certain individuals have 
more screen time than others.  The lead, if there is one, is Jeff 
(Giovanni Ribisi), a slacker in his late teens who lives in a pup tent 
in his parents' garage, has dropped out of college, and constantly 
questions the meaning of life.  His girlfriend, Sooze (Amie Carey), is a 
performance artist who dreams of going to New York.  His best friends 
are Buff (Steve Zahn), a would-be video maker with a flair for the 
absurd, and Tim (Nicky Katt), a disturbed ex-Air Force grunt who 
returned home after being honorably discharged.  Together, in what has 
become a nightly ritual, these five gather outside a Circle A 
convenience store to drink beer and talk.  They are joined by Bee-Bee 
(Dina Spybey), a shy, pretty blond; Pony (Jayce Bartok), a old high 
school classmate who has become a rock star with a video on MTV; and 
Erica (the omnipresent Parker Posey), Pony's publicist.  Meanwhile, the 
Pakistani owners of the store, Nazeer (Ajay Naidu) and Pakeesa (Samia 
Shoaib), do everything they can to dissuade the loiterers from hanging 
around.</P>
<P>     Aside from a ride in a limo, a rendezvous in an abandoned van, and 
a walk through the woods, SUBURBIA basically stays around the Circle A.  
Perhaps strangely, the film is at its strongest when little is 
happening.  During the second hour, as Bogosian's script begins building 
to a climax of dubious effectiveness, we start to feel manipulated by 
several incidents.  In the beginning, the storyline serves the 
characters; by the end, it's the other way around.</P>
<P>     SUBURBIA's two strongest assets are its acting and its attention to 
detail.  Linklater, as he has done in all three of his previous outings, 
conveys a sense of time and place.  Anyone who has been in or around a 
suburban convenience store that doubles as a teen hangout will 
understand how skillfully the director has captured the setting and how 
ably the actors have adapted to their roles.</P>
<P>     Singling out performers is hard, since all of them are effective, 
but Giovanni Ribisi and Steve Zahn (both of whom appeared in THAT THING 
YOU DO!) give memorable turns.  Ribisi plays the most frustrated of all 
the characters -- a smart, insightful young man who wants to act, but is 
anesthetized by his conviction that he's a victim of life's natural 
unfairness.  For one brief moment, in a drunken stupor, he believes 
himself to be empowered, but events quickly pull him back under.  Zahn's 
Buff, on the other hand, is the kind of character a high school class 
might vote "least likely to succeed," and the actor fully understands 
how to develop this off-the-wall personality without going over-the-top.</P>
<P>     If not for the manipulative ending, SUBURBIA could be viewed as 
more of a character study than a cautionary tale.  Ultimately, however, 
Bogosian and Linklater want to make a point about the fruit that this 
lifestyle will bear.  But, despite missteps along the way and an 
underwhelming final half-hour, the movie has enough compelling moments 
to get us through the rough patches.  SUBURBIA is far from a perfect 
film, but, for viewers who can look past the unevenness, there is value 
in some of what is being said.</P>
