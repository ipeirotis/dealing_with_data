<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This watchable neo-noir tale is all style and not much on substance. The
intense acting and the quirky dialogue, plus the numerous plot twists
and the penetrating character study enable the film to be entertaining
in a nuanced way. It is also interesting to note that the film pays
homage to great mystery writers such as Graham Greene, Ernest Hemingway,
and Malcolm Lowry.</P>
<P>Walter (Eric Roberts) wakes up in a shack in Santiago, Mexico,
disheveled and seemingly on his last legs as he stumbles out along the
dusty streets, rushing to a cantina to get drunk on cerveza. He tells us
that he was engaged to a girl back east who worked in the same office as
he did, but he dumped her and left his useless job because he wants to
be a writer, even if he has never written anything, only sending
imaginary letters to his now jilted girlfriend telling her how sour his
life turned out since leaving her. He has been here for two weeks,
speaking to no one after being robbed. In the bar he is greeted by a
fellow gringo, a stranger called Louis (Jim McManus), who starts making
friendly conversation with him, trying to find out who he is and why he
is here.</P>
<P>Louis tells him that is an epigram writer, and gets Walter to tell him a
fantasy story that he's in Mexico to hide out after killing a man,
thinking that this will impress Louis. Louis then tells him that he is
just the man he is looking for, as he has a rich client whose
16-year-old son was killed by a homosexual rapist, that the killer is a
very wealthy man who got away with the crime. He then offers Walter
$100,000 to kill the rapist murderer.</P>
<P>Walter testily asks him about the one hiring him, and is told he is a
philanthropist, Jose Guerra (Joaquim de Almeida), who donated money to
build a much needed children's hospital in town. Walter seems to be put
off by him, recalling that he sees him in town wearing Armani suits.
Louis responds with an epigram: It is not the clothes but the man's
tears that make the man.</P>
<P>Needing the money, Walter takes the assignment and goes to the so-called
killer's unguarded house, where he suspiciously lives alone. When he
pulls his gun on Humberto (Victor), the unafraid victim says, " If you
were worth the money they paid you, I would be dead five minutes ago, go
ahead--do what you came for.'' When Walter can't kill him and is intent
on listening to his story, Humberto tells him what really happened, how
Jose killed his own son because he was a queer and couldn't live with
that. After getting Walter's attention by telling him he knows Graham
Greene, he wrestles the gun away from him and instead of killing Walter,
he kills himself, saying he is tired of waiting for someone to come and
kill him.</P>
<P>The story then moves along the lines of betrayal and revenge, and we
witness a massive character transformation for Walter, who lies crippled
in a hospital. His self-pity turns to an appreciation of the cockroach
crawling on his face and he imagines himself becoming like the roach,
which he eats, reasoning the roach has always survived since the
beginning of time even if he's useless, and by eating him he is taking
in the same poison that keeps the roach alive.</P>
<P>He will eventually meet the pretty 17-year- old girl Lourdes (Tara
Crespo), who is about to marry Jose. She is the same girl Walter lusts
after from his Peeping Tom experiences. He used to peek into her house
and pine for her in his two week downtrodden binge, and he will meet her
again as part of the twists in the plot and another test for his
approach to life, as he seeks revenge on Jose for double-crossing him.</P>
<P>The film works best as a hard-boiled character study, where Eric Roberts
makes it believable that someone could end up in such an untenable
position as he does, yet survive because he has the instincts for
survival no matter how bad it gets. It is believable that he ran away
from regular life--that he just wanted to test himself, which is the
gloomy beauty of the story, giving it its Kafkaesque feel. It's a story
that doesn't seem to be leading anywhere or have any message to deliver,
and thank goodness for that. It's probably a male oriented film more
than a film for a general audience, a cult film for those who like
offbeat noir films and mystery writers who get drunk and write scripts
that have their flawed protagonist put their ladies on pedestals, only
to delight in watching them fall off those pedestals.</P>
