<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Curtis Hanson has come up with a lovable screwball comedy to direct,
about academia in inclement Pittsburgh, for his follow up to his
successful "L.A. Confidential." It is Adapted by Steve Kloves from
Michael Chabon's 1995 novel. The film works as far as developing the
floundering character of the unstylish middle-aged writing professor,
Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas), who after success with his first novel,
has developed what others on campus think is writer's block. It has been
seven years since he published something new. He cannot finish the
manuscript for his next book - which now numbers more than 2,600
single-spaced typewritten pages.</P>
<P>The film also conveys a cozy feeling for campus life for would-be
writers and for faculty members who live on campus. But it suffers when
its story about an aspiring writer and his faculty adviser begins to
lose any sense of proportion. In the end, it becomes indulgent and ties
things up much too neatly to be taken seriously as drama.</P>
<P>The film revives an old story about the wily writer who is
over-the-hill, no longer a 'wonder boy,' but someone going through the
motions of teaching and writing, only to have a young student, James
Leer (Tobey Maguire), breathe new life into him. It is a familiar story,
but told with great charm here and with sharp observations of how these
academia types talk to each other and interact.</P>
<P>Professor Tripp is in the midst of a hectic weekend: his wife left him;
his mistress, the college chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand),
tells him that she is pregnant by him, and can't decide whether to keep
the pregnancy or not; his flamboyant New York editor, Terry Crabtree
(Robert Downey Jr.), shows up for the college's annual Wordfest literary
event with a tall transvestite date and wants to see Grady's new
unfinished book, as he is desperate to show his New York bosses a hit
novel. The manic editor steals every scene he is in. Tripp's most
talented student is the allusive James Leer, who is both suicidal and a
compulsive liar, who, despite having his work heavily criticized by
fellow students, ends up having his manuscript published by Crabtree and
also has a gay fling with him. Then, there's a dead dog in the
professor's car trunk that belongs to the chancellor's husband, the head
of the English department, Walter (Richard Thomas); and, the professor's
nerves are so shot, that he is constantly smoking  marijuana. A lot went
on during the professor's weekend, a most memorable one for him, as he
went around Pittsburgh with James and Crabtree. But, what he was really
doing, was searching to find out if he found true love and what was
wrong with his writing.</P>
<P>The theme of "Wonder Boys" -- is conventional  -- it is about the
author's self-development. The script is snappy, the actors are pleasing
to behold, the photography, mostly shots of Pittsburgh in the midst of
snow or a torrential downpour, is bleak-- but it interestingly sets the
tone for the film's playful story. The idea for the film was a good one,
but something gets stuck here, preventing the film from taking a chance
and becoming a bold story, one that it could have easily become if it
made that choice and knew what to edit and what to add.</P>
<P>Off campus, Grady Tripp has a young attractive student of his, renting a
room in his house, Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). She is distinguished by
her red cowboy boots which she always wears, the obvious crush she has
on Tripp, and that she is a stereotype for the attractive girl in class
who will try anything to further her career. Here, her attentions are
flirted with but not fulfilled.</P>
<P>Quentin Morewood (Rip Torn) is the popular writer who is a guest of the
college's for the Wordfest. He is known by his friends as Q, who cranks
out books on a regular basis, is rich and famous, and is the envy of
more talented writers who are not as successful as he is.</P>
<P>Also dragged into the story are an interracial couple who add some
slapstick scenes, enlarging the quirky flavor of the film. Oola (Jane
Adams) is a sweet waitress in a bar that the college people frequent.
Her husband, a James Brown look-alike, who is falsely called Vernon
(Knox) by Grady, turns out to be the real owner of the car driven by
Grady. It is taken back by Vernon unceremoniously from in front of
Tripp's house. But Grady returns to the car to retrieve the knapsack
left there by Leer, because it contains the black, fur-collared sweater
that Marilyn Monroe wore when she married Joe DiMaggio, which Leer
impulsively stole from the bedroom vault of Walter's (Walter's a
collector of such memorabilia for his upcoming book), that was the night
Leer shot Walter's blind dog as it was attacking Grady. Those scenes
were amusing in the way those old-fashioned comedies of the 1930s and
1940s were.</P>
<P>The film had a warm and fuzzy feeling to it. It had some good Bob Dylan
tunes in the background. It had a tolerant feeling for odd characters,
potheads, thieves, writing students, gays, interracial couples, and
adulterers. It was a return to liberalism movie, bucking a trend of a
lot of new films to be more conservative or more extreme in their
unconventionality. In any case, it was good to see a film about some
older people with a sense of humor, a bit of romance in them, who are
able to loosen up a bit. This does not make it a great film, but it was
diverting and had a certain sophistication to it that should attract an
older audience, one more perceptive about the advantages of a higher
education. To the film's credit, it keeps its focus on Tripp as someone
who is mixed-up, but who is still trying to be a decent teacher and help
those under his tutelage.</P>
