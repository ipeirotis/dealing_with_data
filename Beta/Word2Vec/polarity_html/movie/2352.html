<PRE>                          IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Daniel Day-Lewis, Peter Postlethwaite, Emma Thompson.
Screenplay:  Jim Sheridan & Terry George.
Director:  Jim Sheridan.</P>
<P>     Any time you put together a ten best list right after the first of
the year, you leave yourself open to potential embarrassment.  There
are usually three or four big Oscar contenders which go unseen outside
Los Angeles and New York until late January, meaning that a ten best
list compiled on January 1st might be notable for its oversights.  IN
THE NAME OF THE FATHER was one of those potential trouble spots, but as
it turns out I still consider my list complete.  Don't misunderstand
me; FATHER is impeccably acted and efficiently directed.  It simply
never gripped me the way it should have.</P>
<P>     IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER is the true story of Gerry Conlon
(Daniel Day-Lewis), a Belfast native and petty thief who finds himself
on the wrong side of the Irish Republican Army in 1974.  At the
suggestion of his father Guiseppe (Peter Postlethwaite), Gerry leaves
Ireland for London.  There he and friend Paul Hill (John Lynch)
discover their timing could not have been worse.  In the middle of an
I.R.A. bombing campaign, Gerry and Paul become scapegoats, arrested
with two other friends and tortured into confessing to the bombing of a
pub in Guildford.  When Guiseppe comes to London to help, he too is
implicated as a conspirator.  The two Conlon's end up sharing a cell,
and eventually sharing a hope that attorney Gareth Peirce (Emma
Thompson) can win them an appeal.</P>
<P>     There are really two stories working in IN THE NAME OF THE
FATHER:  one, the railroading of the "Guildford Four" by the British
government; the other, the developing relationship between Gerry and
Guiseppe while the two are imprisoned.  Each of these stories would
have made a taut and fascinating film, but combined both suffer.  In
particular, the father and son theme never quite clicked.  Director and
co-scripter Jim Sheridan makes some questionable choices in the early
stages of their relationship, the most notable being a lack of insight
into their interaction before their incarceration.  A voiceover
narration as Gerry leaves for London tries to explain emotions best
demonstrated, a flaw later exacerbated in a tirade by Gerry towards
Guiseppe that comes of as overwrought and lacking in necessary
background.  The later scenes, as the two men come to a grudging
understanding, are much better, but they would have been stronger still
with a more carefully crafted backstory.</P>
<P>     The legal story of IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER is clearly secondary,
but it provides most of the film's best moments.  Gerry's interrogation
is well-handled, including disconcerting scenes of police officials
watching the torture in silence.  Perhaps the most effective sequence
is the sentencing of the Guildford Four and several members of Gerry's
extended family, each excessive and unjust sentence punctuated by the
slam of the judge's gavel.  However, with the emphasis on Gerry and
Guiseppe's relationship, the injustice of the situation really doesn't
take hold, and the character of the chief detective on the case, played
by Corin Redgrave, is too pat in his villainy.  As an examination of
the potential for bloodlust in English jurisprudence, Peter Medak's LET
HIM HAVE IT is much more effective, a leaner and more focused story of
a truly criminal proceeding.</P>
<P>     The performances in IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER deliver its greatest
strengths.  Daniel Day-Lewis, building his already impressive and
diverse resume, turns in impressive work as Gerry Conlon.  His
character is not as fully written as it could have been, but Day-Lewis
fills in the cracks with his intensity and attention to detail.  Peter
Postlethwaite, as the physically frail but morally strong Guiseppe, is
a powerful presence, providing a tough counterpoint to the mercurial
Gerry.  Emma Thompson, in an extremely small role, manages to be cool
and determined but little more as Peirce; the script just doesn't ask
much more of her.</P>
<P>     IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER has garnered tremendous critical praise
and a handful of Golden Globe nominations, and while I found it a good
film I wonder if some of the accolades aren't a bit excessive.  With
the exception of Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, IN THE NAME OF THE
FATHER is solid but not spectacular, an example of taking two great
films and turning them into one good one.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 bombings:  7.</PRE>
