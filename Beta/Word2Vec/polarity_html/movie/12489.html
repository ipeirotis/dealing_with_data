<P>     As the date on the calendar prepares to switch from the 1990s to 
the 2000s, society's imponderable fascination with things 20 years past 
begins to shift its focus from the 1970s to the 1980s.  Thus far, most 
of the movies to transport audiences to the Reagan era have been 
characterized by nostalgia, Generation X angst, or sophomoric humor.  
With THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO, independent writer/director Whit Stillman 
chooses to view the early '80s through a lens coated by satire.  There's 
also a social message here about how many of the shallow life-views 
adopted during the period continue to plague our culture today.  While 
disco music has gone and returned, many of the ideals that were around 
at the time of its demise have persisted ever since.</P>
<P>     THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO is very different from any of the other 
late-'70s/early-'80s movies.  Sure, there's the requisite disco 
soundtrack loaded with tunes from Sister Sledge, Donna Summer, and 
others, and there are plenty of scenes featuring oddly-attired young 
people dancing under the flashing light of a strobe, but this film is 
packed with Stillman characters, and, more importantly, Stillman 
dialogue.  Only a handful of working film makers are capable of 
presenting the English language with the artistry and rhythm employed 
here (Tarantino and Mamet come to mind), and the director's approach 
makes apparently-banal conversations come alive.  There's not as much 
dialogue in THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO as there is in either of Stillman's 
previous features, METROPOLITAN and BARCELONA, but what there is, is 
done in his inimitable style.  For example, there are discourses about 
whether yuppies really exist, why VDs aren't all bad, how virginity is 
defined, and whether it's a good idea to follow Shakespeare's maxim, "To 
thine own self be true."  Plus, there's a hilarious deconstruction of 
Disney's LADY AND THE TRAMP, where one character claims the movie's 
function is to "program women to adore jerks."</P>
<P>     THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO opens during "the very early 1980s" in 
Manhattan at a packed disco that is obviously inspired by Studio 54.  
There we meet the two main characters, a pair of recent college 
graduates named Alice (Chloe Sevigny) and Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale), 
who are out for a night of dancing.  Since they're young and attractive, 
they're able to get into the club without having to stand in the ever-
growing line.  Inside, they meet some of the other regulars, including 
Jimmy (MacKenzie Astin), an advertising executive; Josh (Matthew 
Keeslar), an assistant D.A.; and Tom (Robert Sean Leonard), an 
environmental activist.  The club's womanizing manager, Des (Christopher 
Eigeman), is also on hand.  Having just dumped his latest girlfriend by 
telling her he's gay, he is on the prowl for a new catch.</P>
<P>     THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO follows this group as they live pointless 
lives, work at unfulfilling jobs, and spend their nights under the 
club's strobe lights.  There are various romantic pairings, few of which 
amount to anything.  In fact, with the exception of Alice, who has 
principles and ambition, no one in this film is especially likable or 
intelligent.  This is obviously intentional, since it allows Stillman to 
make a cynical, satirical point about what's wrong with society, and how 
certain problems have their roots in the disco culture.  The movie's 
only obvious misstep is a subplot that involves money-laundering and 
seems designed to impel the narrative forward toward a resolution it 
might not otherwise achieve.</P>
<P>     Kate Beckinsale (COLD COMFORT FARM, SHOOTING FISH) is impeccable as 
the bitchy Charlotte.  With a perfect American accent and a demeanor 
that recalls Parker Posey, Beckinsale fashions her character as the 
picture of the shallow, vain party girl.  Chloe Sevigny (PALMETTO) makes 
Alice a warm, sympathetic character in the midst of a soulless world. By 
forging an emotional connection with the audience; Sevigny becomes our 
way into the story.  Stillman regular Christopher Eigeman is 
delightfully self-centered as the callous Des, and Robert Sean Leonard 
plays a seemingly-charming guy who turns out to be a cad.  There are 
also welcome cameos from several cast members of METROPOLITAN and 
BARCELONA.  Their presence helps to fold THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO nicely 
into the director's peculiar universe.</P>
<P>     Stillman may have a message to present, but he does it without 
preaching, and in such a way that the audience has a lot of fun along 
the way.  There's nothing inherently brilliant about the movie or its 
theme, but the combination of sharply-realized dialogue and infectiously 
energetic dance sequences keeps THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO from losing 
steam.  And when the "Love Train" rolls through the New York subway at 
the end of the movie, it's almost impossible to keep from smiling.</P>
