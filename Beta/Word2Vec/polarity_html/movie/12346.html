<P>     When it comes to stories about the Holocaust and Hitler's final 
solution, most movies end with the liberation of the concentration 
camps, allowing the viewer to (wrongfully) assume that the arrival of 
freedom represented the end of the ordeal for those who were imprisoned.  
The truth, as depicted in Francesco Rosi's THE TRUCE, was far more 
complex.  Many of the Jews freed by the Allied advance were a long way 
from home (if they even had a home), and, considering the poor state of 
transportation in Europe at the time, the refugees' journey became an 
arduous exercise in hunger, frustration, and loss.  However, while 
Rosi's film deserves recognition for highlighting a forgotten aspect of 
the Jewish post-Holocaust experience, there are serious flaws in his 
approach.  A far more powerful and better balanced depiction of this 
subject can be found in the 1997 non-fiction effort, THE LONG WAY HOME, 
which captured the Best Documentary Oscar.  </P>
<P>     THE LONG WAY HOME shows the horror and disgust with which the 
rescuers viewed the Holocaust victims.  Allied soldiers recoiled in 
revulsion at what they found behind the walls of Dachau and Auschwitz.  
Yet in THE TRUCE, the men of the Red Army are presented heroically -- 
saviors come to free the mistreated and undertrodden.  This almost-
worshipful attitude occasionally makes THE TRUCE seem more like a piece 
of pro-Soviet propaganda than a legitimate dramatic exploration of what 
happened when the Jews were set free.  </P>
<P>     The film opens with the liberation of Auschwitz in early 1945.  
Among the surviving Jews is Primo Levi (John Turturro), a native of 
Turin who has been awaiting his end in the Polish death camp.  As the 
gates come crashing down, Primo puts the mixed feelings of his fellow 
prisoners into words:  "Face-to-face with freedom, we felt lost."  Soon, 
Primo, along with hundreds of other refugees, is on a long, circuitous 
journey by foot and by train back to his native Italy.  Along the way, 
Primo meets other wanderers, including a larger-than-life Greek (played 
by Rade Serbedzija, of BEFORE THE RAIN and THE SAINT) and a pretty 
Russian nurse (Agnieszka Wagner).  His spirits rise and fall like the 
crash of waves as he remembers the events that led to his internment, 
considers the uncertainty of the future, and dreams of finally reaching 
Turin.  Despair has settled deep in his soul, however, as revealed when 
he makes the statement, "God cannot exist if Auschwitz exists."  And, 
while the movie ends on a positive note, Levi's life did not -- unable 
to cope with what he had experienced, he eventually killed himself.</P>
<P>     While THE TRUCE tells a story that is occasionally compelling and 
disturbing, the film feels like it has been sanitized.  In trying to 
inject some lighthearted humor into a tale that is inherently deeply 
tragic, director Francesco Rosi reduces THE TRUCE to a series of 
loosely-connected, semi-comic episodes.  Inexplicably, supporting 
characters keep turning up at different points on Primo's journey to 
offer support and encouragement.  (Serbedzija's Greek and Wagner's 
Galina both make more than one appearance.)  And, although famine and 
disease are rampant, no one actually dies.  On the whole, Primo's 
journey seems more like a trek through a land of adventure rather than a 
shuffle down the road of despair.  There are inconveniences, but no 
major obstacles, and the great men of the Red Army are always on hand to 
offer aid and support.</P>
<P>     Whenever THE TRUCE works, it does so largely due to the moving, 
introverted performance of John Turturro.  The actor presents Primo as a 
sad, deeply thoughtful man who questions everything around him, 
including why his life was spared when so many others died.  Other than 
Turturro, however, no one in the cast leaves much of an impression.  
Massimo Ghini is okay as Primo's glib friend, but Serbedzija comes 
across as an over-the-top clown and Wagner is never given an opportunity 
to develop her character into anything more substantial than a token 
prostitute with a good heart.  </P>
<P>     THE TRUCE is not an innately bad film, but Rosi makes some ill-
advised choices in the way he chooses to present the story.  Those who 
have not seen THE LONG WAY HOME will probably react more positively to 
this effort than those who have.  When viewed in the light of the 
documentary, THE TRUCE does not fare well.  Not only is the tone off, 
but the narrative seems shallow and erratic.  Turturro's performance 
partly redeems the proceedings, but even he cannot elevate THE TRUCE to 
the high level at which this material deserves to be presented.</P>
