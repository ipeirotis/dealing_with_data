Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella `Dream Story' (Traumnovelle), Frederic
Raphael/Stanley Kubrick ; cinematographer: Larry Smith; cast: Tom Cruise
(Bill Harford), Nicole Kidman (Alice Harford), Sydney Pollack (Victor
Ziegler), Todd Field (Nick Nightingale, Jazz Musician), Thomas Gibson
(Fiancé, Carl), Marie Richardson (Marion), Rade Serbedzija (Milich),

Cummings (desk clerk), Fay Masterson (Sally), Sky Dumont (Sandor
Szavost), Julienne Davis (Mandy), UK-1999)</P>
<P>This is Kubrick's 13th and final film after a 46-year career, having
died in March of this year, ironically just one week after the film was
shot while in seemingly good health and optimistic about the film, all
set to begin a massive publicity campaign for the opening. In any case,
he has accomplished a work of exquisite visual craftsmanship, another
fitting feather in the cap for one of the most original innovators in
cinema today. His sharp photographic images intermingled with some
grainy shots and his never static camera angles (reminiscent of ones
used in his other films) and his use of different shades of light to
transpose his visions from a dream world to reality, give the film a
magical look, capturing and sweeping us into its grand design. It is a
film that unfolds like a dream, whereby it is to be viewed with eyes
wide shut.</P>
<P>The film's opening immediately engages us in its sexuality: the tall,
curvaceous lady peeling off her black dress with her back to us, is
Nicole Kidman, and the next shot fades to darkness, it is as if the
curtain was pulled down on a sex show and we are told that now that we
have seen her lovely ass, the rest is up to our imagination. The show is
over; we can make of it what we want. And to do that, we have to take
this 19th century novel about a wealthy class of Jews living in Vienna
and observe how Kubrick has them now as modern day WASPS living a
sexually debauched lifestyle in New York City.</P>
<P>There is a stimulating dream quality that pervades the entire film and
draws us into the characterization of Dr. Bill Harford (Cruise) and his
stunning wife Alice (Kidman), who once worked in an art gallery before
it closed. The intricate telling of their relationship involves the
dreams they have, a ceremonial orgy he attends, nudity-including his
viewing and kissing of a corpse for a long few moments, a jealous
marital relationship to tweak our morbid curiosity, and an obtuse ending
that should satisfy those who can't accept tidy endings in their films.</P>
<P>Kubrick has made an art film (in the good sense of that term) that
delicately weaves a story of a fashionable New York City doctor and his
stunning wife of 9 years and their sweet seven year old daughter they
both adore. They have hit a speed bump in their marriage, and it is all
because of sexual reasons. Make no mistake about it, sex is their
problem. Kubrick, bless his courage, will stick to this obsessive theme,
not giving an inch of leeway for any other reason, from the alpha to the
omega of the film. And to his credit, it is that intensity that gives
the story fuel to propel itself and work its way into the understanding
we have of the chemistry and dynamics in the relationship the two have.
A picture perfect relationship that is shown to be already not perfect
after the first five minutes of the film.</P>
<P>The couple are off to a swanky party given by Victor Ziegler (Pollack),
who resides in a town house fit for a king. He is some kind of a wealthy
magnate, one of the doctor's patients on Fifth Avenue. Before they
leave, they say all the right goodbyes to their daughter and her
trustworthy babysitter in their opulently decorated condo apartment (the
art work on the wall is from Stanley's wife Christiane and daughter
Katharina Hobbs).</P>
<P>We follow the couple around for a few nights on the town, during the
Christmas season, as they explore their sense of who they are through
their dreams and through the acting out of their fantasies in a very
real way, until all becomes blurred for them, except what it is they can
salvage from their present lives and really need to have in order to
survive. If this couple was not rock solid sure of themselves- he
through his ability to think things through and remain placid in the
face of danger and she through her ability to articulate who she is as a
woman, even when tipsy or high, they could not survive- because a
fragile ego would not get them over the hump they face.</P>
<P>That Cruise is nearly perfect for the part (the only slight negative
thing about his performance was that his constant cell phone action
reminded me too much of the Jerry Maguire character), as he displays a
wide range of emotions and ability, to be a turd and then come back and
be human again, is the kind of acting he hasn't been required to do so
far in his career, but with the wonderful relationship he developed with
Stanley, he is able to understand who he is and be able to be convincing
as a young doctor for the rich and as a dye-in-the-wool materialist,
committed to being a doctor and intelligent enough to see changes in his
life as necessities. It is interesting to note that Stanley's father was
a doctor and the apartment used in the film is a model of his dad's
place.</P>
<P>Working with his real-life wife of seven years was also a marvelous
idea: Kidman, who is perfecto in her role, as the liberated but not
quite liberated woman, who pours poison into the mind of her husband,
and loves him while being afraid of herself and her desires and of the
real world, where she is prey for all the male predators out there ready
to take her to bed as part of their conquest, and is still seen as
someone who is afraid of acting out her sexual fantasies. They play off
each other as they twist their emotions around and in the end they both
get more answers than they wanted. To be right for the couple's parts,
are to be vulnerable and to have it in them to be seen as sympathetic
figures who are locked in a very erotic struggle with their passions;
while, at the same time, to be seen as selfish, craving for their own
desires and fantasies to be fulfilled.</P>
<P>The entire cast is superb.The  main supporting character in the story is
Sydney Pollack, a replacement for the fired Harvey Keitel, and he is
fluid in his role as the unseemly millionaire playboy, who is quite
equipped to play dangerous games with the who's who in the world of the
rich and famous.</P>
<P>Ziegler's Christmas party starts out with the couple lost to themselves,
not knowing any of the other guests present, but the champagne soon gets
to Alice and a Hungarian smoothy comes onto her, hitting on all her pent
up sexual fantasies and by using sweet words arouses her sexual
curiousity. Bill, meantime, is being tempted by two sexually aggressive
models who are leading him around by the arm, with nothing on their mind
but for them to have a threesome. But before anything can materialize,
the doctor is called into Victor's bathroom and asked to revive a naked
hooker slumped in a chair who overdosed after Victor just had sex with
her.</P>
<P>Also at the party is a jazz piano player, Nick Nightingale (Todd), who
went to medical school with Bill but dropped out. When they meet the
next night at the Greenwich Village club he has a gig in, he intrigues
the doctor by telling him he plays blindfolded for a secret gathering
of those who dress up in costumes of masks and cloaks, and where a
mysterious orgy takes place. Bill has just left a patient of his who has
died and his daughter who is soon to be married, who catches him off
guard by passionately kissing and telling him that she loves him, all
this occurring while her father's corpse lies in the same room they are
in and her fiancé is on his way up to the apartment; he also gets
seduced by a prostitute he met on the street who he was willing to pay
$150 for, who takes him to her very modest apartment, but he leaves her
when his wife calls him on his cell phone; but, she has peaked his
sexual appetite and he is still hungry for some pleasure. This reaction
comes after the pivotal moment of the film, the heartfelt conversation
between Bill and Alice when the couple smoke a little pot and loosen up
and bring out in the open the jealousy that is affecting them because of
the party, each trying to pump the other about what is on their mind and
getting more than what they bargained for in return. This scene is sheer
brilliance, one of the best Kubrick has ever done, it is a scene that is
so humanly emotional, something that his naysayers said he could never
do; the acting catches all the nuances of a real and fictious
relationship, something that an inexperienced acting duo could not have
done so effortlessly and made it seem so impactful. Angry with him over
his taking her faithfulness for granted, she has told him that she once
desired another man who only looked at her, and would have gone to bed
with him if he had only asked. Bill has subliminal dreams about this,
picturing her having sex with this navy officer, as he rode around town
in a cab, on streets created in the Pinewood Studio, but cannily
reflecting the eerie atmosphere of Manhattan's changing scenes of the
tawdry Lower East Side, the lively Village, and the exclusive Upper West
Side. What made the streets particularly foreboding was the skillful
manipulation of lights to reflect either a dream or reality world he was
in, with the penetrating brightness of the neon emanating from the clubs
and storefronts making them look like sites from hell.</P>
<P>The persistent doctor with money to spare, finds his way to a Village
costume store to get a costume at a late hour of the night. Sex is
everywhere and in all different styles in this film, here the
14-year-old costume store owner's daughter is caught in the store by her
father having sex with two oddly dressed men, and when reprimanded for
this only comes onto the good doctor, who always seems to be flattered
by such attention.</P>
<P>Gaining admittance to the The Long Island mansion of the orgy by using
the password given to him by his jazz friend, Bill enters a macabre
world of sinister pleasure, that is played less erotically than it is as
a formal costumed ritual, replete with medieval music and choreographed
ritualistic movements. Sexual acts are taking place in all the rooms, as
Bill is warned by one of the masked naked woman that he is in great
danger, that he will be unmasked and harmed if he doesn't leave at once.
When he is questioned about how he got in by the inquistors of this orgy
and can't explain himself he is threatened with being stripped  and
possibly slain, but is saved by the same woman who first warned him to
leave, as her action is one of "redemption," adding some kind of
malevolent religious motif to this already adventurious night out on the
town for Bill.</P>
<P>Back home, Bill awakens his wife from a nightmare, where she is dreaming
of sex with a myriad of different men. This scene is complex and
telling, as it shows the liberation of the couple from their secret
desires, how they manage to come to terms with each other and reach out
for love in a world that is not as perfect as it is dehumanizing, as
they desperately try, for once, to be honest about who they are.</P>
<P>Bill in his search for answers for what happened in the mansion, must
force himself to play sleuth as he tries to track down his missing jazz
friend, but is taken aback by discovering that the woman who saved his
life has died of a drug overdose. He is further surprised that Ziegler
knows that he was at the orgy, as he confides that he had him followed
as a friendly gesture so that he can come to his senses and forget about
it- that he doesn't have an idea who he is starting up with.</P>
<P>The last scene could be out of either The Godfather or Fellini's
Satiyricon, as the mask stripped off Bill at the orgy is mysteriously
lying on the bed next to the sleeping Alice.</P>
<P>The slide down a decadent path for the couple ends mirthfully, but on a
seemingly depersonalized note, as Alice's answer to everything is a
resounding let's f***.</P>
<P>This film has all the earmarks of a masterpiece despite its let down in
certain spots:
Is the Cruise character worth all the fuss over saving? Is Kubrick's
overtly homosexual characterization of a desk clerk gratuitous or
necessary to show that Cruise attracts both men and women to him? It is
probably a film that has to be seen a few times before its
characterizations fully sink in and the power of its story can be fully
appreciated. The obtuse nature of what really happened and the mind
blowing affects of their dreams, are stunningly presented by a master of
his craft- in his re-created purgatory streets of NYC and in how he
magnifies the bathroom used in Ziegler's place out of its usual role of
functionality, as it becomes a labatory where love and death and sex are
equated in the same terms, and morality for the "new age" is achieved
without the usual rectitudes of a religion's right or wrong tenets.</P>
<P>But this also puts the burden on the viewer to come up with their own
answers on these matters, since the dreams that have opened up the
couple's perspectives and driven a wedge between them before they came
to some terms with themselves, has still left them with a rocky road
ahead. The whole societal process of how dehumanized we have all become
is opened up for further speculation, as sex our most intimate response
to love is dehumanized and played out in the need for an orgy. An orgy
the doctor would have gladly broken all his marriage vows for if allowed
to participate in it. This two day whirlwind the couple has might be the
beginning of who knows what, and that is scary, as most people want some
reassurances about their future. People also should know who they are
without identifying themselves with their career, as the doctor always
does.</P>
<P>Kubrick questions what a marriage is, as it is dissected as an
institution based on property rights, and he puts all answers for what
its contract stipulates on the table for further negotiation.</P>
<P>A thinking man's work of art has evolved, and a very splendid film to
end the century on, as well as to end the career of one of our most
distinguished directors. In this film's case, all the hype the film got
did not work against it.</P>
