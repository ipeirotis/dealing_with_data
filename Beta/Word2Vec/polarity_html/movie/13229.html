<P>Movies like Six Days, Seven Nights make me mad because talented people
like Harrison Ford, Anne Heche, and Ivan Reitman put a lot of hard work
in to a script worth about ten cents.  The script was written by Michael
Browning, and he decided that, instead of thinking up new ideas, he'd
rehash a lot of cliches, omit even the slightest bit of character
development, and then throw in drug-dealing pirates to provide for a few
high-level action sequences and explosions.  There are good scripts out
there that high-profile actors can make (see The Truman Show, for
instance).  Six Days, Seven Nights is simply a waste.</P>
<P>Let's see . . . we have to get Harrison Ford and Anne Heche alone on an
island.  So, how do we do that?  Well, we'll make her a feisty magazine
editor, and we'll make him a crusty old pilot.  But wait, she has to
have a fiancée; that can be David Schwimmer.  But wait, if she has a
fiancée, how will she and Harrison Ford crash on the island alone?  I
know!  They'll get to their vacation spot, and then she'll get called
back!  Yessssss!  So, they'll crash on the island, and that will be
funny for about five minutes.  Shucks.</P>
<P>Oh, I've got it!  We'll throw in a distracting subplot in which her
fiancée has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo,
and then he can feel guilty.  Then, when Anne Heche kisses Harrison Ford
(they have to kiss, because otherwise nobody will want to see the
movie), it will be a vindicated action, because her fiancée will already
have cheated on her!  Then, for no obvious reason, they'll accidentally
run into pirates who try to kill them.  Oh, yes!  I feel so good about
this story.  Instead of using characterization to propel the events, it
will be completely random, and yet totally predictable!  Imagine that.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong -- Six Days, Seven Nights is not a boring picture;
Ford and Heche both do a great job.  The sparks fly between them, and so
most of Browning's inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors' sheer
force of talent.   Almost every scene between them has energy that the
performers bring to the screen, and I found myself laughing pretty
hard.  Schwimmer is also funny, and manages to milk all of his scenes
for whatever he can get.  And Reitman, who has made some good films, at
least tries to make things exciting.  Even though the pirate subplot is
profoundly dumb, I was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the
action sequences.</P>
<P>It's just when I start to think about the story that my contempt for
this film surfaces.  The picture feels like it's been hacked to pieces
-- I wouldn't be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been
edited out completely.  The ones that are here are as bad as they come
(I think I let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse
of the pirate ships), and I'd just like to shake the producers by the
shoulders and scream, "Why did you pick this awful script!?"  </P>
<P>The film is outright stupid, but some of the elements are subtly
horrifying.  For instance, take the subplot in which the Schwimmer
character has sex with the bimbo, and then feels really guilty.  This is
a serious problem in real life, but Six Days, Seven Nights reduces any
chance of complexity to a weak plot device:  his actions are what makes
it okay for Heche to kiss Ford.  In a script that lacks even a glimpse
of intelligent subtlety, I find it odd that such a strangely insulting
device ended up in the story.</P>
<P>This is summer movie season, but that doesn't mean our movies have to
be dumb.  1998 so far has been one of the worst years in recent memory
for summer blockbusters.  When I was in line for Six Days, Seven Nights,
I heard the woman in front of me ask for "two tickets to that new
Harrison Ford movie."   Why didn't she know the name of the film?  I
suppose she just didn't care.   What bothers me even more is that the
people who make these big-budget pictures don't realize that their films
are becoming parodies of themselves.  Good actors should sign to good
scripts, and if Hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash, they
least they could do is assume that we'd like to spend our money on a
story worth more than ten cents.</P>
