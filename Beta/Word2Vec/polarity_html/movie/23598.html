<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>How the mighty have fallen! John Frankenheimer was once recognized as a
quality filmmaker capable of making great paranoid thrillers (The
Manchurian Candidate), who has slipped off the precipice of reliability
and is now reduced to making this nonsensical, exploitive actioner, that
has a bleak metallic snowy look to it. It is made as if to bypass movie
houses and go straight to video rentals. It is made from a mindless
script. No director, cinematographer, or actor could have made this into
a credible film (Well! replacing Affleck as the lead couldn't have hurt
in immediately improving it. He didn't fit the part, looking collegian
and clueless throughout the entire film).</P>
<P>The film's only purpose seems to be to come up with as many ludicrous
plot twists as possible and see if any one in the audience can guess how
it will work itself out. The violence is gratuitous and in the last 20
minutes or so, the story proves itself to be an insulting one. The
characters became gradually less and less human as the twists kept
piling up. The shame of this film, is that it was oddly enough
entertaining for long stretches, as it seemed to pass for being a
diverting actioner, until it reached the point of no return in
tolerability.</P>
<P>Reindeer Games is shot in British Colombia but set in Michigan; the
movie is from an original story written by Ehren Kruger (Arlington
Road/Scream 3), about an ex-con being forced into participating in a
casino robbery and having a love affair turn very ugly.</P>
<P>Rudy (Ben Affleck) and Nick (James Frain) are prison cellmates, both
getting out in a couple of days. Rudy was in five years for auto theft
and Nick three years for manslaughter; he killed someone trying to
defend his girlfriend from being attacked. Nick developed a pen pal
relationship with a girl named Ashley (Theron), who will meet him
outside the prison when he gets out. Nick's cell is filled with photos
of his glamorous pen pal and he has talked with Rudy about her for some
time now, even sharing with him the intimate letters she wrote.</P>
<P>A prison fracas develops and a prisoner shanks Nick to death, as Nick
comes to the rescue of Rudy. When Rudy gets out, he sees Ashley waiting
by the prison gates and sees for himself that she is the fine looking
babe he saw photos of, so he decides to tell her that he's Nick. To say
that this film had holes in the script and that everything about the
story could be challenged, goes without saying. Just to show what I
mean, Rudy would have to wonder or at least have some suspicion why
Ashley did not receive by now a photo of Nick and did not visit him in
prison. But things only get more contrived the further along the story
moves, so better to forget all the contrivances to the story and try to
enjoy the film as is, and take this B- film for what it is.</P>
<P>After the couple returns to the motel they rented for another round of
lovemaking, Rudy discovers how dangerous a mistake he made when Ashley's
sinister brother Gabriel (Sinise) and three other armed thugs of his
gunrunning gang show up and beat him for violating his sister. They were
led to believe by Ashley that Rudy used to work in an Indian casino in
rural Michigan--you see, they think Rudy is Nick. Gabriel forces Rudy to
tell him about the casino's security setup, but Rudy, now, says he isn't
Nick, but he then says he is Nick after the gang threatens to kill him
for not being Nick. Gabriel has a confused look at all this indecision,
and keeps deciding whether to kill him or not. This little ploy will go
on for the remainder of the film, as Rudy is sometimes Nick and
sometimes he's just plain Rudy. Though, by being Nick, which is the name
he will use for most of the film, he at least gets to remain alive.</P>
<P>If you think you have seen the main twists, let me warn you, that's just
the beginning of all the surprises. The more of them there are, the less
sense the film seems to make. John Frankenheimer moves the action along
at breakneck speed but the more the characters try explaining the
ever-changing situations, the more ridiculous the explanations become.</P>
<P>The casino robbery on Christmas Eve starts the lowlights of the film, as
the gang, along with Rudy, are disguised as five Santas, and they will
fill the Michigan snow with enough blood to satisfy a blood bank for
years. Then the film tries to pull a complete 360 degree reversal and
end on a note of Christmas cheer, since I think this is supposed to be
some kind of Christmas story. What disturbed me more than anything else
about the film, which includes its senseless violence and its need for
an obligatory nude shot of Theron, was the audacity to try and clean up
the mess it made, by relating the film's finale to the holiday spirit of
giving. It seems to want to spread its desperate gloom over everything
it can touch. The thing this film mostly gave me, was a sense of
astonishment that Frankenheimer, who could still in flashes shoot a
scene that is mesmerizing (the one on the cracked ice with Affleck
jumping into the chilly water to save Theron) and then follow it up with
one that is so dopey (machine-gunning warfare in a casino that looks
like a supermarket), that you wonder what happened to the director in a
career that spanned 44- years. What compelled him to make such a dumb
film as this one!</P>
