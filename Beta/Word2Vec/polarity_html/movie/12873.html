<PRE>Carry on Behind
                  Written by Graeme Huggan

<P>   One of the last entries in the long-running Carry on series, Carry on 
Behind is very similar to Carry on Camping in that it involves a group of 
holidaymakers descending on a 'caravan' site.
   Professors Anna Vrooshka (Elke Sommer) and Roland Crump (Kenneth 
Williams) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site 
owned by Major Leep (Kenneth Connor) so that they can explore the nearby 
Roman settlement remains. Anna has a little trouble understanding english 
and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick:- for instance, when 
Anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan', she means that she 
wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan!
   Arthur Upmore (Bernard Bresslaw) and his wife Linda (Patsy Rowlands) 
take her mother Daphne Barnes (Joan Sims) and her minah bird on holiday 
with them. Mother-in-law jokes prevail. Furthermore, the trouble that Joe 
and Norma Baxter (Ian Lavender and Adrienne Posta) have with their large 
Irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families.
   Fred Ramsden (Windsor Davies) and Ernie Bragg (Jack Douglas) leave 
their wives (Liz Fraser and Patricia Franklin) behind for a fishing 
holiday. However, they have more in mind than fishing when they catch 
sight of two young girls, Sandra (Carol Hawkins) and Carol (Sherrie 
Hewson). 
   The story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological 
professors of the day-to-day running of the camp, the search for the 
minah bid and greyhound, the Major, Fred and Ernie's desperate need of a 
woman, a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park's 
pub, and a shock in store for Daphne.
   The partnership between Sommer and Williams is very effective and 
amusing. This is what binds the movie together. Joan Sims stands out as 
the demanding mother-in-law, Bernard Bresslaw and Patsy Rowlands work 
well together as husband and wife, and Carol Hawkins and Sherrie Hewson 
are a welcome addition to the cast.
   On the other hand, there are low-key performances from Kenneth Connor 
and Peter Butterworth as Barnes the handyman, and there are very poor 
performances by Windsor Davies and Jack Douglas who spend far too much 
time on the screen! 
   Even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are 
getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter Dave Freeman, there are enough 
truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this 
Carry on above many of its predecessors. Although the regular cast is 
depleted, the ones that remain show that they can still make a good Carry 
on film. 
   A relative flop at the cinema, this movie deserves a lot more 
recognition.</P>
<PRE>My rating:- 3.5 out of 5 stars.  </PRE>
