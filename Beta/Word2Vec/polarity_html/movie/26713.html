<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A very obvious melodrama about the relationship of a southern-white
trash mother-daughter. A congenial bonding story, where the lesson the
mother learns is so plain, that when she learns her lesson, it appears
such an insignificant accomplishment, one that any child should have
already known. The story is not the thing here, but the unflappable,
zesty performance Janet McTeer gives, as she becomes absorbed in her
part and plays it with emotional force, carrying this picture for all
its worth.</P>
<P>The females bond on the road, as we see them leave West Virginia after a
battle with mother's current abusive boyfriend and head West to Missouri
to find that the man she dated from high school 10 years ago has become
obese and lives on a broken-down  junkyard type of farm, and so she
takes one look at him and doesn't even get out of the car and continues
heading West, as the two make their way down to a small southern
Californian oceanside town.</P>
<P>The mother always leaves town after a spat. She married at 17, and has
since had four husbands and many boyfriends, all of the belligerent and
possessive kind. She has travelled to different parts of the South to
get away from them, seemingly wandering aimlessly around. The British
actress Janet McTeer gives an earthy performance as the attractive Mary
Jo Walker, someone who always picks the wrong man. The 12-year-old
daughter Ava, is played with adolescent tenderness by Kimberly J. Brown.
She is someone who is disturbed by her mother's behavior, who loves her
mother but is upset with her for only thinking about sex.</P>
<P>Stuck with a broken hose in the middle of the desert, the pair are
rescued by a strapping truck driver, Jack (Gavin O'Connor). He fixes the
hose, flirts with mom, which she reciprocates, while Ava mumbles aloud,
here we go again. When they leave Jack, never expecting to see him
again, they settle in Starlight Beach, California. This conveniently
turns out to be where Jack lives. Mary Jo says it is an act of fate.</P>
<P>Mother and daughter settle into Jack's house, and since Jack is a carbon
copy of every man she has gone out with, we wait for the explosion
between them to occur. Meanwhile Mary Jo gets a clerical job with a
twerpy boss (Pollard), who is also a pervert. She makes friends at the
workplace with another female clerk, and avoids the nice man in her
workplace, Dan (Sanders), who is attracted to her but can't make contact
with her, except as a friend. Ava likes the gentle widower and tries her
best to push them together.</P>
<P>Ava finds that she likes living in this pleasant town, where she gets
the part of Shakespeare's Romeo in the school play. She also kisses her
first boy and feels the first pangs of puppy love.</P>
<P>The predictable fight then comes between the quick-tempered and bossy
Jack and the hard-luck Mary Jo, but this time Ava refuses to run away
from town with her mother. The two move out of Jack's and try to make a
go of it in town, as all indications this is where they will stay for
awhile. Whether Dan is Mr. Right for her, is left up in the air, as one
wonders if she is attracted to him. But, at least, the mother shows
signs that she is getting wearied of abusive relationships and that
maybe her next choice will be a better one.</P>
<P>The immature mother learns from her mature daughter, and this modest
slice of Americana road film, which gets into the lives of real people,
works in a limited way. My problem with the film, is that it didn't
absorb me in its story. I just thought the mother-daughter were likable
and the film was pleasant, but not far-reaching.</P>
