<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An entertaining nonsense film from AIP, directed by the master of the
meaningless, Edward L. Cahn. It is one of those mad scientist in the
jungle movies, that is so bad, that it becomes funny to watch to see
just how bad it is. Tom Conway is Dr. Roland Gerard, living with a
voodoo tribe and talking them into doing a voodoo spell on a native girl
(Davis), while he dons a funny fur hat and injects her with a magic
serum. He does it in the hopes of creating a super-being creature, which
will lead to a super-being race to control the world. He tells the
voodoo leader Chaka, that his subject now has the magic of the two
worlds in her and a more powerful God will be created, who will only
listen to his commands.</P>
<P>There's some savagely inane dialogue, which should add a chuckle or two.
When Doc's younger wife Susan (Mary Ellen Kay) questions what he is
doing in the jungle and why she is kept away from the lab and treated
like a prisoner, he tells her his plans are to bring back to the Western
science world that once laughed at him his secret super-being, which he
will turn loose on them. She says, "You're insane. He replies, "Never
say that again." And with dialogue like that and cheap looking props, as
the film was obviously shot as cheaply as possible in the studio, there
is no reason in the world to take this flick seriously. It makes no
attempt to make things look realistic, and its story doesn't even try to
make sense.</P>
<P>A side story of greed develops. In town, a poisonous couple, properly
suited for each other, befriend Harry West (Norman Willis) who has hired
a guide, by mail, the rugged and stalwart Ted Bronson (Mike Connors), to
take him out to voodoo territory. When the couple spot gold in a voodoo
doll Harry has, Marilyn Blanchard (Marla English), the more aggressive
one, tells her companion Rick (Lance Fuller), that he better get Harry
to take them along with him. When Harry refuses, she gets the help of
the corrupt bartender Marcel (Paul Dubov), and Marilyn kills Harry and
takes his voodoo drawings. When the guide shows up, Rick poses as Harry.
The bartender covers up the murder and is promised a share of the loot
for his help when they return from their treasure hunt in voodoo
territory.</P>
<P>Out in the woods, Doc realizes that Chaka is right, he can't make the
native girl under his spell do what she wouldn't ordinarily do in
regular life. He finds this out when the natives spot the advancing
party of Harry West and she can't kill them. Doc releases the native
girl to go back to her village as Chaka requested, but she runs into
Rick, who attacks her fatally. When her death is discovered by the
tribe, they demand the white person who did it should be killed by a
white person from his party. Marilyn has no trouble killing him. The Doc
is quickly attracted to Marilyn, recognizing that they are birds of the
same feather. She then tells Doc she's after the gold and is willing to
go partners with him. She says, "What's in it for you here, the usual!
Doc replies, "The very unusual."</P>
<P>Doc talks Marilyn into going under the voodoo spell to become a high
priestess and thereby the natives will allow her to walk away with the
gold. Meanwhile Susan is kept a prisoner in the house, only trusting the
servant Bobo to go back in town and get help for her to escape. But
Gandor, the heavy-set guard overhears what Bobo is about to do and puts
a spear in him when he tries to get help.</P>
<P>The voodoo tribe by this time, have had enough of the white people and
decide to sacrifice all of them, including Doc, to their Gods. But Ted
frees himself and Susan, and they escape back to town. Marilyn becomes a
monster (the monster is Paul Blaisdell in the same She Creature suit
from the 1957 film, which is too silly to describe except for the blonde
wig).  He was substituted for Marilyn when she is under the spell.
Marilyn, who came from the slums of Pittsburgh and has known no fear
since she was two years old, is annoyed that Doc fooled her, that the
gold was actually only clay. So she knocks Doc off and chases the
natives away, but still thinking there might be gold, she stumbles
around looking for it and falls into a boiling pit, where she is either
dead or stuck being in that never-dying state Doc put her in.</P>
<P>The funniest line in the film came from the original Harry West, when
being pumped by Marilyn as to what he is doing in the jungle all by
himself, Harry replies, "I'm going into the jungle to bring back a
secret recipe for borscht."There are a couple of more lines like this,
which makes this film childishly watchable. If you can accept the film
on it own low level terms, this studio jungle film might be your
medicine.</P>
