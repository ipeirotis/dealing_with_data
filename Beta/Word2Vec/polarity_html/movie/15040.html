<P>     It's refreshing to see a film about vampires that's actually about
vampires.  Not vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, not vampirism as a
metaphor for drug addiction, not vampirism as a metaphor for persecuted
minority groups, or as a metaphor for anything else -- just blood-suckin',
sun-hatin', butt-kickin' vampires.  JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES is the kind
of slick horror package that's increasingly hard to find:  raucous,
sanguine and almost utterly devoid of sociological sub-text.</P>
<P>     Based on John Steakley's novel _Vampire$_, it incorporates that
oh-so-90s-vogue vocation of vampire hunting into the context of an old
spaghetti Western.  Jack Crow (James Woods) is one of many vampire hunters
on a Vatican-funded mission to eradicate the plague of the undead.  One
night his team is obliterated by Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), the oldest
vampire ever to walk the earth.  Crow and his one surviving associate
Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), accompanied by newly-recruited young priest
Father Guiteau (Tim Guinee), have to find Valek and kill him before he can
locate a mysterious relic which might give him the power to walk in the
daylight.  Add plenty of flying body parts, stark Western vistas and
Carpenter's own twangy Tex-Mex score, and you have a simple, economical
horror yarn.</P>
<P>     It all makes for fine gruesome entertainment, but it should have been
better.  John Carpenter has always been able to incorporate wry, weird
humor into his films -- remember the crawling head in THE THING, or
practically all of BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, for that matter? -- and he
manages again to pull of a few nice bits of black comedy.  Woods, playing
Crow with snarling relish and a serious bad attitude, gets most of the
choice lines, all of which are either unprintable or incredibly offensive
or both.  Carpenter's sense of the horrific usually involves a kind of
self-aware outrageousness, turning his displays of blood-spraying special
effects into absurdist cinematic goofs too purely escapist to get worked
up over.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, VAMPIRES keeps upsetting its delicate balance of humor
and horror by taking frequent detours into mean-spiritedness.  It's one
thing to play with notions of political incorrectness; it's quite another
to get off on it.  The only human female characters in VAMPIRES are
hookers who hang around just long enough to get naked and get turned into
lunchmeat; when Woods really wants to insult someone, a bit of gay-baiting
always fits the bill.  Even if you grant Carpenter and screenwriter Don
Jakoby the slack they seem to be searching for -- it's okay that a woman
is stripped and smacked around because she's a vampire-in-waiting, and
it's okay that a Catholic priest participates in a human sacrifice because
another priest is a stand-up guy -- the tone simply gets nastier than it
needs to be.  Everyone is too unpleasant too often.</P>
<P>     The thing about VAMPIRES is that when Carpenter rolls up his sleeves
and dives into genre action, it's a lot of fun.  In fact, if he had rolled
with the tone of the first 25 minutes, he might have had a minor classic
on his hands.  The opening assault on a New Mexico vampire "nest" is wild,
silly and superbly paced; Valek's first attack is a creepy and crafty
splatter-fest.  From there, VAMPIRES gets progressively more angry and
ominous, before it finally rights itself for the climactic confrontation
between Crow and Valek.  There's not enough interest in characterization
here to make the casual brutality of Crow and Montoya somehow
psychologically appropriate.  Psychology's got virtually nothing to do
with JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES, a slice of Halloween mayhem that works
wonderfully when it lets the good times roll.  For a vampire movie without
a "message," it offers some mixed messages it could do without.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 stake-outs:  6.</PRE>
