<P>     MARTHA AND I, a tale about living in the Sudeten region of 
Czechoslovakia at the dawn of Nazi occupation, is a confused motion 
picture that doesn't know whether it wants to be a coming-of-age story, 
an offbeat romance, or a statement against prejudice.  Although poorly
edited with a jumpy narrative, MARTHA AND I has a number of affecting 
moments, but the film doesn't tell enough of any of its three stories 
for the conclusion, which weaves them together, to have much impact.   </P>
<P>     The movie begins in 1935 in the household of Emil (Vaclav Chalupa), 
a Jewish boy who lives with his mother (the father deserts the family in 
an opening scene).  When some innocent groping with the housemaid comes 
to light, Emil is sent to live with his Uncle Ernst (Michel Piccoli), a 
wealthy gynecologist with sophisticated views on birth control, 
abortion, and the non-exploitation of workers.  Ernst is having marital 
troubles, and after discovering his young Hungarian wife in bed with 
another man, he divorces her and asks his housekeeper, Martha (Marianne 
Saegebrecht, from BAGDAD CAFE) to marry him.  Ernst's four sisters 
object strenuously, seeing the portly, middle-aged German woman as a 
gold-digger.  Martha's brothers, stout supporters of Hitler, are equally 
outraged.  But, defying both sides of the family, the two carry out 
their matrimonial plans, supported only by Emil (who has aged and is now 
played by Ondrej Vetchy). </P>
<P>     MARTHA AND I opens as a coming-of-age drama following the 
adolescent exploits of Emil as he learns about sex, violence, and life.  
These sequences, directed with all the authenticity of someone recalling 
his own childhood, work well, exposing the uncertainties of this 
troubled time through the eyes of a boy.  However, somewhat 
inexplicably, film maker Jiri Weiss shifts not only the focus of the 
story, but the point-of-view as well.  Emil becomes an incidental 
character (barring the epilogue, he's not in the final quarter of the 
film), as the marriage between Ernst and Martha takes center stage. </P>
<P>     What follows is an uneven melding of love (between the married 
couple) and hate (towards them from outside forces).  One of the reasons 
MARTHA AND I often fails to hit the right notes is that it skips around.  
With the exception of the three principals, none of the characters is 
more than half-developed.  Also, while the plight of the Jews under 
Hitler's anti-Semitic onslaught is never trivialized, it is presented in 
an insulated context.  The closest we ever come to seeing a concrete 
example of anti-Jewish feeling is when Ernst is fired from his clinic. </P>
<P>     It's never clear who the "I" is in MARTHA AND I, and that's a 
central problem.  If it's Ernst, why is the first half of the film told 
from Emil's point-of-view, and why is he employed as the narrator?  And 
if it's Emil, why does his character fade into obscurity just when his 
story is really beginning to interest us?  MARTHA AND I might have been 
more successful if developed as two separate films.  In this 
configuration, it never finds the stable tone necessary to draw the 
audience in.  The result is a picture more interesting for its 
historical perspective than for the plight of its characters. </P>
