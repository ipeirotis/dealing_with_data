<P>     Woody Allen is one of the unlikeliest film-makers I can think of to
try to revive the movie musical.  It is true that Allen has made nostalgia
something of his personal fiefdom, and that he clearly loves the old
standards, but that doesn't necessarily make him the best man for the job.
To oversimplify the matter somewhat, the near-total disappearance of the
musical as a cinematic genre has been the product of a less innocent era;
for a musical to work its magic on you, you had to surrender to its
often-absurd optimism, something increasingly difficult to do in a cynical
time.  Woody Allen may not necessarily be a cynic, but he has become
somewhat synonymous with sophistication.  EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU is an
entertaining trifle which never truly transports you because Allen is too
often outside the genre.  This may be the first meta-musical.</P>
<P>     EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU deals with the complicated romantic
entanglements of an upscale extended family.  Teenager DJ (Natasha Lyonne)
narrates the interwoven stories, beginning with her sister Skylar's (Drew
Barrymore) engagement to upstanding young Holden (Edward Norton).  Skylar
and DJ's unlucky-in-love father Joe (Woody Allen) is an author living in
Paris, currently trying to woo a young art historian named Von (Julia
Roberts); Meanwhile, Joe's dyed-in-the-wool liberal ex-wife Steffi (Goldie
Hawn) is remarried to like-minded Bob (Alan Alda), though Bob's son Scott
(Lukas Haas) has become a conservative Republican.  Naturally, all the
relationships have their problems.  Skylar is attracted to a rough ex-con
(Tim Roth), Von is still married (if unhappily) and there may still be a
bit of a spark between Joe and Steffi.</P>
<P>     With so many film-makers content to make the same film over and over,
you have to respect Allen for experimenting constantly with techniques
(the hand-held camera work of HUSBANDS AND WIVES and MANHATTAN MURDER
MYSTERY), narrative devices (the Greek chorus of MIGHTY APHRODITE) and
genres.  EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU is an experiment, to be sure, with most
of the actors singing their own parts and production numbers popping up in
the oddest places.  A couple of the numbers work superbly, notably a
ghostly dance to "Enjoy Yourself (It's Later Than You Think)" which is
reminiscent of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion, but watching this film makes
you realize how long it may have been since you've seen characters break
into song on screen; even though you know it is a musical, it is a bit
startling every time a song begins.  Still, no one embarrasses him or
herself (though Julia Roberts comes close), and the familiar songs are
given unique spins out of their plot-appropriate appearances.</P>
<P>     The problem with EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU isn't the songs, it is
Allen's approach to them.  His audience is notoriously upscale, and he
makes his films decidedly with that audience in mind; how better to 
explain the knowing laughter which accompanies a cameo appearance by
Itzhak Perlman playing violin at a party?  In fact, knowing laughter plays
a significant role in EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.  Allen appears to be
banking not on the songs and dances themselves being entertaining, but on
their silly incongruity being entertaining.  One moment, a light-hearted
duet between Goldie Hawn and Woody Allen on the banks of the Seine,
strikes a perfect low-key tone, but it is a rare exception.  Allen has
made a comedy in which the object of much of the humor is the fact that
people are singing and dancing; he is getting us to laugh _at_ the musical
genre, not with it.</P>
<P>     One of the ironies of that effect is that Allen may also have given a
winking acknowledgment to critics of his romanticized view of New York.
An early sequence finds a panhandler breaking into song, and Allen's
tendency to focus on upper crust Manhattanites is given a nudge as he sets
a scene Le Cirque and a production number at exclusive jeweler Harry
Winston's.  There is plenty to laugh at in EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, from
Skylar's propensity for swallowing engagement rings to one hilarious swipe
at Italians from a Teutonic housekeeper, as well as inspired performances
by Edward Norton (effortlessly charming in his two musical numbers) and
Tim Roth (hilarious as a suspicious criminal thrust into high society).
Curiously, those two performances also emphasize why EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE
YOU isn't better.  They offer a couple of rare moments of unrestrained
glee in a story which feels constrained by its characters' social
positions, even though Allen is all too conscious of the world in which he
has set his story.  It is noteworthy that the Marx Brothers play a
significant role in the film's climax (as well as the title, a tune
prominently featured in HORSE FEATHERS), because EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU
is a musical in the sense that the Marx Brothers' early films were
musicals, where songs serving romantic sub-plots only got in the way of
the real funny material.  It is also set in the posh world the Marxes used
to tear to shreds, only the classy folks are the heroes this time.  Once
upon a time Woody Allen seemed comfortable with Marx-ist ideology, but
perhaps he has mellowed with age.  EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU sings, but it 
might have soared if the guiding sensibility had been Groucho instead of
Margaret Dumont.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 silly love songs:  7.</PRE>
