<P>     THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS, one of the last offerings from 
legendary director Vittorio De Sica (THE BICYCLE THIEF), was an 
international sensation during its original 1971 run.  Winner of the 
Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award and dozens of other accolades, 
FINZI-CONTINIS was recognized as one of the most important imports of 
the early '70s.  Now, for its twenty-fifth anniversary, Sony Pictures 
Classics has remastered the original monaural soundtrack into Dolby 
Stereo, and the film has been cleaned-up and re-issued in a limited 
release.</P>
<P>     FINZI-CONTINIS, a story of anti-Semitism with a different twist, 
opens in Ferrara, Italy during 1938.  Mussolini's brand of Fascism 
already holds the country in a firm grip, and sanctions against the Jews 
are increasing.  Although many believe that the anti-Semitic excesses of 
Nazi Germany will not be repeated in Italy, Jewish freedoms are being 
systematically curtailed to the point where many consider themselves to 
be no better than "third-class citizens."  A recent declaration makes it 
illegal for Jews to marry non-Jews, attend public schools, have a phone 
listing, join the armed forces, or hire Aryan servants.  </P>
<P>     The Finzi-Continis are a powerful, wealthy Jewish family who live a 
cloistered existence on an enclosed, palatial estate in Ferrara.  They 
are by far the most influential people in the region, and, for at least 
a while, their position keeps them relatively safe from the growing tide 
of prejudice.  Mico (Dominique Sanda) and Antonio (Helmut Berger), the 
two adult Finzi-Contini children, have tennis parties for their Jewish 
friends, all of whom have been expelled from the local tennis club.  One 
of the most frequent visitors to these parties is Giorgio Bassani (Lino 
Capolicchio), a middle-class friend of the family.  But, while Giorgio 
is fond of all of the Finzi-Continis, he has a special place in his 
heart for Mico.  Unfortunately for him, his love is not returned.</P>
<P>     THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS, a lyrical, almost-poetic motion 
picture, illustrates the false belief held by some privileged Jewish 
citizens that, if they isolated themselves from the ugliness of the 
political climate, they might be spared its ravages.  Closing one's eyes 
doesn't make the threat any less immediate -- a lesson that the entire 
world learned through World War II.  </P>
<P>     From the beginning, it's clear that Mico's feelings for Giorgio are 
not as shallow as she sometimes pretends.  But she has woven a web of 
denial around herself.  For her, the future, represented by the world 
outside the estate, is fraught with danger and uncertainty, and she 
rejects it.  However, the past, as symbolized by the lands within the 
garden's walls, remains an avenue of peace and safety.  Mico maintains a 
relationship with Giorgio because he recalls childhood memories; to view 
him as a lover would require that she abandon the past for the future, 
which she is unwilling to do.  So she stays on the estate, hiding from 
reality and confounding Giorgio with her rejection of his advances.</P>
<P>     THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS holds its audience at arm's 
length.  As a result, Giorgio's romantic plight, which occupies 
considerable screen time, has a limited emotional impact.  Since we 
never really get close to him, aspects of the movie are less compelling 
than they might otherwise have been.  The film's often-detached 
perspective allows us to focus more clearly on presentation and issues, 
but at the expense of caring about the characters.</P>
<P>     Dominique Sanda, the icy blond beauty who went on to star in 
Bernardo Bertolucci's THE CONFORMIST, leaves a strong impression as 
Mico, whose variable personality (which shifts from coldness to carefree 
vitality) camouflages her fear.  Lino Capolicchio is somewhat less 
successful as Giorgio -- his character never seems complete.  Other cast 
members include Helmut Berger as Mico's homosexual brother, Antonio; 
Romeo Valli as Giorgio's father, who wants to believe that Italian 
Fascism isn't as extreme as the German version; and Fabio Testi as 
Giorgio's friend, Bruno.</P>
<P>     The clearest message delivered by THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS 
is that, no matter how important wealth, prestige, and education are, 
they are no defense against mindless, irrational bigotry.  Although De 
Sica wasn't a Fascist, he lived in Italy during this period and wanted 
to make the film "out of [a sense of] conscience."  And, while THE 
GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS isn't one of the most wrenching Holocaust 
tales, it is one of the most unusual, and highlights another facet of a 
monumental tragedy that features an endless number of faces and angles.</P>
