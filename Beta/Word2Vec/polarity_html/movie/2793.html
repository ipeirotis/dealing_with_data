<PRE>                             SPANKING THE MONKEY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jeremy Davies, Alberta Watson, Benjamin Hendrickson,
Carla Gallo.
Screenplay/Director:  David O. Russell.</P>
<P>     SPANKING THE MONKEY is as difficult to watch as any film this
year.  Let me clarify that--that is not because it is terrible.  On
the contrary, SPANKING THE MONKEY is one of the best films of 1994 to
date.  But it is not a pleasant experience.  It's a blacker- than-pitch
comedy about a particularly dysfunctional family, one in which we are
witnesses to the implosion of the main character's psyche.  What makes
it impossible to look away is a pair of stunning lead performances in a
story as horifically comic as anything concocted by David Lynch.</P>
<P>     Jeremy Davies stars as Raymond Aibelli, a young man looking
forward to a prestigious medical fellowship in Washington following the
completion of his freshman year at M.I.T.  However, there is a detour
along the road to Washington.  His mother (Alberta Watson) has suffered
a compound fracture in her leg, and his father (Benjamin Hendrickson)
is heading off on a long business trip.  This leaves an extremely
reluctant Raymond as the only one available to care for his mother.
It's not an easy task.  Mrs. Aibelli is demanding and depressive, and
takes more than a passing interest in Raymond's sex life.  The tensions
between them build, and the result forces Raymond to drastic action.</P>
<P>     At the center of SPANKING THE MONKEY is the convoluted
relationship between Raymond and his mother, established in intricate
detail by writer/director David O. Russell.  We learn that Mrs. Aibelli
gave up her own dreams of a medical career in a bargain with her
husband, a bargain which allowed Raymond to be born at all.  With her
husband on the road almost constantly, her entire identity has been
connected to Raymond, and with the empty nest has come a profound and
complicated depression.  Alberta Watson navigates this character with
astonishing grace, making her simultaneously pathetic and sympathetic,
a still-beautiful woman facing a mid-life crisis which she can only
seem to resolve in destructive ways.  It is only because Watson allows
us to see Mrs.  Aibelli's deep pain that actions which instinctively
cause the audience to cringe also seem to make a kind of twisted
sense.  To use the comparison which has frequently been made between
SPANKING THE MONKEY and THE GRADUATE, this is Mrs. Robinson the way she
should have been played.</P>
<P>     Jeremy Davies' performance as Raymond is more restrained, but just
as poignant.  There is a lack of back story written in to Russell's
script, but Davies fills in all the blanks with a reading that tells us
that while what we see are extremes, this kind of dysfunction is
nothing new to this family.  From the moment his father tells him that
he is going to have to stay with his mother, it is clear that the
internship is not the main reason he is resistant; there is nowhere he
would less like to be than home.  Davies carries himself in a state of
perpetual tension, a tension which is denied simpler release at every
opportunity, and finally boils over with results that prompt very
nervous laughter.  Davies and Watson deliver two of the best
performances of the year, and give the unpleasant subject matter a
surprising appeal.</P>
<P>     It does at times seem that Russell has expended all his energy on
the complexities of Raymond and his mother.  Mr. Aibelli is something
of a cartoon figure of a traveling salesman, bombastic and
philandering, but a scene in the woods with Raymond cuts through much
of the stereotype.  Raymond's psychobabbling girlfriend Toni (Carla
Gallo) is nicely underplayed, but is too much of a prop; the same is
true of Raymond's busybody aunt.  However there are so many piercingly
insightful moments that these sketchy characters are easier to
tolerate.  One extremely effective scene shows Raymond hanging out with
some old high school acquaintances, guys he clearly didn't like then
and likes even less now.  It's a scene comic in its painful
familiarity, and one more of the many things Russell does right to
highlight how trapped Raymond feels.  SPANKING THE MONKEY deals with
difficult subjects in a brutally honest manner, and will have an
inherently limited audience, but it so daring and well-acted that it is
worth risking the unpleasant taste it may leave in your mouth.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 spanked monkeys:  9.</PRE>
