<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A mindless action film that exploits the current news headlines while it
presents Andy Warhol's dictum that, in the future, everybody will be
famous for 15 minutes, and adds to that its ludicrous plot revolving
around how everyone is enchanted by fame, either wanting to be a
celebrity or to gawk at them. It also presents an annoyingly didactic
message about violence encouraged by the media for ratings and of
criminals getting away with murder because they know how to bend the
rules, as its maddening story only worsens with an incoherent finale.</P>
<P>There is nothing subtle about this heavy-handed thriller. The good part
of the film is its fast-paced street action scenes and the attention
grabbing psychopathic villain (Karel Roden) challenging the
self-absorbed celebrity ace homicide detective (De Niro), which makes
for vulgar entertainment. It's a film that has about 15 minutes of
fervor to it before it gets grounded into a mixture of sleaze, violence,
and heartless melodrama.</P>
<P>Two vile Eastern European émigrés come to America, believing it is the
land of opportunity for everyone, including criminals. The morose Emil
(Karel Roden) is a Czech, with the bulging eyes and simpering grin of a
lunatic. His partner is a creepy, dim-witted Russian, Oleg (Oleg
Taktarov), who is into taking pictures of everything he sees around him
with his mini camera.</P>
<P>Emil will at one point declare: "I love America! No one is responsible
for what they do," after watching a dumb American tabloid TV show (which
is the way most foreigners unfortunately learn about America).</P>
<P>Before they take care of their NYC business, Oleg impulsively steals an
expensive camcorder off a Times Square store and immediately starts
videotaping everything in his sight. The two then go to the apartment of
Emil's partner in an old country robbery, who stashed the money for them
to split while Emil spent time in prison for the crime. When he tells
Emil he spent the money and can only offer Emil a job as a plumber, Emil
picks up his partner's kitchen knife and savagely stabs him to death and
then chokes his wife to death. To conceal the crime, he puts their
bodies together and douses them with gasoline and burns down the
building. The only problem, is that there was a Czech woman in the other
room who witnessed the murders and escaped down the fire escape. Oleg,
who thinks of himself as Frank Capra, got it all on video.</P>
<P>First on the crime scene, is the 55-year-old homicide detective, Eddie
Flemming (Robert De Niro), who tells a popular tabloid TV program,"Top
Story," hosted by sleazy Robert Hawkins (Kelsey Grammer), a business
friend of Eddie's, about his arrests so he can get exclusive footage of
it which enables his show to have top ratings, in return Eddie gets
publicity which has made him into a celebrity, the toast of the grateful
town. Eddie's girlfriend is that program's TV reporter (Melina
Kanakaredes), and they mutually help their careers grow. The only good
thing about this arrangement, is that despite its seamly nature, Eddie
is a dedicated and good cop, and the show does help in catching
criminals. Second on the crime scene is a young fire marshal, Jordy
Warsaw (Edward Burns), who is upset that the publicity hound homicide
detective is stepping on what is supposed to be his crime scene. But
they both conclude there was a double homicide committed before the fire
started, and decide to exchange their takes on the case and work
together.</P>
<P>The eyewitness is an edgy hairdresser Daphne (Vera Farmiga), who is in
this country illegally and therefore afraid to come forward. But Eddie
and Jordy track her down to her workplace salon, where she works as a
hair washer. Meanwhile Emil is also trying to locate her and finds in
his victim's wallet a card to an escort service, whereby he calls for a
Czech prostitute to come over to his hotel. He beats the address out of
where the unfortunate prostitute works before killing her and beats the
detectives to the salon where he threatens the Czech witness not to
squeal or else. The detectives come by and they spot the two thugs in
the street, and the best action sequence in the film takes place, as the
detectives run through the crowded East Side streets chasing the
murderers who escape into Central Park.</P>
<P>The next part of the film is its big surprise, it involves these two
lunatics making a "snuff" film and selling it to Top Story for a million
dollars. Emil figures out that he and Oleg should be captured in Planet
Hollywood, with their sleazy attorney at their side (the real-life Mafia
mouthpiece, Bruce Cutler). The mouthpiece will plead insanity for them
and blame the crime on Emil's abusive childhood and he will move to get
Oleg sent to a mental institution, where he can then claim he's sane and
be released. Oleg's insane plan is to then cash in on his celebrity for
a movie deal knowing that he won't be tried for the crime again because
of double jeopardy.</P>
<P>John Herzfeld ("2 Days in the Valley"), in his second feature, has used
the media for his whipping boy to get out his overstated message about
how slimy they are. Other than the action scenes brilliantly filmed by
Jean Yves Escoffier, the movie is unappealing.</P>
<P>As for the actors: De Niro is playing a part he always does very well,
showing off his comical gift for quirkiness and endowing his character
with a larger than life presentation. Burns is his opposite, a bland
personality, who doesn't watch TV or seek publicity, and the performance
succeeds only in being a bland one, intentional or not. The juiciest
part is reserved for Roden, who makes the most out of being a scary
figure, a sociopath with an unintentionally droll wit. Grammer plays a
cardboard villain, who lives for the ratings which gives him fame and
wealth. He could be any one of a number of tabloid TV slimy hosts,
reminding me most of the ass kissing Geraldo Rivera.</P>
<P>There's not much to this flick, except for the beautiful way its mayhem
was filmed. Its cynical opinion of the media seemed hypocritical, since
this film is just as exploitive and violent as the tabloid TV show it
was railing against for the whole two hours of this film.</P>
