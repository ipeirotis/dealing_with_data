<P>     What happens when you cross The Brothers Grimm with David Lynch, 
and throw in a little Quentin Tarantino for good measure?  The result, 
or something very much like it, can be found in Matthew Bright's 
brilliant, incisive satire, FREEWAY, which updates the children's story 
"Little Red Riding Hood" in new, surprising, and very adult ways.  
Anyone who never appreciated this fable may revise their opinion after 
watching FREEWAY.</P>
<P>     The film works -- and does so manifestly -- because its intentions 
are clearly delineated.  Using black humor, blood, and a pair of 
tremendous performances, FREEWAY hones in on its targets and 
calculatedly skewers them one-by-one.  First up is America's welfare 
system.  Then the judicial system.  Then the penal system.  And, when 
you put all the pieces together, you realize that FREEWAY is making a 
penetrating statement about the general populace's endless fascination 
with the lurid and violent.  And, unlike Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN 
KILLERS, which was torpedoed by interference from the director's ego, 
FREEWAY drives home the point effectively.  This movie is both grimly 
funny and thought-provoking.  </P>
<P>     Reese Witherspoon plays a modern-day, white trash Red Riding Hood 
by the name of Vanessa.  She has what might be termed "domestic 
problems."  Her mother (Amanda Plummer) is a prostitute and her 
stepfather (Michael T. Weiss) is a drug addict.  When the cops bust both 
of them, Vanessa faces another round of foster care.  So, instead, she 
runs off to find her paternal grandmother, who lives in Northern 
California.  Her boyfriend (Bokeem Woodbine) gives her a gun as a going-
away present.  Shortly after she gets on I-5,  her clunker of a car 
breaks down.  A passing motorist by the name of Bob Wolverton (Kiefer 
Sutherland, the wolf -- or Wolverton -- in sheepish clothing) gives her 
a lift.  As they drive north, she starts opening up to him, relating her 
sad life's story.  His intentions are anything but altruistic, however, 
and their little trip leads to a violent off-highway confrontation.  
This critical event takes place well before FREEWAY's halfway point, and 
opens the door for a number of surprising plot developments.</P>
<P>     As incisive as FREEWAY's story is, the film wouldn't be nearly as 
successful without terrific turns by the two leads.  Reese Witherspoon, 
a young actress with a few impressive performances behind her (THE MAN 
IN THE MOON, A FARAWAY PLACE), displays an aptitude for acting naturally 
and believably, no matter how outrageous her circumstances are.  She 
captivates with her nonstop energy, culling our sympathy and enabling us 
to see the world through Vanessa's eyes.  No less effective is Kiefer 
Sutherland, playing a truly creepy villain with a pitch that is perfect 
for this kind of off-kilter motion picture.  There's no doubt that he's 
the big, bad wolf.</P>
<P>     FREEWAY contains several great moments, many of which work equally 
well as social commentary and comedy.  For example, one particular black 
cop (Wolfgang Bodison) is out to get Vanessa until he realizes that her 
boyfriend is black.  Thereafter, he's her staunchest defender.  Then 
there are the supposedly-upright people in this film -- Wolverton, his 
wife (played by Brooke Shields), a prison matron, and others -- all of 
whom hide at least one twisted, dark secret.  This cynical view of human 
nature is what fuels the films of David Lynch and the Coen brothers, and 
it's very much in evidence here in Bright's directorial debut.</P>
<P>     Red Riding Hood references abound, from the opening credits (which 
depict the Grimm story in drawings) and a TV cartoon to one of the 
film's last lines ("what big teeth you have").  In addition to already-
noted differences between the fairy tale and FREEWAY, there's one other 
factor that deserves mentioning.  In this "Little Red Riding Hood", the 
wolf makes one huge mistake -- he picks a girl who certainly doesn't 
need a woodcutter to do her butt-kicking for her.</P>
