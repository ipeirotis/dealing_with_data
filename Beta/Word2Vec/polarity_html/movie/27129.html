<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This made-for-TV thriller provides plenty of mystery. It's a story that
crosses religion and spiritualism with worldly cynicism and murder.
Rosanna Arquette stars as Martha Travis, a medium who travels the rural
South with her widowed, alcoholic father, Walter (Jason Robards),
communicating with the dead for those who buy a ticket to catch her act
in a churchlike setting (gospel choir).</P>
<P>The film opens as the reporter of the small-time newspaper "The Oakville
Bee," Gary Wallace (Tom Hulce), who covered the murder of her father,
tracks Martha down to an unnamed rural Southern town after years of
searching for her. She disappeared after the murder and the locals in
town say since she moved here ten years ago no one has spoken to her,
that she's probably a ghost. Gary goes out to her shack and takes
pictures of her from a distance to confirm that he spotted her to his
editor (this pictures will not be developed with her in them), and the
film goes into a flashback relating what led up to the murder.</P>
<P>In their phony act, Martha dresses up with a cross and white robes and
sits on a throne and tells the believers who flock to their meeting that
everything is perfectly happy in the hereafter, but when she suddenly
develops the gift of doom prophecy, she starts to witness a brutal
killing before it happened. The rainbow visions appear to be black, and
she sinks into despair with the troubled world she sees. Her cynical
father tells her to remember this is only entertainment, but she swears
she really saw the murder. The next day when the murder takes place just
as she said it would, a skeptical young Gary, just making a name for
himself as a reporter, is sent by his editor to interview her and get
the lowdown on what she has seen. Gary goes to the nearby town they are
now appearing at and meets the drunken father and is pounced on sexually
by the man-hungry medium. She is saddened that her father has taken away
her life, that he doesn't believe she can see things in the other world,
and has kept her from having any friends.</P>
<P>We soon learn that the murdered man was going to be a whistle-blower
about safety features at the town's chemical plant, and the boss of the
plant, a hypocritical Christian church goer, Ted Silas (Bennes), hired a
hit man (Joy) from Chicago to kill him. It also shows the Jewish police
chief, Irving Weinberg (Rosenthal), knew about the hit and covered it up
to protect Silas. But when the newspaper ran the story about the medium,
it also ran a series of stories charging the police are not doing enough
to investigate the crime and call for him to start interviewing the
medium. It turns out she knows the name and what the murderer looks like
and tells this to the reporter, thereby putting the pressure on the
police to investigate the crime fully.</P>
<P>The reporter changes his mind and is now convinced that Martha's powers
are real when he checks out who the hit man is. She will also divine a
chemical explosion in the Silas' plant, which will result in the deaths
of those she named while in her act. The film turns into a suspenseful
yarn of the hit man coming after her and killing her father while
possibly killing her, as there is a delicious air of mystery about the
shootings.</P>
<P>Arquette is excellent in an understated performance. Robards brings a
certain sense of tragic power to his role. While under the capable
direction of Mike Hodges (Get Carter), the film is superbly paced and
plays up the ambiguity of the story in a satisfactory manner.
The result is a stimulating film for the intellect and a challenge for
establishing what one's reality is.</P>
