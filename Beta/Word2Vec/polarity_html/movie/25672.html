<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A very long, sweeping historical study, narrated in a first-person
voice-over by Ivan Sonnenschein, the last surviving member of the
hard-pressed family. The film tells about three generations of an
Hungarian Jewish family whose story picks up at the end of the 19th
century and spans most of the 20th. It is the semiautobiographical saga
of the director István Szabó's life, derived from his original story and
co-scripted by American playwright Israel Horovitz, but according to
Szabó, it also includes other stories he heard about other Jews. The
problem with epics of this grand design, is they could never be dramatic
enough and fall prey to episodic incidents to tell their story. That is
the case here, as the story was leaden and didn't seem to move, as it
plodded along linear lines and political regimes, from Monarchy to
Fascist and finally to Communist regimes. The filmmaking, though
well-intentioned and intelligently presented, was just too dull and
uninspiring to sustain interest in the lesson it is trying to teach
about the mess bigotry and politics makes, even if the lesson is an
important one and shouldn't be ignored. The film was also bereft of any
subtlety, its messages were of the kind that hit you over the head with
a loud thud.</P>
<P>The film begins as the beloved local village barkeep in Hungary, with a
secret formula for making his herbal drink, gets killed when his
distillery explodes. His 12-year-old son leaves the small village for
Budapest with his inheritance from his father, a bound book of the
brew's recipes and his father's gold watch. He uses his family name,
Sunshine, to distill the brew and becomes a very wealthy man. He has two
sons, Gustave (Frain) and Ignatz, and when his brother dies, he adopts
their baby girl Valerie (Jennifer Ehle). Education becomes the key for
these children for social acceptance in the liberal dictatorship of
Austria-Hungary, as the fiery Gustave becomes a medical doctor and a
socialist, who opposes the monarchy; Ignatz a lawyer and then a judge,
who is loyal to the monarchy; while Valerie becomes a photographer, who
has no use for politics but cares about the people and their sufferings.</P>
<P>Ralph Fiennes will play three roles: the son Ignatz, who changes the
family's Jewish name to an Hungarian name, Sors, so that he can advance
his career (his brother and sister follow suit); his son Adam, who
converts to Catholicism so he can assimilate and be part of a military
officers' fencing club that doesn't accept Jews, and he thereby gets the
opportunity to become an Olympic gold medal winner for fencing in the
infamous 1936 Berlin games; and, he will also play Adam's son Ivan, who
survives a concentration camp and joins the communists when they rule
Hungary after the war, but becomes disillusioned with the regime after
he has to betray his superior and mentor (Hurt), who is a Jew, and will
be tortured and executed by the communists after they falsely accuse him
of being a Zionist conspirator, when he is actually a true believer in
communism, an idealist. Ivan leaves the Communist party and is jailed
after the failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution, when the West failed to help
his cause.</P>
<P>There are a few scenes that stand out because they were either so
awkward, or because they had a raw power in them that was not found in
the rest of the film. The worst scene was: During the monarchy period,
as Valerie romantically seduces her brother, who is really her cousin.
The drivel that comes out of that dialogue goes something like this: "I
love you...but not like a sister!" He will marry her and have children,
Istvan (Mark Strong) and Adam, which starts the family curse. She will
later divorce him because he has lost all compassionate feelings and has
fallen in love with the monarchy instead of justice.</P>
<P>The middle period drew the most powerful image in the film, when
Hungarian soldiers have rounded up two thousand Jews as prisoners in a
Nazi death camp, and Adam refuses to say he is a Jew to one hateful
soldier, only uttering that he is an Hungarian and gold medal winner,
while the Hungarian soldier strips him and beats him, and then hangs him
in front of his son and the other Jews watching, as they spray water on
him until his body freezes to death. During the Stalinist period, Ivan
advances to become a prosecutor for the secret police in the Communist
Hungarian regime and has an affair with the attractive blonde major,
Deborah Kara Unger, who is married to a communist goon and is so fearful
in this relationship, that even when she's in the woods, getting banged
against a tree, she still furtively looks over her shoulder, which says
more about the police state in those few glances than Szabó has been
able to convey in three hours.</P>
<P>The point being made, in all the belabored efforts of the filmmaker, is
that political regimes, materialism, and all causes are temporary, and
that religions tend to be divisive. What makes life worth living could
be found only in the arts. Valerie (Jean Harris), as the surviving
grandmother and matriarch of the family in the 1960s is the only one in
the family who survived with dignity, the male members Fiennes played,
all lost their souls and lost track of who they were, trying too hard to
fit in where they didn't belong. The film shows how assimilation can't
work, changing your name can't work, being a good family and trying to
be loyal to an oppressive regime can't work, passivity can't work, there
is nothing that the Jew can do to make those who hate him like him.
Valerie's secret recipe is not found in a book, but in the freedom she
has to see the beautiful things in life that are more important than
possessions and honors, and all things that are so fleeting.</P>
<P>I felt drained after seeing this epic, not from joy, but from weariness
of all the messages I was receiving. When a toast was made by the
Sunshine family to bring in the new century, Fiennes proclaims, "Long
live the 20th century!" He goes on to say, "I predict this will be a
century of love, justice and tolerance." Of course, the century was
anything but that, with the two World Wars, the Holocaust, and the
Communist Iron Curtain over Hungary. This was the only irony found in
the film, a film that just couldn't get its complex view across on what
went went wrong for the Jew in the anti-Semitic world of
Austria-Hungary, without being a drudge.</P>
