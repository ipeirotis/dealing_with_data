Review: *** (out of ****)</P>
<P>"Dangerous Beauty" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap
opera set in Venice circa 1583. It is beautifully filmed,
wonderfully acted, and certainly nothing short of entertaining,
but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness. Dealing with
themes of forbidden love, religious intolerance, subordination of
women, sexual freedom, and the roles of pleasure and sin in a
high-cultured society, it still feels like brightly lit fluff.
The director, Marshall Herskovitz, doesn't want to follow the
dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down, so he opts
for a more genial, livelier, and relatively shallow
interpretation.</P>
<P>The film takes place during the Renaissance, a time when Venice
was the pleasure capital of Europe. At this time, Venice was its
own republic, and it thrived on being the central juncture of
East-West commerce. The film is told almost entirely through the
viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of Venice, so we
rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived. However,
there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and
livelihoods of the upper classes, their hedonistic lifestyles and
constant merriment.</P>
<P>The story centers on Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack), a
lower class woman who falls in love with Marco Venier (Rufus
Sewell), the son of wealthy aristocratic parents (Jeroen Krabbé
and Joanna Cassidy). Unfortunately, the culture of that time
period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather, it was
more like a business transaction, where rich families married
their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power,
wealth, and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in. Veronica,
despite her charm and good looks, is certainly an outsider. After
a short love affair, Marco breaks her heart with the news that he
cannot marry her.</P>
<P>However, because she is beautiful and intelligent, Veronica has a
chance to enter Marco's world, albeit not as his wife. She
decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as
well-educated as they were ravishing, and sold their sexuality to
wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the
elite. A courtesan was not a mere prostitute; they were afforded
a special place in society, and they were greatly revered,
respected, and often envied. At one point, a character mentions
that some rulers obtain more political advice from their
courtesans than from their lieutenants.</P>
<P>Veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her
mother, Paola (Jacqueline Bisset), who was once a famed courtesan
herself. Once she enters the lifestyle, Veronica finds that it
suits her quite well. She is allowed to read all the books she
wants, she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry, and
she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic
throwing themselves at her feet, including the awestruck Marco.</P>
<P>Their relationship develops into a playful bantering, with
Veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting
Marco's advances. In many ways, their relationship is sad because
Marco is married to a women he is unable to love, and Veronica is
consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to
love. "Love the love, not the man," as her mother told her.</P>
<P>"Dangerous Beauty," which was based on a factual book by Margaret
Rosenthal, flows along as smoothly and serenely as the Grand
Canal running through the heart of Venice. It has multiple plot
lines -- including Veronica's adversarial relationship with a
court poet (Oliver Platt), her role in obtaining France's
military assistance in Venice's battle against the Turks, and
even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the
Spanish Inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing.</P>
<P>Much of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by
Catherine McCormack in the lead role. Known chiefly for the small
part she played as the lover whose murder raised Mel Gibson's ire
in "Braveheart" (1995), McCormack shows the true gifts and
inarguable talent of a leading lady. She has the kind of
exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a
courtesan; her character is intelligent, witty, and both sensual
and vulnerable, all of which McCormack easily transmits with a
single flash of her eyes.</P>
<P>The rest of the roles are also filled well, including Rufus
Sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in "Dark
City" have assured him a solid place in Hollywood. He has the
same kind of unusual good looks and charm of Ray Liotta, and he
seems perfectly at home in period dramas. Oliver Platt plays a
variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit
like a second skin, although the film deals his character a cheap
blow at the end by having him improbably join the Inquisition and
turn into the bad guy.  Platt is a good actor, but he's just too
hard to hate. Jacqueline Bisset proves that she is every bit as
stirring as she ever was, and even Fred Ward turns up in a small,
but moving performance as Marco's uncle.</P>
<P>"Dangerous Beauty" is Marshall Herskovitz's sophomore directorial
effort, after the overlooked 1993 film "Jack the Bear." Partnered
with Edward Zwick, Herskovitz has spent most of his time as a
producer on television ("thirtysomething," "My So-Called Life")
and in the movies ("Legends of the Fall"). His directing style
can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way
of the story, yet it has no discernible flourish or particular
distinctions. He could have approached the film in any number of
ways, including overdosing on the sexual aspect, which he wisely
avoids. "Dangerous Beauty" contains just enough bare flesh and
ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic, but not so much that
it seems exploitative.</P>
<P>Herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew, including
the luscious photography by Bojan Bazelli, whose previous efforts
include the highly-stylized thriller "Kalifornia" (1993) and Abel
Ferrara's dark sci-fi film "Body Snatchers" (1994). Bazelli
captures the film in strong, bold colors, and be brings
sixteenth-century Venice to life in wide, panoramic shots that
are often enhanced with digital imagery. However, the real
details are found in the production design by Norman Garwood
("Brazil," "The Princess Bride") and the costumes by Gabriella
Pescucci ("The Age of Innocence").</P>
<P>The only problem with "Dangerous Beauty" is that it doesn't stick
with you. It's a good story well-told with interesting
characters, but it's easy to shrug off once you've left the
theater. The only sequence that has the chance to be truly
indelible is Veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of
the Inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her
transgressions, but it never quite comes off because it's simply
too melodramatic and conventional. Herskovitz tries with all his
might to make it a nailbiter, but somehow its outcome is a
foregone conclusion, and like the rest of the film, it carries no
real weight, despite the potential severity of the subject
matter.</P>
