<P>starring Drew Barrymore, Luke Wilson, Jake Busey, Catherine O'Hara
screenplay by Vince Gilligan
directed by Dean Parisot</P>
<P>Note to screenwriters and self: when you hit the big time, and the
studios come knocking for those scripts that are sitting in your
bottom drawer, tell ‘em all to hit the road.  Gilligan wrote the
arbitrarily-titled HOME FRIES ten years ago; it was shelved until he
found success as one of "The took a second look at Gilligan's
"comedy" - they read it again wearing rose-tinted glasses.</P>
<P>Drew stars as Sally, a dim (but sweet), pregnant waitress at a small
town burger joint located somewhere in the Southern United States. The
father of her child is dead, the victim of a severe heart attack
brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons - these
flyboys scared him with their low-flying helicopter. Dorian (Wilson)
and Angus (Busey) were getting even for his philandering ways on
behalf of their anguished mother (O'Hara). Trouble is, Sally picked
up some interference on her drive-thru headset, and Angus worries she
may have heard conversations that took place in the helicopter prior
to the accidental killing. So Dorian goes undercover as a
burger-flipper; before you can say "with cheese" he falls for the
mother-to-be. Too bad Mom and Angus have homicidal plans for Sally.</P>
<P>Does this sound like a movie you want to see?</P>
<P>Without a doubt, the best thing about HOME FRIES is Barrymore; at the
risk of sounding sexist, she's never looked better than here, as a
curly redhead with twinkling eyes. She is winning in a role that
requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple-cheek cute and
gawk at Wilson, her real-life boyfriend. But the plot and the
situations are so off-putting that nothing could save it. This movie
desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the Coen
brothers, but HOME FRIES' brand of laboured hipness would be
foreign to geniuses like Ethan and Joel. It's Raising Arizona
without babies, without charm, without laughs, without human
characters, and without intelligence; worst of all, it's
creepy. What's funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman
with a machine gun? (Unless the woman in question is a Spice Girl.)</P>
<P>Take out the helicopters, the quasi-incestuous relationship between
the mother and her sons (it is absolutely illogical, within the
movie's framework, that Dorian still lives with his mother and
brother), and the scenes of murder (attempted and otherwise), and what
are you left with? The story of a single woman with child who works at
a fast food joint (but dreams of becoming a country singer). That
could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made, but it'd be
better than HOME FRIES.</P>
