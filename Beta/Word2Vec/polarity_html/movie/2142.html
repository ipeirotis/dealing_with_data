<P>     I have a confession to make which may compromise my integrity as a
reviewer (if that isn't an oxymoron):  I wanted THE GOOD SON to be
horrible.  *Really* horrible.  I've grown so tired of Macaulay Culkin's
yelping mug and the highly-publicized power grabs by his manager-dad,
that I wanted him to be wholly responsible for a colossal failure.
Well, THE GOOD SON isn't horrible; it's merely mediocre, which may be
worse.  At least a truly awful thriller can provoke campy laughs.  All
THE GOOD SON provoked in me was boredom.</P>
<P>     THE GOOD SON is the story of Mark (Elijah Wood), a young boy who
has just lost his mother to cancer and is guilt-ridden because he
promised her he wouldn't let her die.  When his father (David Morse) is
forced to leave the country on business soon after Mom's death, Mark is
taken across country to stay with his Uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly)
and Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) in New England.  There Mark soon becomes
fast friends with their son, his cousin Henry (Macaulay Culkin).  All
seems well until Henry begins to pull some rather destructive pranks.
As Mark becomes more and more frightened of Henry, Henry becomes more
and more malevolent, until Mark begins to fear that Henry's
directionless mayhem might be turned on his own family.</P>
<P>     I had very little problem with the basic premises of THE GOOD
SON.  I could accept that a child might be pushed over the edge into
pathological behavior by a trauma (the drowning of Henry's infant
brother); I could accept that parents still in shock over the death of
one child might be completely unwilling to believe that one of their
other children is a creep, even in the face of evidence.  The problems
with THE GOOD SON are almost entirely in the execution.  The film waits
far too long, nearly a third of its running time, before introducing us
to Henry, setting up Mark's guilt and showing off desert scenery.  By
then, it's so late in the game that Henry has to get too crazy too
soon.  There's no time for the menace to build slowly, or for the early
pranks to be tame enough so that Mark could get a bit caught up in them
himself.  Ian McEwan's script seemed to need another draft and earlier
plot points.</P>
<P>     The performances are also a big problem.  Elijah Wood is fine, a
good young actor forced to spend most of this film making his eyes as
wide as possible.  His relatives, however, don't fare as well.  I said
that I accepted the idea of oblivious parents in shock, but Wendy
Crewson and Daniel Hugh Kelly don't play Susan and Wallace as shocked.
We're never specifically told how long it has been since the death of
the other son, and that would have helped.  As it is, Wallace seems
perfectly recovered, while Susan appears simply melancholy, striking
Bronte-esque poses on a seaside promontory.  Consequently, they come
off as ridiculously stupid.  This is also parly the fault of a
performance by Culkin lacking in subtlety.  Instead of the
straightforward tone of a true sociopath, Culkin adopts the wide-eyed,
solemn, sing-song style any parent would instantly recognize as a child
lying.  It's even harder to believe he's able to convince a family
therapist.  To give him his due, he does a decent job of playing the
devilish prankster; that is, after all, what he was in the HOME ALONE
movies.  It's homicidal that he hasn't quite mastered.</P>
<P>     If there's one surprising culprit in THE GOOD SON's failings, it's
director Joseph Ruben.  After THE STEPFATHER and SLEEPING WITH THE
ENEMY, you'd think he'd have the "psychotic extended family" thing down
cold.  But THE GOOD SON goes everywhere you expect it to go, exactly
when you expect it.  It's a competent but cut-and-paste directing job,
providing the minimum recommended allowance of suspense.  I never
groaned out loud, but I never felt any real tension, either.</P>
<P>     THE GOOD SON is not a complete failure.  It's the kind of thriller
where you might jump once, then wonder why you fell for *that* old
bit.  And as reluctant as I am to admit it, Culkin shows that he might
be more than a one-trick pony given a little seasoning.  It just might
be a good idea if his next trick is something original.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 pranks:  5.</PRE>
