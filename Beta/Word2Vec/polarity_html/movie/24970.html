<PRE>A film review by Michael Redman
Copyright 2000 by Michael Redman</PRE>
<P>For many people, procrastination isn't a problem to overcome, it's a
high art. We'll do just about anything to put off a task. When the
deadline for this column nears, it's the only time during the week 
dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and...</P>
<P>Eventually, hopefully, sometimes, there's a breakthrough and we actually
get down to work. Amazingly it's almost always easier than we dreaded
and after finishing, that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away.
And then, the next time, we do it all again.</P>
<P>English professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a master. Seven years
ago, his first book was a hit. He's been working on his second -- a
short 200-page piece -- since then. Fearful that he can't live up to the
first, he can't bring himself to finish it. No writer's block, he's
nearing 3,000 pages with no end in sight.</P>
<P>Now he's having a particularly difficult day. The college's annual
writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding Tripp
that other people are finishing _their_ books. During the first day, his
wife has left him, his married girlfriend informs him she's pregnant and
his agent is in town with a six-foot transvestite in tow.</P>
<P>By the evening, our besieged writer is driving though the snow-covered
streets of Pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him, a stolen
jacket that Marilyn Monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and
a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk. This could be a pivotal point
in his mid-life crisis.</P>
<PRE>And then there's the next morning.</PRE>
<P>There's a lot to like about this movie. There are no huge explosions,
shattering glass or computer-generated dinosaurs to distract from the
very real human issues. Grady is caught up in the curse of people who
accomplish great things early in their career. In the world of "what
have you done for me lately?", he knows his second book has to be better
than his first. Instead of finding out, he drifts, comfortable in the
insular cocoon of academic Peter Panhood.</P>
<P>He doesn't have much of a life and neither does his star pupil James
Leer (Tobey Maguire). James may be suicidal and psychotic. Certainly
everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie. He makes up a past of
working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isn't
interesting enough.</P>
<P>As the weekend progresses, they are both forced to fully engage life.
That's the question they must face: comfort or real experiences?</P>
<P>The film takes some interesting chances. Non-traditional relationships
are presented as matter-of-fact. Extra-marital, gay, interracial,
professor-student: here they aren't judged, merely choices.</P>
<P>The actors are all first-rate. Douglas triumphs, playing against type as
he spends most of his time disheveled, unshaven and clad in a pink
women's house robe. Maguire's disengaged alienation works perfectly
here. Robert Downey Jr. as Grady's agent livens up his scenes.</P>
<P>Director Curtis Hanson ("L.A. Confidential") makes a few missteps. The
women are underused. Frances McDormand does a good job of her limited
role of Sara, Grady's married lover but we never understand much of who
she is. The chemistry between the two of them is non-existent which
makes some of the ending unconvincing.</P>
<P>Katie Holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor, but her
character goes nowhere. We never even see Grady's exiting wife.</P>
<P>This is very much a guy's film. The varied relationships between the men
are much more convincing than any of the others. Grady's alternating
mentoring and rejection of James is the centerpoint of the film, not him
and Sara.</P>
<P>As the boomers age, expect to see more mid-life crisis films to catch
the attention of that demographic. Eventually it'll probably become
cliche, but right now we've got a winner.</P>
<P>I'll finish this in a second. Right now I have to grab some paint. I
noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touch-up.</P>
<P>(Michael Redman has written this column for so long that he's made
mid-life crisis a career choice.)</P>
