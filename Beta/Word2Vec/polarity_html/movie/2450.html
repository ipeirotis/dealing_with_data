<PRE>                         WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Juliette Lewis, Darlene
Cates, Mary Steenburgen.
Screenplay:  Peter Hedges.
Director:  Lasse Hallstrom.</P>
<P>     Tone alone cannot sustain a film, but it can go a long way.  If I
can find myself lost in the time and place of a story, it scores
immediate style points.  When that tone is backed up by an outstanding
story and great acting, the effect can be described best by an
adjective I do not use lightly:  "literary."  WHAT'S EATING GILBERT
GRAPE? is such a film.  It's a rich, memorable and stunningly acted
story of desire colliding with responsibility, staged in a manner which
many viewers might find too prosaic, but which insinuated itself into
my imagination with its confidence.</P>
<P>     Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) is a young man living in rural Endora,
Iowa, facing incredible responsibilities.  As the man of the house
since his father's suicide, Gilbert must support the family by working
at the local grocery store.  He also must watch over his mentally
handicapped brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and help care for his
extremely overweight mother (Darlene Cates).  Gilbert seems destined to
spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in
Endora of Becky (Juliette Lewis), a free spirit passing through with
her grandmother when their truck breaks down.  As he spends time with
Becky, Gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing.
Slowly his resentment builds, until he realizes that he can no longer
live his entire life for other people.</P>
<P>     Director Lasse Hallstrom (MY LIFE AS A DOG) and legendary
cinematographer Sven Nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for
Peter Hedges' screenplay, based on his own novel.  Endora is a town on
the edge of the world represented by the giant FoodMart, a tiny insular
community where everyone knows everyone else.  The midwestern sunsets
and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed, and the atmosphere
of the town is intensely real.  Minor characters, like Crispin Glover
as the town's mortician, are vividly realized, and there are echoes of
THE LAST PICTURE SHOW in Mary Steenburgen's desperately unhappy
housewife.  One of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the
grand opening of a burger franchise, attended by the entire town and
accompanied by the off-key high school band.  Not a single note in the
depiction of Endora rang false.</P>
<P>     The same can be said of the character of Gilbert.  It's testimony
to the precision involved in his creation that he came together
completely with one perfectly placed line, when Becky responds to
Gilbert's description of his father with, "I knew someone like that
once."  Gilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about
where he finds himself in life, a bitterness which reveals itself in
moments of surprising cruelty.  In one scene, he allows local children
to look at his mother through their window, displaying her like a side
show attraction.  His entire life seems to be mocked by Arnie's
repeated chants of, "We're not going anywhere," but instead of
expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer, and it becomes
clear that he is following in his father's footsteps in this regard.
Johnny Depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to Gilbert by
playing everything below the surface, but he never gives in to
one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in
BENNY & JOON and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.</P>
<P>     Depp's performance is overshadowed, however, by Leonardo
DiCaprio's astonishing Oscar-nominated supporting work as Arnie.  He
puts to shame such big name actors as John Malkovich and Dustin
Hoffman, whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely
real.  DiCaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal, and anyone
who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be
hard-pressed to spot a flaw.  Darlene Cates, a first-time actor, brings
real pain to her scenes as Gilbert's tortured mother, and Laura
Harrington and Mary Kate Schellhardt are solid as Gilbert's sisters.
Only Juliette Lewis doesn't quite click, playing a critical role with
her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark.  GILBERT
GRAPE does seem to drift into its conclusion, but it never lost me.
Thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast, this 1993
release proves well worth the wait.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 years in Endora:  9.</PRE>
