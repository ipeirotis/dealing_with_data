FELICIDADES
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>Lucho Bender's FELICIDADES is a comedy with multiple, overlapping 
storylines all set during Christmas Eve in Buenos Aires.  It wants to be 
a heart-warming film, but it comes across flat and relatively humorless.  
The only big laugh at our screening came from the death of a little dog, 
a scene better played for tragedy than comedy.</P>
<P>As the movie opens, a comedian (Carlos Belloso) at a Bat Mitzvah is 
rattling off corny jokes.  He tells his audience that he performed 
plastic surgery on his wife.  He cut up her credit cards.  A very 
untalented comedian, he is particularly proud of his Flipper voice 
impersonations.  He ends up giving a ride to one of the partygoers, and 
they run out of gas in the middle of nowhere.</P>
<P>Another story involves a motor-mouth paraplegic. He cons a reluctant 
Good Samaritan into helping him out, but his helper wants to get back to 
his new find, a beautiful woman named Laura (Silke).  Laura's claim to 
fame is her revealing red dress.  Meanwhile cops are doing some illegal 
ransacking of a criminal's apartment.  As their witnesses, the police 
pull in a guy who's been looking for a toy for his son for Christmas and 
an old man who is in bad health.  (I'm not completely sure why they felt 
that they needed observers.)  And these are only some of the menagerie 
of characters.  </P>
<P>The movie marks time until it ends spectacularly.  All of the characters 
appear in a musical montage set to a rock version of "Silent Night" and 
sung in English.  It is a truly magical moment.  It's too bad that the 
rest of the picture isn't up to this level.</P>
<P>FELICIDADES runs a long 1:40.  The film is in Spanish with English 
subtitles.  It is not rated but would be PG-13 for the animal death 
scene.  The film would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up.</P>
