<P>     Depending on your degree of cinematic acumen, LAST MAN STANDING is
either a) a Prohibition-era remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1961 classic
YOJIMBO; b) a Prohibition-era remake of Sergio Leone's 1964 classic A
FISTFUL OF DOLLARS; c) a Prohibition-era action drama with a completely
original story-line.  New Line is certainly counting on the fact that
there are far more potential viewers in category (c) than in the other two
combined, much as the recent remakes of DIABOLIQUE and THE VANISHING
counted on avoiding such comparisons.  The fact is that there is yet
another way of looking at LAST MAN STANDING, which is as the first film
version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material, the
Dashiell Hammett novel _Red Harvest_.  It also shows that Kurosawa and
Leone knew better what to do with that material than Hammett himself.</P>
<P>     This time around, The Man With No Name is played by Bruce Willis, a
fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the
Texas border town of Jericho one day on his way to Mexico.  By all
appearances, Jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town, with the
few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging
operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border.  One is
headed by an Irishman named Doyle (David Patrick Kelly); the other is run
by Chicago-connected Italian mobster Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg).  Calling
himself John Smith, the man decides that there is money to be made from
the conflict, and hires himself out as an enforcer to Doyle's side.  But
Smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name, and he begins to play the
two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both
of them.</P>
<P>     Viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will
find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint, and
that alone should make LAST MAN STANDING somewhat more respectable than
other recent Hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations.  There is the happily
ineffectual lawman (Bruce Dern), the unhappily detained object of one of
the bosses' affections (Karina Lombard), the barkeep who becomes our
anti-hero's only friend (William Sanderson), suspicious lieutenants
(Christopher Walken and Michael Imperioli) to question the bosses' trust
in Smith, a brutal beating, and a big fire.  Director Walter Hill gives
the proceedings his usual injection of steroids, including a pair of guns
for Willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with
sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity, but at least he doesn't try
to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture.</P>
<P>     What he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake, and that is to provide
a running voice-over narration by Willis which rings of the standard
hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction.  Yes, that narration is full
of cliches, but those are are not particularly troubling.  The problem is
that both YOJIMBO and A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS succeeded largely on the
inscrutability of their lead characters.  They were a mystery, to the
other characters in the film and to the audience, their motives never
entirely clear even after they have acted, and that quality contributed to
their almost mythical status.  With John Smith's voice chattering on in
the background and allowing us into his every thought, he becomes more
mundane, just another tough guy trying to stay alive.  It feels like a
Hammett novel, all right, and Hill can plead faithfulness to his text for
his choice, but it simply doesn't work.  The narration allows The Man With
No Name to take us into his confidence, and The Man With No Name takes _no
one_ into his confidence.</P>
<P>     Even if you walk into LAST MAN STANDING as a blank slate, I can't
imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction.  Willis
tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn Smith, but there is still a
level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than
everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else.  Christopher Walken
plays Doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of
soft-spoken psychos, and there isn't another single character whom makes
even the slightest impression.  With no compelling antagonist for Smith,
there is no build-up towards the expected showdown, and when it does come,
that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about.
Cinematographer Lloyd Ahern (who also did the only noteworthy work on
Hill's 1995 flop WILD BILL) creates some nifty sunburned vistas, but his
work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and
the next bit of counter-productive narration.  Sometimes when someone sees
a lackluster remake of a revered original, they'll wonder what all the
talk was about.  In the case of LAST MAN STANDING, it is those who know
the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about.</P>
