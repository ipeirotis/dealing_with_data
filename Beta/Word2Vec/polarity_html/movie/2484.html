<P>"BELLE EPOQUE is the story of Paradise:  too good to last.  It's about
the discovery of life, but the real one, I mean: freedom, art, love,
sex, friendship ... all the things that make life interesting.  It's an
oasis ...  Maybe it's too idealistic, but I always thought one of the
reasons for cinema was to give pleasure and happiness to the audience.
I don't want to make people think about how miserable life is.  I
prefer to leave that for tomorrow.  I like to hear the audience
laughing in a dark theater.  That's the best music for me."
          - Fernando Trueba, director/producer of BELLE EPOQUE </P>
<P>     BELLE EPOQUE, the winner of nine Goyas (Spanish Oscars), is a
charming motion picture that requires only enough thought and
concentration to read the subtitles.  As a diversion, the film is
fabulous.  How it managed to win the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar
(especially over a contender like FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE) is another
matter altogether.</P>
<P>     It is 1931.  Spain and the country's monarchy is facing its final
days.  During this time of confusion and conflicting loyalties,
Fernando (Jorge Sanz), whose allegiance is to the republic, deserts
from the army and goes on the run into the Spanish countryside.  There,
he meets Manolo (Fernando Fernan Gomez), a painter who shares his
political beliefs.  The two quickly become friends and Fernando spends
a night at the older man's house, listening to his stories and cooking
for him.  Then, in the morning when Fernando is to leave, Manolo's four
young, beautiful daughters--Luz (Penelope Cruz), Rocio (Maribel Verdu),
Violeta (Ariadna Gil), and Clara (Miriam Diaz-Aroca)--arrive.  Fernando
takes one look at them and decides to prolong his stay with Manolo for
a while longer.</P>
<P>     Some of issues presented by the tumultuous political climate and
the churning waters of religious uncertainty keep BELLE EPOQUE from
being a completely brainless endeavor.  Nevertheless, anything serious
is kept strictly in the background, and even the most dismal scenes are
presented with enough playfulness to avoid betraying the giddy tone.</P>
<P>     With a minimum of nudity, BELLE EPOQUE demonstrates that the
blatant displays of flesh from something like SIRENS are unnecessary to
set an atmosphere of sensuality.  This is a steamy motion picture with
its share of bed-hopping and partner-swapping.  Penelope Cruz (who
revealed a lot more in JAMON, JAMON) alone is enough to make the screen
sizzle.</P>
<P>     All six major characters are nicely-developed and well-portrayed.
Despite the numerous sexual trysts he engages in, Fernando is still
something of an innocent, and Jorge Sanz plays him to wide-eyed
perfection.  The most complex character of all is Manolo, who is based
on a real-life acquaintance of producer/director Fernando Trueba.  The
character's own words describe him best:  "I am a rebel, an infidel,
and a libertine by nature, living life like a scared old bourgeois."</P>
<P>     Each of Manolo's four daughters is different.  Rocio is the
playful and glamorous one, who in turn fights off and embraces the
advances of a clumsy suitor.  Violeta is a tomboy, who dresses as a man
and won't consider sex until her partner is dressed as a woman.  Clara
is a widow desperately yearning for companionship.  And Luz is a
virgin, annoyed that she's not always privy to her older sisters'
confidences.</P>
<P>     Very little of the humor in BELLE EPOQUE is especially
high-brow--in fact, much of it is quite earthy.  More important than
the nature of the comedy, however, is that it successfully provokes
laughter.  As was the intention of Fernando Trueba when he crafted the
film, the ultimate reaction of the audience is to smile.  Despite the
subtitles, this is less art than it is fun.  BELLE EPOQUE is an
enchanting, unpretentious, two-hour vacation from the rigors of real
life.</P>
