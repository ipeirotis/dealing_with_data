<PRE>starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Heather Graham, Christine
Baranski
screenplay by Steve Martin
directed by Frank Oz</PRE>
<P>Steve Martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking
a few years back; he spent this time writing essays and short stories
for "The New Yorker," several of which wound up in his hilarious
hardback compilation, Pure Drivel (1998). Much of the book spares
tinseltown from mockery, although he does riff on the racist comments
made by Marlon Brando during a Larry King interview, in a fine chapter
called "In Search of the Wily Filipino." Now, as writer and star of
Bowfinger, he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a
career in the cinema, perhaps finally venting the frustrations
('everything being made now is crap') that led to his brief retirement
from Hollywood.</P>
<P>Martin stars as Bobby Bowfinger, a Roger Corman-wannabe on the cusp of
fifty and desperate for some success as a producer, quality of the
projects be damned. His accountant (Adam Alexi-Malle) proposes a movie
called "Chubby Rain," about aliens who travel to Earth in raindrops
slightly fatter than regular raindrops. Bowfinger latches onto the
idea immediately, and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear
in the film, based on the lie that America's top box office draw, Kit
Ramsey (Murphy), has agreed to star.</P>
<P>Ramsey, of course, wants nothing to do with such low-grade material,
so Bowfinger, on the thinking that action stars need to run, not
speak, decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously. He sends
his cast members (who aren't in on it, either; they are told Ramsey
hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars) to
Ramsey's table at restaurants, asks them to follow him in parking
lots, etc., spouting script dialogue, all the while shooting the
outcome from a great distance. The paranoid Ramsey flees the scene
nearly every time.</P>
<P>Ramsey is a member of Mind Head, a cultish self-help organization
apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities. (As if that's not
familiar enough, Mind Head guru Terry Stricter (Terence Stamp) has
been dressed and combed to resemble L. Ron Hubbard, founder of
Scientology.) When he goes to Mind Head with tales of caucasian
strangers appearing from nowhere to babble "white code" in his face,
they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him
off to a retreat, requiring Bowfinger to find a stand-in.</P>
<P>Murphy will probably win more fans as Jiff, Ramsey's adorable,
ignoramus double, than as Kit, but it is his portrayal of the latter
that took courage. Always surrounded by an entourage, suffering from a
racial inferiority complex, Murphy plays right into the tabloid image
of himself. Furthermore, consider the enemies he'll make of popular
Scientologists. Pacing Stricter's neutral-coloured office as if on an
amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer, Ramsey is asked
to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly. Murphy's scenes with
Stamp are exactly what I imagine of a John Travolta "clearing."</P>
<P>Not that Murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick; Bowfinger is
Steve Martin's invention. His script is surprisingly clever as satire,
given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck, as is the entire Los
Angeles film industry. (The Griffin Mill-types take quite a beating,
in the form of Robert Downey Jr. as bigwig Jerry Renfro.) Martin's
decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder's point of view is
what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a
group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture. As
expected, there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs, such as
Martin's crew of Mexican border-jumpers, who gain unexpected
appreciation for the classics from reading "Cahiers Du Cinema," or
Martin's nonsensical explanation to Dave, his loyal cinematographer
(Jamie Kennedy), that every movie, in the end, has a budget of
two-thousand dollars (!). Most of Bowfinger is universally funny,
however; I defy any viewer to keep a straight face when Christine
Baranski, one of our brightest comediennes, is on screen.</P>
<P>Bowfinger's main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial
aftermath. We're also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of
Kit Ramsey would redeem "Chubby Rain," Z-grade entertainment that
would make Ed Wood blush. (This aspect of Bowfinger has much in common
with the ludicrous Oscar sequence in Oz's last directorial effort, the
poorly conceived In & Out.) These are significant enough weaknesses
that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece.</P>
<P>As I mentioned at the start of this review, Bowfinger offers solid
reasons not to do what Heather Graham's character Daisy does: hop a
bus to Hollywood in search of stardom. That said, it offers one
fantastic reason to get on that bus: the sense of community between
filmmakers who gel is awesome. Martin gets sentimental by story's end
as he did in L.A. Story, and how could he not? For those who can hack
it, the movies might be the greatest business in the world.</P>
