<PRE>                                MR. WONDERFUL
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Matt Dillon, Annabella Sciorra, Mary-Louise Parker,
           William Hurt.
Screenplay:  Amy Schor & Vicki Polon.
Director:  Anthony Minghella.</P>
<P>     Sometimes, it's all about state of mind.  Either you're ready to
enjoy a certain kind of movie, or you're not.  I can envision a
different set of circumstances under which I might have walked away
from MR. WONDERFUL with eyes rolling and a groan of "Puh-leez."  But I
didn't.  Instead, I found it to be a warm and charming lightweight
romance, full of appealing performances and well-directed moments of
tiny heartbreak.</P>
<P>     MR. WONDERFUL is the story of divorced couple New York couple Gus
and Lee DiMarco.  Gus (Matt Dillon) is a nice-but-simple Con Edison
worker; Lee (Annabella Sciorra) has left him in an attempt to break
free of "the neighborhood" and get a college education.  Gus has since
hooked up with Rita (Mary-Louise Parker), a nurse who wants to move in
with Gus, while Lee is seeing Tom (William Hurt), her married English
professor.  Gus wants to go in with his buddies on reopening a local
bowling alley, but can't afford it thanks to the cost of his alimony
payments.  The buddies suggest that Gus try to find Lee a husband so
that he can be freed of his financial obligations.  A reluctant Gus
than sets Lee up with a series of acquaintances, all the while
wondering whether or not he might really be her Mr. Wonderful.</P>
<P>     Nothing about that premise screams originality.  Feuding exes who
still carry a torch have been fodder for most daytime and nighttime
soaps for ever.  The relative success of MR. WONDERFUL is attributable
almost entirely to the cast.  Dillon is an extremely likable lug;
Sciorra has the tense charm of a woman just discovering herself.  Their
scenes together work to perfection because they manage to be thoroughly
convincing as two people who have know each other, as Lee notes,
"practically since I was born."  They shift naturally between civil
conversation and petty bickering, creating a genuine sense of history
between them, and it's extremely entertaining to watch.  Particularly
affecting is a scene where Gus and Lee prepare to go out to dinner by
lowering the roof on Gus's convertible, performing a multi-step ritual
without thinking until Lee bigins to cry with the memory of better
times.  It was the frequency of moments like that one which ultimately
won me over to caring about these characters.  Equally delightful is
Mary-Louise Parker, who gives her underdeveloped role as Gus's nervous
girlfriend a beautiful soul.  Parker has one of the most expressive
mouths in films, and she uses it to show more different shades of
emotion than she has lines.  I also enjoyed David Barry Gray, who has
an endearing puppy-dog energy about him as Gus's best friend Pope.</P>
<P>     This is not to say that all of the characters worked all the
time.  I was quickly distracted by William Hurt's twitchy professor,
who doesn't seem to have an identifiable personality.  Vincent
D'Onofrio only gets three scenes to develop what ends up being a rather
important character, and consequently seems to try a bit too hard to
make Dominic angelic.  And yes, Dillon does have some overplayed
moments, making Gus's "hidden emotions" far too obvious for anyone with
half a brain, or even a notochord.  Compare his reactions to Parker's
at a hospital fundraiser where Lee appears with another man, just as an
example of what not to do.</P>
<P>     Director Anthony Minghella, who gave us the low-key supernatural
romance TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY, seems to have a knack for finding slices
of real emotion without resorting to schmaltz.  I was genuinely touched
by a small moment involving a woman waiting for a blind date from a
personals ad, as well as a brief conversation between Rita and Lee.
However, these same moments also made me wonder whether MR. WONDERFUL
had missed an opportunity to be a more wide-ranging examination of
everyone's search for a Mr. or Mr.  Wonderful, and what people are
willing to do or give up for that chance.  As it stands, the focus on
the specific still held my attention.  MR. WONDERFUL is no work of art,
but it's gentle and affirming and it caught me on a good day.  Kindly
check in your cynicism at the door.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 blind dates:  6.</PRE>
