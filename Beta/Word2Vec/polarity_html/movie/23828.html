<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An MGM dazzler, a striking musical, satirizing the staging of a Broadway
play. It is a technically superior work, making up for a thin plot with
plenty of lively musical scores and dance numbers, and a constant
barrage of witty dialogue. Many critics consider this one to be the best
musical of all time. The musical becomes the stage for the battle
between pop culture versus high art, with the film favoring the low brow
art form.</P>
<P>The British musical star Jack Buchanan, plays a flamboyant,
self-absorbed producer/director Jeffrey Cordova, supposedly imitating
Jose Ferrer; the married scenarists, a sometimes bickering couple, Lily
Marton (Nanette Fabray) and Lester (Oscar Levant), supposedly are
autobiographical of the film's scenarists Betty Comden and Adolph Green.
Fred Astaire plays Tony Hunter, a has-been Hollywood musical star, who
comes to New York to try and revive his dying career, which is close
enough in reality to what was happening to Astaire at the the time of
this film. His career had gone downhill from his peak days, not having
made a successful film in the past three years. Clifton Webb was
first-choice for the Buchanan part, but he turned it down because it
wasn't a starring role. However, he did recommend Buchanan to the studio
for the part, and the studio was rewarded in its choice by getting an
outstanding performance from him.</P>
<P>This is a film dominated by its magnificent musical numbers scored by
Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz. The songs include the following: 'A
Shine on your Shoes,' 'Dancing in the Dark,' 'That's Entertainment,' 'By
Myself,' my favorite number about triplets who do not like each other-
'Triplets,' 'New Sun in the Sky,' 'I guess I'll Have to Change My Plans-
the highlight of this number is a soft-shoe by Astaire and Buchanan,'
'Louisiana Hayride,' 'I love Louisa,' and an eight-minute dream number
that is the climax of the film-- a jazz-dance spoof on Mickey Spillane's
'Girl Hunt,' with Cyd showing off her long dancing legs as a femme
fatale in a smoky barroom and delivering a very sexy routine in a
sequined red dress and black mesh tights. Astaire is the noir-like
detective, wearing a cream-colored suit, a black shirt and yellow tie
and is dancing to a sexually-charged choreographed stage fighting
scenario. This Technicolor dance routine didn't seem to fit into the
rest of the film, except it seemed to point out what the film was trying
to say about mixing together both art forms, as the dance was both
derived from the lexicon of pop culture and from the high arts.</P>
<P>The Marton scenarists write a Broadway show for Tony Hunter and get the
pretentious Jeffrey Cordova to direct it. He changes their lighthearted
pop musical into a serious play about a modern Faust and gets backers
immediately for the show because of his recent hits on Broadway. He also
gets Paul Byrd (Mitchell) to choreograph the show, with the idea that he
can get his star ballerina girlfriend, Gaby Gerard (Cyd), to do his
Broadway show. She is a hot commodity, but has turned down all offers of
Broadway, prefering the aesthetics of the more serious medium she is in.
Cordova is an excellent manipulator of people and is thereby able to get
the cast he wants.</P>
<P>But there is no smooth sailing ahead, as Hunter feels he is being frozen
out of the show, realizing that he can't do serious dancing on a par
with Gaby, while Gaby feels she can't do his hoofer style of dancing.
They both feel inferior when not doing the role they feel comfortable in
and try to see if they can work out a satisfactory way in which to be
dance partners. He is also vainly worried that she is too tall for him.</P>
<P>The Martons are disappointed that the director has ignored their script.
Lester wants his original script to be the play, while Lily swears by
Cordova's track record for success, until she realizes that the play is
not working.</P>
<P>At a tryout for the show in New Haven, before going to Broadway, the
backers find it to be a bomb and withdraw their financial support. But
Hunter, by this time is nice and cozy with Gaby, decides to back the
show by selling his original Degas painting and other classical
paintings from his collection, cavalierly stating: "Those painters loved
the
theater." He converts the play back to the Marton's fluffy original
script. Gaby, thereby, leaves her domineering boyfriend and finds love
with Hunter. Cordova graciously accepts Hunter as the director of the
show, after apologizing for his mistake. It all ends on a happily banal
note, as they sing 'That's Entertainment,' signifying that whether it's
a play by Shakespeare or Bojangles dancing, you still have to entertain
an audience. The Arthur Freed production team, true to the film's theme,
have created a most entertaining film. Vincent Minnelli's direction was
accomplished with much style and panache. If you like an old-fashioned
Broadway musical, you can't go wrong with this one.</P>
