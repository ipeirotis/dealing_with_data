SWINGERS (director: Doug Liman; cast: (Mike) Jon Favreau, (Trent) Vince
Vaughn, (Rob) Ron Livingston, (Sue) Patrick Van Horn, (Charles) Alex
Desert, Heather Graham, Deena Martin, Katherine Kendall, Brooke Langton,
1996)</P>
<P>An independent film, shot for around $250,000, that lacks a cutting
edge, something indie films should not leave home without. It sure looks
like a Hollywood studio film to me, but with a little bit of spice
thrown in to give it some oomph. It is a story about swingers, which
should be a revolting topic and is, for most of the film, nevertheless,
there is humor to be found. The boys are out to have some fun, all
wrapped up in their libidos, ready to score with the opposite sex. The
gang is made up of actors looking for work, coming to Hollywood to be
where the action is. The star of the film, is the one who wrote the
screenplay, Jon Favreau (Mike), who plays this whiny, ex-New Yorker, who
wants to be a stand-up comedian but is the only one of his swinger
friends who is not funny, he is, instead, disconsolate because he left
his "honey" 6 months ago to be in LaLa land, jump-starting his comic
career. He now feels lost without her, finding every other chick he
meets to be no match for her. Unfortunately, we have to hear this
whining for most of the film, until he acts natural, and bingo,
something good happens to this dude, who I must fess up and say, I felt
nothing at all for.</P>
<P>That girls are attracted to the swingers, speaks volumes for how sex and
love are intertwined in our culture. And the boys will be boys theme is
played here to the hilt, as sex is always foremost on their mind. For
Mike, it has to be both, sex and love. That he is clearly the winner at
the end, gives the film the right perspective it needs, not to fall into
its own cool lingo trap.</P>
<P>Preoccupied with himself, Mike always thinks he is being sensitive, even
when telling the girls he means it when he says how much he misses his
"babe," so naturally, he fails to attract their interest. In contrast,
the swingers that make up his group, roam Las Vegas, the bars of L.A.,
and the home parties they get invited to with a steel will for scoring
as many chicks as they can.</P>
<P>Mike's best pal is Trent (Vince). He sets the tone for the boys.
Encouraging them when they are down, but he is caught in his own
deceits, vainly thinking he can pick-up any girl he wants. He represents
the heart and soul of the swingers and gives the film a comedic tone,
that at times, as silly as it is, is downright funny. I loved his
philosophical advice to Mike, from one swinger to another, advising him
that you cannot get a woman to come back unless you're willing to forget
her, after which, of course, you don't care if she comes back. It is
also riotous to hear the loud mouth Trent, call Mike, "money" every time
he wants to cheer his pal up. The other swingers are, Rob (Ron
Livingston), Sue (Patrick Van Horn, yes, Sue is a boy), and Charles
(Alex Desert), who act to support each other, looking out for Mike in
particular, thinking he desperately needs to get his head together in
order to be back with them swinging.</P>
<P>What irked me most about the film, was how the filmmakers seemed proud
that they ripped off  Tarantino's style of film, claiming everyone rips
off everyone else. The problem with that logic, is that this film
doesn't look original, it looks and feels like all those other Tarantino
clones. It smacks of wannabe actors being made into a film by wannabe
directors and writers.</P>
<P>If you have a strong stomach and can take the staleness of the story,
you might find it funny enough, and actually enjoy it, realizing, in all
seriousness, that this is the way it is for many heterosexuals, and it
is always hard to change the way it is, no pun intended.</P>
