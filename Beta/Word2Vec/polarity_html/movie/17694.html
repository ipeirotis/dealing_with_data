<P>In October of 1997, audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit I Know
What You Did Last Summer.  The film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in
the U.S., and even developed a cult following, much like the previous year's
100 million dollar grossing Scream.  When the trailer hit theaters in September
attached to Urban Legend, it looked like a wonderful follow-up.  Did it live up
to the first film?  The answer is no.</P>
<P>Jennifer Love Hewitt returns as Julie James, a survivor of the serial killer
that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before.  She has been so
upset since the incident.  Nightmares haunt her all over the place, but she has
to move on.  She know attends college, and is best friends with a funny,
outgoing girl named Karla (Brandy), who is trying to hook Julie up with Will
Benson, played by newcomer Matthew Settle.  Karla's boyfriend is Tyrell, the
funny, outgoing type, who is played by Soul Food's Mekhi Phifer.  Freddie
Prinze Jr. also returns as Ray, Julie's boyfriend from a year ago.  One
morning, Julie and Karla are called up by a local radio station who are
offering four tickets to the Bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital
of Brazil.  Of course, they answer it correctly, and they are off to the
Bahamas.  Julie wants Ray to come, but he declines the offer, so Karla secretly
invites Will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with Julie. 
After they arrive at their hotel, it is just them and the staff on the island. 
It starts off as the weekend of their dreams.  Something just had to come to
mess up the one care-free weekend of Julie's life though.  Ben Willis (Muse
Watson) is back, and he isn't letting anyone survive this time.  Will Ray come
to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one?</P>
<P>Jennifer Love Hewitt and Brandy turn in respectable performances.  Brandy in
particular was impressive, considering this is her first feature film.  You
could see that the characters were horrified, and they would do anything
possible to survive.  Matthew Settle and Freddie Prinze Jr. are a completely
different story.  Let's start with Settle.  Matthew is completely fake in this
film.  You could not believe a word coming out of his mouth.  You could tell he
was acting, and its reasons like him that this one isn't as good as the first
one.  He does do a good job towards the end, but that doesn't clear up the
scars he already left on the film.  Freddie Prinze Jr. is almost as bad as
Matthew Settle was.  He is almost completely unbelievable, and the majority of
his lines are completely meaningless and out of place.  We don't see him as
much as Settle, otherwise he could have done just as much damage as Settle did.
 Mekhi Phifer is alright as Tyrell, but yet again the dialogue is out of place.</P>
<P>The plot of I Still Know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the
movie.  I like where the filmmakers went with this second installment, but
maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one, it would have been a
bit better.  The cinematography and setting of their island are simply
wonderful.  There are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel.  The sound
is pretty good, but still not as creepy as the first film's.  Jennifer Love
Hewitt's song, "How Do I Deal" is also played for about thirty seconds.</P>
<P>I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is nothing compared to the first film. 
The first film was very suspenseful, and it contained some very memorable
scenes.  The last fifteen minutes of I Still Know What You Did Last Summer
really picked up, and almost reached the same level as the first film.  Before
this part in the film, there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares.  That
is okay though, because the film is still very much fun and there are a few
suspenseful scenes.  I think the reason this film wasn't as scary as the
original was because in the first one, the killer terrorized the people
involved in the incident.  He made them suffer for what they did.  In the
second film, Ben Willis just kills anyone he feels like.  He doesn't stick with
Ray and Julie, who were the ones he is actually after.  He had to go after
Karla, Will, and Tyrell.  If the characters he stalked were in some relation to
the incident that went on when he was ran over by Julie, Ray, Helen, and Barry,
it could have been much better, and it would have made a lot more sense.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- Not a disappointment, but a third in the series would be out
of hand.   </P>
