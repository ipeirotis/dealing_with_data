<PRE>                           FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Leslie Cheung, Zhang Fengyi, Gong Li.
Screenplay:  Lilian Lee and Lu Wei.
Director:  Chen Kaige.</PRE>
<P>     1993 has been quite a year for films with Chinese and
Chinese-American themes.  THE WEDDING BANQUET has received tremendous
critical praise; M. BUTTERFLY brought a Tony Award-winning play to the
screen; THE JOY LUCK CLUB has been playing to full houses and seems a
lock for many major award nominations.  Now comes Cannes Film Festival
Palme D'Or co-winner FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, and it becomes clear that
everything else was just a warm-up.  Director Chen Kaige has fashioned
a drama mesmerizing from first frame to last, and does so without
getting artsy or obscure.  This is a remarkably accessible epic, and
the best film of this year in any language.</P>
<P>     FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE spans fifty years in the relationship
between two Chinese opera stars.  In 1925, the two meet when the shy
Douzi is brought by his mother, a prostitute, to a training school for
opera performers.  He is immediatedly drawn to the cocky Shitou, and
the friendship grows through the often cruel training.  As adults, the
two become the most renowned opera stars in Beijing, and adopt new
stage names.  Douzi becomes Cheng Dieyi (Leslie Cheung), who plays the
female roles; Shitou is Duan Xiaolou (Zhang Fengyi), who plays the male
roles.  The love of Dieyi for Xiaolou in their stage roles carries over
into real life, and he becomes jealous when Xiaolou marries savvy
prostitute Juxian (Gong Li).  Over the years, their personal and
professional relationship is tested by the great events of their times,
including the Japanese invasion in 1937, the Communist takeover in
1949, and the Cultural revolution of the 1960s.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the most astonishing thing about FAREWELL is that in spite
of its scope, it's really a very simple, old-fashioned love triangle
which happens to be about a man and a woman both in love with the same
man.  The three principals are bold and dynamic characters, each of
whom never does exactly what is expected.  Dieyi is a fascinating
character, a man whose latent homosexuality is twisted as a youth by
training which requires him to sing, "I am by nature a girl, not a
boy."  Since it is only on stage in his role as Concubine Yu (in the
opera from which the film takes its name) that he can express his
sexuality and his love for Xiaolou openly, it is there that he chooses
to live his entire life.  When he makes a plea to students of the
Cultural Revolution not to abandon the opera of the Old Society, it's a
plea not just for the art form but for his only chance to by truly
himself.  Xiaolou is equally intriguing, a brash man who is more
interested in the fame performing grants him than the purity of the
form.  He is oblivious to Dieyi's feelings, referring to him frequently
as "my stage brother," yet even that level of friendship eludes
Xiaolou.  Rather, he treats Dieyi more or less as nothing but a
co-worker, a man whom he likes and even needs for his career, but
doesn't really respect.  This convoluted relationship leads the two men
to acts both of selfless heroism and complete betrayal.  Then there is
Juxian, perhaps the strongest character emotionally, self-assured to a
fault in male-dominated China and capable in that confidence of
surprising displays of forgiveness.  Her conflict with Dieyi powers
FAREWELL's most haunting moments.</P>
<P>     Chen Kaige's direction demonstrates a mastery of composition and
narrative structure rarely seen.  The opening sequence, a reunion
between Dieyi and Xiaolou which frames the flashbacks to come, is a
triumph of lighting and texture.  Chen crafts brilliant cuts, such as a
cut from Xiaolou's announcement of his engagement to Juxian, and his
request for Dieyi "to be my best man," to a full screen closeup of
Dieyi, still in his concubine makeup and looking not like a "best man"
but a rejected woman.  Also well-handled is Dieyi's affair with a male
arts patron whom he uses as a surrogate for Xiaolou, painted up as
Xiaolou's Chu King character from the opera.  Every shot is a minor
revelation, raising Chen to the level of one of modern cinema's true
masters.</P>
<P>     No amount of hyperbole will get some filmgoers to see a 2 1/2 hour
story with subtitles about marginalized characters.  I can't think of a
greater artistic tragedy.  FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE is a thrilling love
story, a political epic and an intimate character study rolled into one
stunning package.  If you've never seen a non-English language film
before, find this one.  It's just that good.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 operas:  10.</PRE>
