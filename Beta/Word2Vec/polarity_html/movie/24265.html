<P>Set in the late 80's at the height of yuppie excess and based on the
book by Bret Easton Ellis (who explored the same themes in another book
which was also made into a movie, Less Than Zero), American Psycho puts
a new spin on the yuppie "genre" that Ellis helped to create.  Christian
Bale is perfectly cast as Patrick Bateman, a high powered yuppie who
hides a terrible secret from his fiancée and his colleagues.  It seems
that Bateman is a serial killer and, unfortunately for his
contemporaries, his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip.  As he
tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering
co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies, his mental fabric
slowly begins to unravel.  </P>
<P>I was first introduced to the novel when I was still in high school.  I
read an Associated Press article in our local Sunday newspaper detailing
the problems Ellis was having getting his novel published due to the
controversial violence in it. As usual when anything is controversial I
try to seek it out, but I soon forgot about the novel and didn't end up
thinking about it again until I stumbled across it a couple of years
later at a bookstore.  I picked it up and read it, but was ultimately
disappointed because it left more questions than answers.  The movie has
a similar effect, but at least it's less cryptic than Ellis' novel.  For
once, a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was
based on.  </P>
<P>Both the book and the film open with Bateman describing his fastidious
morning preparations (down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating
creams he uses) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these
excesses throughout.  The movie continues to touch upon these things but
makes more of a point to immerse us in Bateman's impending madness than
to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does.  As a result, the
film is immensely more entertaining.  </P>
<P>Lions Gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films
(having picked up Kevin Smith's Catholic-rattling Dogma) and here with
American Psycho there is no difference.  Screenwriters Mary Harron and
Guinevere Turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about
yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film
out of it.  Some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from
getting an NC-17, mainly involving a sex scene comprising Bateman and
two women, and initial reports said the film was unwatchable. 
Thankfully, it IS watchable and Harron and Turner have made one of the
most scathingly satirical films this side of South Park:Bigger, Longer &
Uncut.  </P>
<P>Side Note #1: Co-writer Guinevere Turner also makes an appearance in the
film as an ill-fated acquaintance of Bateman's who, after Bateman
suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute, proclaims
that she's not a lesbian nor has any interest in it.  The ironic humor
of the scene stems from the fact that Turner (the writer/director of the
film Go Fish and who also assisted Kevin Smith with parts of his script
for Chasing Amy) is a lesbian.  It's a subtle in-joke and it's one I
found to be pretty humorous.  </P>
<P>Despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young
up-and-comers (including Reese Witherspoon), most of the roles are a
waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos.  The real draw
here is Christian Bale and his over-the-top performance as Patrick
Bateman.  Whenever I read a novel I always try to imagine what it would
be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters. 
I always had a hard time trying to decide who I would cast as Bateman,
but I never thought Bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his
ends up being.  To say Bale runs away with the character is a vast
understatement and he proves that he's as adept at chewing scenery as Al
Pacino or Rod Steiger.  One sequence in particular, involving Bateman
describing his love for Huey Lewis and the News' song "Hip to Be Square"
right before burying an axe in a co-worker's head, features one of the
most eccentric and kinetic performances I have ever seen on film.  </P>
<P>Side Note #2: Despite the fact that Huey Lewis' "Hip to be Square" and a
pair of Phil Collins songs appear in the film, don't expect to see them
on the soundtrack release.  Huey Lewis expressly requested that his
song, featured in a rather large set piece in the film (much akin to the
use of "Stuck in the Middle with You" in Reservoir Dogs), not be
included on any soundtrack release.  I'm assuming that Collins requested
the same.  On a similar note, Whitney Houston's cover of "The Greatest
Love of All" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and
it is very obvious that it isn't the Houston version at all but merely
an instrumental version culled from an unknown source.  Apparently,
Houston wasn't as open about the use of her song as the others were.  </P>
<P>A bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since
the film's release: that of whether or not Patrick has actually
committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film. 
Don't look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to
confuse you more.  Several web sites have been dedicated to the subject
but I'm still undecided.  There is evidence both for and against but the
most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the
film where Bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops, old ladies,
and cleaning staff with equal gusto.  The scene seemed very dream-like
and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying (as
an example, Bateman blows up a police car VERY cinematically after
firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the
car).  I kept waiting for Bateman to wake up and for the film to
continue on from there, but Bateman never does wake up and the whole
sequence, though comic, throws the film off-balance (which I suppose was
the intention).  </P>
<P>Other than the few flaws I have mentioned, American Psycho is an
incredibly entertaining film (although you may not leave the movie fully
understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred
in Bateman's reality).  I think this movie is destined for greatness as
a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such.  It may not
change anyone's life, but it will certainly have an effect.  I know I
will certainly hear "Hip to be Square" in a different context the next
time I hear it.  [R]</P>
