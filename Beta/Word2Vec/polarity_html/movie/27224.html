CAST AWAY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>CAST AWAY, which brings together FORREST GUMP's team of star Tom Hanks 
and director Robert Zemeckis, is nothing less than the best movie of the 
year.  And with tremendous poignancy and honesty, Tom Hanks delivers the 
best performance of the year.  A harrowing and deeply moving story, it 
is the scariest movie in years, not in a manipulative or artificial way 
but with incidents of genuine beauty and terror.  When you're not on the 
edge of your seat, you'll be jumping off of it.  But it is a rewarding 
film, not some cheap thrill, that makes you rethink what's important in 
life as well as how hard basic survival can be.</P>
<P>When we meet Chuck Noland (Hanks), he's a FedEx efficiency expert who is 
teaching Russian employees how to worship the clock god with the same 
religious fervor that he does.  Back home in Tennessee, Chuck has an 
almost fiancée, Kelly (Helen Hunt).  Hunt, who seems to be in every 
recent film, is an actress of whom you can never get enough.  With 
little screen time, she develops Kelly into an extremely sympathetic 
character.  The role could easily have been a throwaway since this is 
essentially a one man picture.  Well, there is also a volleyball, but 
more on that later.</P>
<P>Before Chuck leaves for Russia, we watch in flashback as he and Kelly 
exchange Christmas gifts.  He gives her a pager, and she gives him her 
grandfather's Southern Pacific pocket watch with her picture inside of 
it.  He promises to always keep it on "Memphis time, Kelly time."  These 
presents are exchanged in the exactly two minutes that he asks the FedEx 
flight to wait for him.  Promising, "I'll be right back," he leaves on 
his "brief" trip.</P>
<P>I've been in an airplane that went into freefall, and there is no more 
frightening experience.  Our plane pulled out in time, but Chuck's 
didn't.  The airline disaster is the first of many times that you'll be 
gripping yourself, your armrest, your companion or all three.  Don't be 
surprised if you scream.  This, however, is far from the last such 
experience that you will have while watching CAST AWAY.  
Self-administered dentistry and simple injuries will be others.  Even 
Zemeckis's recent WHAT LIES BENEATH isn't nearly as frightening as CAST 
AWAY because the former film was just a movie whereas CAST AWAY plays 
more like real life.  </P>
<P>After the plane crashes somewhere in an area of the Pacific ocean twice 
the size of Texas, Chuck ends up on a large, rocky island with no 
inhabitants.  Some FedEx packages wash up on shore with everything from 
ice skates to videotape.  Eventually he manages to put everything to 
good use, but daily survival becomes a tricky proposition.  Foraging for 
food and trying to create a fire prove much harder than you might 
suspect.</P>
<P>Chuck's Man Friday comes from a birthday present being mailed to a young 
boy.  Inside the box is a Wilson Sporting Good's volleyball, which Chuck 
calls Wilson after painting a face on it.  In order to keep his sanity, 
he bonds with the ball and loves it more than any pet.  This allows 
writer William Broyles Jr. (ENTRAPMENT) to have Chuck speak without 
having to resort to voice-over.  Hanks's body gestures and his limited 
conversation with Wilson tell the bulk of the story.  If you've 
foolishly harbored any doubts whatsoever about Hanks's acting ability, 
this movie will remove them.  It is a one man show in which we never 
tire of him.</P>
<P>After weeks on the island, the story jumps ahead four years in which an 
emaciated -- the filming was put on hold for 16 months so that Hanks 
could shed over fifty pounds -- and sullen Chuck labors away on his 
island prison.</P>
<P>While we are on the island, Zemeckis lets no background music spoil the 
feeling of being alone in nature.  A serious movie, it does provide some 
comedic flourishes to make it less difficult to watch.  </P>
<P>This story of a control freak who loses all hope of control after being 
lost in the wilderness is a hard one to end properly.  But to the 
writer's credit, he manages to make the end almost as gripping and 
successful as the rest of the picture.  Only in the unnecessary 
proclivity to too neatly tie up loose ends in the last scene or two does 
the movie ever fail us.</P>
<P>If they ever release a five hour director's cut of the movie, I'm there.  
It's that kind of story.  It could not be more absorbing.  We were only 
able to witness a small part of Chuck's 4 years stuck in his hellish 
paradise of an island.  We'd love to know more.  Still, we will always 
treasure what we learned when we were vicariously incarcerated there 
with him.</P>
<P>CAST AWAY runs 2:23 but feels shorter.  It is rated PG-13 for intense 
action sequences and some disturbing images.  It would be acceptable for 
teenagers, but the movie is likely to frighten most viewers regardless 
of age.</P>
