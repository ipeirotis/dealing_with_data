<PRE>1/2 Star (Out of 4)</PRE>
<P>Teenagers have a lot of power in Hollywood. Every year countless films 
will be made targeting that audience in particular, and rely on the 
entire teenage population to turn out on Friday and Saturday nights, 
wallets in hand. The formula is very simple, you make a film with a big 
name young actor or actress with sex appeal. You add a high school 
environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds, 
and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 
90 minutes, the typical teenage attention span. The response is enormous 
as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any =
film set in an environment they can relate to, and, most importantly, 
they don92t care to judge films=92 quality, so any piece of trash will =
due. That is just what Never Been Kissed, the latest film from director 
Raja Gosnell, is; trash.</P>
<P>Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore) is the youngest copy editor in the history 
of the Chicago Sun Times. She has her own personal assistant, unlimited 
supplies, and her own office. But she is very much dismayed with her 
position in life. There is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter 
and go out into the field, where she can play a more active role in the 
Chicago media. So when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her 
out of nowhere, she jumps at it with elation.</P>
<P>Constantly smothering Josie in the work place is her friend Anita (Molly 
Shannon) and her amicable superior, Gus (John C. Reilly). The two of 
them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first 
assignment, as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a 
reporter. However, since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with 
little patience for character conflict, this otherwise interesting 
scenario is resolved within two minutes, and Josie is headed for the 
field.</P>
<P>Obviously, the field assignment involves a high school. Specifically, 
she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school, by enrolling 
in the senior class and "becoming one of them." I don92t think that I =
need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation 
ever occurring, so I won92t.</P>
<P>The movie develops into Josie trying to find the life that she never led 
in high school. Interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a 
dork she truly was, and she appears to be heading down that road again. 
Fortunately for this lame production, other characters do appear that 
make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely 
interesting. They include the predictable love stories, between both a 
student (Jeremy Jordan) and a teacher (Michael Vartan), to show that 
Josie is really two people in one body. Also, her younger brother and 
opposite, Rob (David Arquette) comes into her new found life and even 
causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative.</P>
<P>The humor found in this film is actually quite amusing. Typical for 
teenage films, it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor. 
One scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving 
bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical. Most of the other jokes 
are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to 
high school can appreciate and will enjoy. But those still don92t =
recover for the total lack of quality in this movie.</P>
<P>Following this trend of high school movie rules, comes the general 
acting. It is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from 
film to film. In this case, Drew Barrymore is absolutely painful to 
watch. She is required to play her character on two levels, having some 
very black and white transitions. And although some scenes are written 
to be particular shades of gray, she seems to hold that color throughout 
all of her screen time. At one point she is alone with an obvious love 
interest on a Ferris wheel, and is expected to him on an adult level, 
since he is one, her teacher. But she never seems to get out of the gray 
area, and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good 
performance.</P>
<P>Following Barrymore is the pitiful Molly Shannon (Saturday Night Live). 
She seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can 
relate to, and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic. 
It is these "qualities" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene 
from being one of the few decent.</P>
<P>Luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise 
bleak film. David Arquette (Scream) takes home the prize for being able 
to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic, and 
not have his brilliant acting ruined. And as a central character he gets 
to take on his own mini-plot, which is one of the few well done parts of 
Never Been Kissed. In a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of 
work, he does an absolutely hilarious Tom Cruise impression from the 
1983 hit, Risky Business.</P>
<P>Never Been Kissed is a mediocre film at best. The predictable plot has 
become so overplayed in Hollywood, that it is sickening to watch time 
and again, and this film is no exception. The acting is just as bad, but 
there is the one positive presence of David Arquette to add some light. 
Unfortunately, the bottom line is that the movie will be a success, 
because teenagers will pay to see any trash.</P>
