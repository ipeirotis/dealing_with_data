SERIES 7
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>I don't know about you, but when I hear politicians railing against 
violence in movies, I'm never sure exactly what movies they are talking 
about.  Any example that I can think of never seems to be quite to the 
level that they are complaining about.  Well, I think I've found an 
example in SERIES 7, which is something akin to a PULP FICTION version 
of the television series "Survivor." </P>
<P>"The Contenders," consisting of five people chosen at random as well as 
the previous champion, are forced to fight to the death as they battle 
everywhere from homes to malls.  All the while, camera crews record 
their every movement.  The TV show's tag line is: "The only prize is the 
prize that counts: your life." Since this is the seventh version of "The 
Contenders," it is referred to as "Series 7." The movie feels like a 
television series in which the commercials have been removed.  You can 
tell where the station breaks for the commercials are supposed to be 
inserted.  </P>
<P>The movie's web site (www.series7movie.com), like the one for BLAIR 
WITCH (www.blairwitch.com), makes it appear that SERIES 7 is real.  It 
even provides a place for you to bid on one of the guns supposedly used 
in the series by reigning champion Dawn Lagarto (Brooke Smith), who has 
10 kills in 2 tours so far.  You can also sign up to be on the series.  
I suspect that many who visit this site will be repulsed as it could be 
argued that it does appear to glorify violence.  There is also a link on 
it to another fictional television show ("A Sniper in the Red Army") and 
to other sites including one all in Russian about guns.  You can also 
find handy links to apparently real sites about suicide prevention and 
about mortuaries.  Then again, they purposely make it hard to tell what 
is real and what isn't.</P>
<P>The six contestants for "Series 7," include Dawn, who is eight months 
pregnant.  To show you what a rotter she is, her sister says that Dawn 
wouldn't even agree to shave her armpits for her sister's wedding.  
Connie (Marylouise Burke) is an older ER nurse who doesn't approve of 
Dawn's loose morals.  Connie, who turns into a pretty cold blooded 
killer, isn't all sweetness and light herself.  Jeff (Glenn Fitzgerald) 
is a 33-year-old artist dying of testicular cancer, who keeps 
threatening to kill himself before the other contenders kill him first.  
Lindsay (Merritt Wever) is a teenager whose boyfriend bought her a 
spiffy bulletproof vest for her tour.  Lindsay's parents are very 
supportive of their daughter and make sure that she never leaves home 
without her guns.  And there are a couple of other contestants.</P>
<P>Although the program feels real, the contestants' actions do not.  They 
are the world's worst hiders.  They eat and walk in front of windows in 
clear view of passersby.  Even Dawn, the supposed best of the bunch, 
sits in obvious view in her car in front of the houses of the other 
contestants.  Not bothering to aim, she holds her gun nonchalantly and 
fires like a kid playing a cowboy with a toy pistol.</P>
<P>The show's premise is intriguing and parts are done well, but the 
repetitive nature of the format and the lack of convincing behavior by 
the actors turn what could have been a fascinating film into a 
sleep-inducing one.  There were several cute parts, of which one of my 
favorites was the show's "sudden death overtime" period, in which these 
words were taken literally.  This much you have to give the movie -- it 
never pulls its punches, it is quite unusual and it consistently sticks 
to its format.  You may not like the results, but you have to admire its 
courage.  Still, this is the sort of movie that will have some people in 
outrage.</P>
<P>SERIES 7 runs 1:25.  It is rated R for strong violent content and 
language and would be acceptable for college students.</P>
<P>The film opens in limited release in the United States on Friday, 
January 26.</P>
