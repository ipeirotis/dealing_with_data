TASTE OF CHERRY (director: Abbas Kiarostami; cast: Homayoun Ershadi (Mr.
Badii), Mir Hossein Noori (The seminarian), Abdolrahman Bagheri (Mr.
Bagheri, the taxidermist), Safar Ali Moradi (The soldier), 1997-Iran)</P>
<P>This is a come to your own conclusion movie, that might be a big let
down if you were expecting to see the fable that is presented here come
to a necessary resolution, but it is a film that gets better as you step
away from it and realize how much intellectual weight there actually was
in the telling of its austere story. It is vividly shot with a cast made
up of mostly nonprofessional actors, as the director, Abbas Kiarostami,
who many film critics consider to be one of the greatest living film
directors around, is known for his use of the long shot, as he uses it
to pan the harsh mountainous vistas and the faces of those itinerant
Iranians, who are seen through the eyes of a forlorn and, at times,
loquacious,  middle-aged driver of a luxurious Range Rover, Mr. Badii
(Ershadi), who is on a mission that he can't find the right words to
explain fully its meaning, who wants to kill himself, and whose odyssey,
takes us to the brown dirt fields and barren hills of the outskirts of
Tehran, as the film is searching for answers to something it doesn't
know for sure, as it relates to these three disciplines--- the military,
religion, and science; or, it could be as it relates to the Kurds,
Afghanis, and Turks; or as it relates to one's son, one's brother, and
one's father.</P>
<P>Whatever Badii is searching for, this basically is still a philosophical
movie, that asks people what is it that they want to get out of life and
are they prepared to do something to ensure for themselves a happiness
that hasn't been prescribed to them. It also indirectly asks the
question, why would any one in good health and being sane, want to kill
themselves.</P>
<P>Mr. Badii wants to pay someone to make sure he is dead. That night he
plans to swallow enough sleeping pills to kill himself and then he will
go lie down in a hole he has dug for himself in the outskirts of town.He
asks the various people he meets in his Range Rover, will you come to
the spot at 6 a.m. and call out my name? If I reply, help me out of the
hole. If I don't, cover my body with 20 spadefuls of dirt. Then take my
car and there will be 200,000 tomans inside the glove compartment for
you.</P>
<P>We don't really know the reason Mr. Badii wants to die and we know
almost nothing about his personal life, except when he mentions to the
poor seminarian he is trying to recruit for the job, that you don't know
how someone else feels, you may be able to sympathize with them, but you
could never understand their pain.</P>
<P>He seem to be an upper-class gentleman, as observed by his demeanor and
appearance. But again, we can only guess at who he is and why he wants
to commit suicide, to the director it is obviously not that important,
or else he would have provided us with more information.</P>
<P>We first see Mr. Badii drive slowly through the streets of Tehran, as
young men approach him asking for jobs as laborers. He then meets some
children happily playing in a rusted car, and we see the stark contrasts
of Iranian life, such as between the haves (Mr. Badii)-and-the have nots
(the laborers), a theme that will run through the director's work.</P>
<P>He first encounters a laborer as he reaches the outskirts of town, who
is on the job, but is presently talking on the phone, in an outdoor
phone booth, about his money problems, and Badii tells him he has a job
for him that pays plenty of money, but the laborer threatens to beat Mr.
Badii up if he doesn't mind his own business and go away. He probably
thought like I did, at first, that Badii was a pervert trying to pick
him up. He next meets a poor worker, in a UCLA sweatshirt he found in
the junk pile, who collects plastic bags for the factory to recycle, but
expresses no interest in Mr. Badii's offer to make a lot of money,
saying that this is what he knows how to do and doesn't want to do
anything else.</P>
<P>He gives a timid Kurd soldier a ride back to the barracks and tries to
engage him in a conversation, asking him what his army life is like, and
starts reminiscing back to his army days, which he says were the
happiest days in his life, where he met the friends he still has.The
soldier, who was a farmer as a civilian, and says he needs the money,
that army pay is not good enough, just doesn't want to do it, saying he
is no grave digger, and the first chance he gets to run away from him,
he does.</P>
<P>In his continuing quest, his car almost slides down the steep
embankment, as he goes up a hill where only quarry workers are at, and a
group of workers without saying anything, quickly come to his aid and
push him out of his predicament. Again, the contrast between the men'
silence and the noise from their work is explored.</P>
<P>When he comes across an old Afghani man, who is a security guard for a
construction company, that has a gigantic concrete making machine on its
premises, he tries to get the old man to come for a ride with him,
telling him no one will steal the stuff, it is too big, besides today is
a holiday. But the old man doesn't want to hear how unimportant his job
is, he just wants to do his duty, whatever it may be, as he invites
Badii up for some tea, making him climb up an unsteady ladder, which
ironically Badii complains is unsafe, and this from someone who is ready
to kill himself. It becomes evident to Badii that the lonely old man is
not willing to kill him, so he doesn't even bother to present him with
his proposal, but he turns his attention on the old man's young friend,
who is just visiting him for a couple of days, and is a fellow Afghani,
studying in the seminary. But he cannot do it for the reason that the
Moslem religion does not permit suicide, and Badii's cogent argument,
that sometimes by staying alive you do more harm to others than by
dying, just falls on deaf ears.</P>
<P>At a particularly depressing work-site, where the dust is whirling
around, and the workers all wear masks to help them breathe, Badii sits
in his car and seems to be oblivious to all the rocks and bad air around
him, and when a worker, who appears to be foreign, politely asks him to
move his car, that it is in the way of the bulldozer, he seems unable to
move or respond to the worker, as the worker asks him if he is feeling
well.</P>
<P>The next scene, someone with an older voice, is talking with Badii,
having already accepted the offer to do what he wants, as he has a sick
anemic child that he needs the money for.</P>
<P>Mr. Bagheri (Baghieri) is a Turk, who talks incessantly, giving the film
its lyrical voice it badly needed to counterpoint the tremendously
impressive visual scope the film has so far counted on to give it its
artistic touch, with its long shots of the barren mountain terrain the
soldiers train on and where the workers spend their life on, and its
close-ups on Badii in his vehicle. The table is now turned, as Badii
becomes very quiet because he does not have to talk Mr. Bagheri into
doing the job, as Mr. Bagheri tries his best to convince him that life
is worth living, as he tells him about how his own suicide attempt ended
in a failure, how he tried to hang himself on a mulberry tree, but ended
up tasting the mulberry. Then he asks Badii, Don't you want to taste the
cherry? Don't you want to see the dawn and the beauty of the sunset, and
the stars and the moon? As he offers logical reasons for staying alive,
that are indisputable. But Badii is concerned only with going over the
details of his plan with Mr. Baghieri, who it turns out works in the
museum of natural history, and is a man of science, a taxidermist, who
was out on the hills gathering quails to be stuffed. Again, the theme of
contrasts is shown, as a man who takes life, is also the one who argues
vehemently to preserve life.</P>
<P>The women we see all wear head scarves, which to the Westerner, is an
archaic way of treating women, but to Kiarostami, he could have shot
these women this way as a very subtle dig at Iranian culture, as he
shows that even educated women who are working at the museum are clad
that way, and one scarved modern woman asks Badii as he drives by, to
snap a photo of her and the man she is with. Kiarostami' point is that
all women are meant to be demeaned by such rigid laws of the state.</P>
<P>As I was trying to figure out where we were going with this suicide, the
film suddenly changed directions, and depending on how you feel a film
should be made, might depend on how you felt about what the director
did, which was to follow Badii back to his affluent apartment in town,
as we are not shown if he took the pills or not, and then we see it is
daytime and soldiers are doing marching drills in the hills and then
taking a break and joking around with each other, as a film crew is
talking to Badii, who is smoking a cigarette, with the film crew
indicating that they have just wrapped up shooting the film they were
working on, as a film within a film.</P>
<P>Films are meant to pose questions and not tell stories, is what the
director is now telling us, since questions are more important to him,
than anything else, they make us think harder about the things we do.</P>
<P>My thought about the death of the linear film, as pronounced by the
director, is that, if all you did was ask questions, as valuable as they
are in the process of educating yourself, you would still end up being
the idiot questioner, if that is all you did, question everything,
because somewhere along the line, if you are honest with yourself, you
will have to take a stand and state what it is you believe, and that
statement might come across best in a linear story or some other film
format, and not by posing more questions and becoming dogmatic about how
a film should be made.Why Kiarostami might resort to this form of
filmmaking, at least for this film, could have something to do with
Iran's repressive government and their long list of intolerances, that
if he openly criticized them, it would probably result in no more
Kiarostami films for foreigners to adore.</P>
<P>I'm a little reluctant to accept any one way of making films, as being
the vade mecum of filmmaking, you just try to do what you can, if the
film has a magic to it, it will work. I thought the ending of the film
was not only a cop out, you don't know for sure if Mr. Badii committed
suicide or not, but it also took the air out of the story's power and
made it seem like a tease someone plays on you, first getting your hopes
up and then going back on their word. Kiarostami was having fun with the
audience, and if you weren't in the mood for his jokes, then you might
have thought like I did, that it was just too contrived and took away a
very good experience I was having, with my imagination working on all
cylinders, stimulated by the complexity of the problems raised; and, by
ending the film on that false note, and shooting it on video instead of
film, it made it seem to me as if this was not a totally-serious attempt
to look at ourselves and the society we live in, as I originally thought
it was. If Kiarostami thought I needed a break at that point of the
film, that I was forgetting that it was just a film I was seeing, then
he miscalculated how I felt. But I still believe the film had a potent
political message that was delivered subterraneously, a message that is
meant to shake us out of the habitual way we look at life (and at film),
and fail to recognize how important our dreamworld really is to us.</P>
<P>And, in any case, I know from my past experiences with great filmmakers,
that sometimes I don't like what I see from them the first time and
later on change my mind and see more clearly what they were doing. So
I'll leave open the option that my distaste for the film's ending will
be subject to change, that is, if that is meant to be so.</P>
