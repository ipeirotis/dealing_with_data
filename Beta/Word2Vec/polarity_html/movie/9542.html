<P>     It's hard to believe that it's only been eight years since THE
LITTLE MERMAID made its first appearance in movie theaters.  Since the
film's bow in 1989, when it introduced Disney's "new era", the studio
has released six animated features (plus one leftover from the previous
regime, 1990's THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER).  Without exception, all of them
have taken their cue from THE LITTLE MERMAID:  a young, individualistic
protagonist proves himself/herself with the aid of a few cute sidekicks
while finding time to sing several songs along the way.  It's not a
terribly interesting premise, but, when done well, it makes for an
entertaining ninety minutes.  Lately, with movies like POCAHONTAS, THE
HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, and HERCULES, Disney has been getting stuck in
a rut, and the enjoyability quotient has been in a rapid decline.  The
re-issue of THE LITTLE MERMAID reminds us how agreeable the animated
releases were just a few years ago.</P>
<P>     If Disney was the genial, family-friendly corporation they pretend
to be, we could believe that it's just a coincidence that THE LITTLE
MERMAID's re-release coincides with 20th Century Fox's big push for what
could be the best non-Disney animated film ever, ANASTASIA.  The real
reason is less altruistic -- the Mouseketeers don't want any competition
in this arena, and they have taken the most effective steps available to
them to stifle it -- bring back one of the most beloved recent classics
and hope audiences spend their dollars on THE LITTLE MERMAID rather than
ANASTASIA.</P>
<P>     Despite revitalizing Disney's fortunes and introducing the present
wave of big-screen cartoons, THE LITTLE MERMAID was not a groundbreaking
motion picture, although it was the first animated movie to so
thoroughly incorporate songs into the narrative.  With big production
numbers like "Under the Sea" and "Kiss the Girl", and several other
hummable melodies, the film makers did their best to create the cartoon
equivalent of a musical.  Considering that the tunes are among the best
ever penned by the songwriting team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman
(the creators of LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, who went on to do BEAUTY AND
THE BEAST and ALADDIN for Disney), this move turned out to be a
fantastic success.  And, like all musicals, much of the enjoyment comes
as a result of simply enjoying the singing, rather than being carried
away by the relatively uncomplicated story.</P>
<P>     THE LITTLE MERMAID is loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen
fable, albeit with a radically changed ending.  Ariel (voice of Jodi
Benson) is the rebellious teenage mer-daughter of Triton, King of the
Sea (Kenneth Mars).  She is obsessed with the culture of those who live
on land, and keeps a secret treasure trove of objects recovered from
shipwrecks.  One day, while swimming around with her fish pal, Flounder
(Jason Marin), and her chaperone, the crab Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright),
Ariel comes upon a sinking ship and saves a handsome young human, who
turns out to be a prince named Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes), from
drowning.  Ariel is smitten, but when her father finds out about her
excursions to the surface, he is furious.  Hurt and desperate, the young
mermaid falls into the trap of the sea-witch Ursula (Pat Carroll), who
offers her a deal:  in return for being transformed into a human, Ariel
must cause Eric to fall in love with her in less than three days,
otherwise her soul will belong to Ursula.  To seal the bargain, Ariel
gives her voice to the witch.  What the mermaid doesn't know, however,
is that Ursula has stacked the deck so that Ariel can't possibly emerge
victorious.</P>
<P>     The animation in THE LITTLE MERMAID isn't quite as accomplished or
eye-popping as that of its successors, but it's still impressive, and
hurried or unfinished cels are almost impossible to spot.  What the film
does expertly is to weave together music, likable protagonists,
thoroughly nasty villains, and a fun plot into a cohesive whole, with a
result that is nothing short of magical.  And, although THE LITTLE
MERMAID isn't among Disney's most "mature" animated movies, it offers
enough entertainment, innocent romance, and low-key humor to keep adults
involved.  Children, of course, will love it.</P>
<P>     THE LITTLE MERMAID boasts a particularly strong vocal cast,
although, other than Buddy Hackett (who plays a seagull named Scuttle)
and Rene Auberjonois (a French cook), there are few recognizable names.
But Jodi Benson gives Ariel a clear, beautiful voice and a delightfully
silvery laugh; Pat Carroll brings Ursula to life with sultry gusto; and
Samuel E. Wright creates a crab with a penchant for reggae.  Other
voices include Christopher Daniel Barnes in the rather bland role of
Eric, Jason Marin as Flounder, and Ben Wright as Grimsby, Eric's
faithful manservant.</P>
<P>     The biggest obstacle for Disney is that many children have already
seen THE LITTLE MERMAID on videotape, and most kids don't care about the
differences between the theatrical presentation of a movie and one in
the living room.  Nevertheless, for those who haven't seen the film on
either the big or the small screen, or for anyone who wants a chance to
view it again after an eight-year absence, it's well worth a trip to the
local multiplex (and, according to the studio, this will be a limited,
two-week run).  For ninety minutes of pure escapism, it's difficult to
beat THE LITTLE MERMAID.</P>
