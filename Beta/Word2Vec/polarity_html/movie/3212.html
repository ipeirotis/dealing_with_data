                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Gary Oldman, Jeroen Krabbe, Isabella Rossellini,
           Johanna Ter Steege, Valeria Golino.
Screenplay/Director:  Bernard Rose.</P>
<P>     Every time a film based on actual events or including real
historical figures appears, it seems that there are scholars stepping
over each other to decry its lack of faithfulness to historical fact.
Whether it's Shoeless Joe Jackson batting right handed in FIELD OF
DREAMS, or the condensed time line in the recent QUIZ SHOW, or any of a
hundred other possible examples, there seems to be a widespread refusal
to allow film dramas to be exactly that:  dramatizations of real
events, no more documentary than the re-creations on "America's Most
Wanted."  IMMORTAL BELOVED is based on a footnote in the life of Ludwig
von Beethoven, which will doubtless inspire Beethoven biographers to
inveigh against its questionable scholarship.  As a moviegoer, my only
question is, "Does it succeed as drama?"  The answer for IMMORTAL
BELOVED is that while it is sometimes quite enjoyable, it is better
experienced than analyzed.</P>
<P>     IMMORTAL BELOVED opens in 1827, shortly after the death of
Beethoven (Gary Oldman).  In the course of tying up Beethoven's
affairs, his personal secretary Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe)
discovers a final will leaving Beethoven's entire estate to a woman
identified in a letter only as "my immortal beloved."  Schindler sets
out to discover the identity of the woman among the composer's many
lovers, including Countess Giulietta Guicciardi (Valeria Golino) and
Countess Anna Maria Erdody (Isabella Rossellini).  Through their
recollections, Beethoven's life and abrasive personality emerge in
flashback, including his struggle to hide his deafness from the world
and his bitter battle with his sister-in-law Johanna (Johanna Ter
Steege) for the custody of his nephew.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the best, if most precious, way to describe IMMORTAL
BELOVED is as LUDWIG VON-ADEUS.  Writer/director Rose has mounted a
sumptuous production, gloriously scored with the subject's compositions
and intended to bring some humanity to a figure most often seen as a
wildly coiffed bust on a marble pedestal.  And he manages to deliver
some marvelous sequences:  the sea of mourners greeting Beethoven's
casket; his deafness revealed to an audience as he attempts to conduct
an orchestra; the beautifully staged premiere of the 9th Symphony, as
the "Ode to Joy" accompanies flashbacks to Beethoven's difficult
childhood.  Rose manages to wed sound to image in that manner that is
uniquely cinematic, evocative without ever lapsing into
pretentiousness.</P>
<P>     As successful as IMMORTAL BELOVED is as a sensory experience, it
is not nearly as successful at establishing character.  For better or
worse, AMADEUS managed to make Mozart a character we could relate to;
IMMORTAL BELOVED does not quite manage that feat with Beethoven.  He is
always somewhat remote, even as we witness his struggle with disability
and his volatile interpersonal relationships.  Gary Oldman returns to
earth from his whacked-out recent performances, and is quite good as
the angry and isolated composer.  But the fragmented nature of the
narrative allows us only unsatisfying glimpses of the man Beethoven
might have been, and even Rose's tendency to film Oldman in medium and
long shots contributes to this distancing effect.</P>
<P>     Rose's choice of the "immortal beloved" letter might have seemed
perfect as a jumping off point for examining Beethoven as a character,
but too often it just doesn't work.  Part of the reason behind
Schindler's near-obsessive pursuit of the identify of the woman in the
letter is that he is fascinated by the object of such passion in this
often hateful man, but Rose lets both us and Schindler down by leaving
key relationships under-developed, particularly the relationship
between Beethoven and the woman Rose selects as the real "immortal
beloved."  When the film stops dead for Schindler to talk to one woman
or another about Beethoven, we expect some insight, and there just
isn't all that much.</P>
<P>     Though I have focused on many of IMMORTAL BELOVED's failings, I
should make it clear that on the whole, I enjoyed it, particularly in
the moment I was watching it.  Music coordinator Georg Solti fills the
theater with grand music, and those scenes which simply feature music
accompanying Rose's images are quite powerful.  But afterwards, I
realized what that made IMMORTAL BELOVED: a somewhat ineffectual plot
connecting some exceedingly well-made music videos.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 symphonies:  6.</PRE>
