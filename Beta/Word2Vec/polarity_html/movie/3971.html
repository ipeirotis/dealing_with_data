<P>     In the late 1980s, when pro-democracy movements were springing up all
around the world, China was not the only nation to brutally squash
dissension.  Far from the glare of the television camera, similar events
were transpiring in Burma.  Peaceful demonstrations turned into bloodbaths,
prisoners were shot en masse, and over 700,000 men, women, and children fled
across the borders.  However, as the narrator of BEYOND RANGOON notes,
because of the lack of press coverage, for most of the world, it was as if
it didn't happen.</P>
<P>     One of the most difficult tasks a film maker faces when bringing to
life a story with a particular political or social point-of-view is
involving -- not isolating -- the viewer.  It's far too easy for a "cause"
motion picture to become dry and uninteresting.  With BEYOND RANGOON,
director John Boorman (DELIVERANCE, THE EMERALD FOREST) has taken the
situation in Burma and reduced it to a personal level.  He has placed a lone
American woman in the eye of the storm and, while the audience watches, she
is swept along by the violent currents of August 1988.</P>
<P>     That woman is Laura Bowman (Patricia Arquette), a young American doctor
visiting the Far East in hopes of finding escape from the recent tragedy
which has ripped apart her life.  One day in the not-too-distant past, she
returned home from work to find her house ransacked and her husband and
young son brutally murdered.  Since then, she has shut herself off to all
emotion, turning, in her words, to stone.</P>
<P>     One night while her tour group is staying in a Rangoon hotel, Laura
wanders into the streets and becomes caught up in a pro-democracy rally led
by charismatic activist Aung Sein Suu Kyi (who won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1991).  While there is tension between government forces and the student
demonstrators, no open confrontation takes place, and Laura returns to her
room unmolested.  The next day, however, she discovers that she lost her
passport the previous night and, since the Burmese government will not let
anyone leave the country without one, she is unable to depart as scheduled
with her sister and the rest of her tour group.</P>
<P>     After eventually acquiring a new passport from the U.S. Embassy, Laura
decides to spend some time exploring.  She soon locates an "unofficial" tour
guide (U Aung Ko), and enlists his aid in bribing her way through
checkpoints to meet people and go to places that no outsider normally sees.
However, the tour guide turns out to be a pro-democracy activist and, when
the Burmese government declares martial law, Laura becomes caught up in a
struggle she previously had no idea existed.</P>
<P>     Besides being an intelligent and gripping thriller with a solid
grounding in real, recent historical events, BEYOND RANGOON also gives
movie-goers a rare opportunity to watch a female hero.  These days, the
strongest roles for women are the ever-present femme fatales (like Linda
Fiorentino in THE LAST SEDUCTION) that populate film noir.  It's unusual to
find a solid, well-rounded character the likes of Laura Bowman, and, while
Patricia Arquette has a few awkward moments, she mostly does a credible job
with a part that requires emotional and physical range.</P>
<P>     The cinematography by John Seale is spectacular.  It's easily among the
best jobs of the year, and far more impressive than the usual approach of
"take the camera and do a few widescreen shots of the countryside."  Seale
plays with light and color, and uses Burma's natural beauty to highlight the
characters.  BEYOND RANGOON is a visual masterpiece, yet rarely does the
photography take away from the storyline.</P>
<P>     Boorman has succeeded in an arena where Oliver Stone so often fails.
By toning down the melodrama and manipulation, BEYOND RANGOON calls
attention to a situation without becoming overly didactic.  Rarely does this
film lose its edge -- the characters are well-defined and the pacing is
tight.  And the message comes across -- few who sit through this picture
will react quite the same way when a story about Burma airs on the nightly
news.</P>
