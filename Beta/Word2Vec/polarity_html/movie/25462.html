<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This innocent comedy from Spain just didn't have enough impact to hit a
home run with its humor. It probably has more relevancy for its native
audience (at least, I hope it does), as most of its TV sitcom sketches
just didn't register with my domestic comedy/romance antenna. The film's
main asset is its popular star, Carmen Maura, considered by many Spanish
film critics to be Spain's most accomplished actress. She reminded me of
Lucille Ball on her long running TV show "I Love Lucy." If you like that
sort of comedy, then you might like this film.</P>
<P>The director Ana Belén is a popular movie actress and singer, while
writer Carmen Rico-Godoy is a popular novelist and journalist. The story
is probably autobiographical:
the heroine (Carmen Maura) is a journalist named Carmen, and the film is
layed out in four sections, just like a newspaper, but here the
divisions relate to the time of season. Carmen is a bad tempered, modern
Madrid woman, who has been married three times and is trying desperately
to make this marriage with Antonio (Antonio Resines) work. Antonio is an
overweight, balding, amiable record producer, who depends on his wife to
take care of the house and give him advice on how to take care of
himself.</P>
<P>The film opens with the chapter entitled "Summer," as Carmen meets her
husband at the airport. He wants to go to the beach -- she doesn't. We
hear her private thoughts, as she decides to be nice and accompany him
there. When a beautiful blonde in a deck chair next to them exposes her
breasts, Carmen becomes jealous that her husband is staring at the
younger woman. This will begin a long litany of domestic fights that
occur between the constantly bickering couple. All the fights are mild
and over the most trivial of things, which is supposed to make this very
materially comfortable couple look ridiculous, since it is obvious that
they have so much going for them that there is no reason for them to be
fighting all the time.</P>
<P>Their next fight is at an upscale restaurant they go to with another
bourgeois couple, Mariano and Chelo. The argument starts when he orders
a fattening lamb meal and she makes a comment. He then changes the order
and waits for her to tell him what he can eat. While they absurdly
argue, she makes faces and he makes faces, and there is comedy in the
faces they make.</P>
<P>In autumn, Antonio signs a girl rock singer-drummer to a recording
contract, and when Carmen comes to the studio she sees them embracing,
misunderstanding that she is just being comforted by him. At home, she
interacts amusingly with her maid Emilia, greets Antonio's son Diego,
from his first marriage, who returns to live with them after being
abroad for a few months. Welcomes back her older son Sergio from
boarding school, while she deftly handles that Diego has been smoking
pot. She is in charge of the homefront.</P>
<P>During Christmas week she goes shopping with her attractive daughter
Marta, and feels old when she is called mother, telling her not to call
her that in public. Preparing to go to
Antonio's mother's house for a Christmas dinner, she has to tell him
what tie to wear and how to dress. At the party, they get into another
of their trivial spats. After being told by Antonio to buy the presents,
Antonio's mother receives a Cartier watch and exclaims how beautiful it
is. Antonio tells his wife, "What are you trying to do, break me?" She
then tells him, "The watch only looks expensive, it was really quite
cheap." He then argues with her
about getting his mother a cheap, imitation gift. At the workplace, she
feels she is being discriminated because she is a woman and only the men
get to be the bosses. She refuses a promotion from her editor (Casares)
because she says she is more competent than the supervisor she will be
working for, and if she accepts and does well in her journalism, he will
get all the credit, but if she messes up, she will be the only one
taking the blame.</P>
<P>Spring brings out the romance in Carmen, as she sits in the park envious
of all the slender young girls going by, ogles a handsome man walking
by, and decides to cheer herself up by buying a sexy blouse. There's
also a melodramatic restaurant scene, where she  meets with Antonio to
patch up their differences, as they have been temporarily separated. He
tells her that he can't live without her, which she reacts badly to,
running out of the restaurant, but soon returns.</P>
<P>Somehow the film flew by, aided by its breezy pace, non-stop banter, and
the lightheartedness of its direction. It was a sweet, palpable, likable
little domestic comedy, similar to what American audiences saw on TV in
the 1950s and 1960s (except for the nudity and frank sexual talk).
Carmen Maura put on a good show, outwitting the episodic script and
coming to terms with her great mid-life crisis in a pleasing manner.
It's a mild film, with mild comedy, and mild points to make about
domestic relations. It is deserving of mild praise for its execution.</P>
