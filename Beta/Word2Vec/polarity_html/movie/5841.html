<P>     Travis Bickle (TAXI DRIVER).  Rupert Pupkin (THE KING OF COMEDY). 
Max Cady (CAPE FEAR).  Dwight Hansen (THIS BOY'S LIFE).  These are a few 
of the names from the gallery of psychos essayed by celebrated actor 
Robert De Niro during his thirty-year career.  And, though each of these 
characters is unique, there exists at least one common element amongst 
them (other than the obvious) -- they are all three-dimensional 
creations, individuals who attain a terrifyingly believable life.  The 
credit for this goes to both De Niro and to the writers and directors 
who sketched the outlines that he so ably filled in.</P>
<P>     Therefore, given De Niro's track record, it was reasonable to 
expect good things from him in THE FAN, director Tony Scott's followup 
to last year's blockbuster, CRIMSON TIDE.  In fact, with De Niro playing 
a sociopathic baseball nut, one might be forgiven mistakenly believing 
that this movie had potential.  Unfortunately, whatever promise the idea 
held was lost early in the film making process.  The version of THE FAN 
to reach movie screens is as unwatchable a thriller as has come to 
theaters this  year.</P>
<P>     De Niro, in fact, is part of THE FAN's problem.  Mugging it up for 
the camera, he gives a tasteless, uninteresting, caricature-like 
portrayal.  The actor, who's usually a delight to watch, turns in one of 
his worst performances as the troubled Gil Renard, a recently fired 
hunting-knife salesman with an unhealthy passion for Giants baseball.  
Gil latches onto the Giants' latest free-agent acquisition, superstar 
centerfielder Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes, doing a credible Barry Bonds 
impersonation), who signed a multiyear, $40 million contract to play 
with the San Francisco team.  Gil, whose personal life is a mess (he's 
divorced and his ex-wife has taken out a restraining order on him), 
becomes fixated on Bobby, and it doesn't take him long to cross the line 
from obsessive fan to stalker.</P>
<P>     After the 1994 strike, one could make the case that baseball no 
longer deserves anyone's respect, but it's hard to argue that it merits 
the ghastly treatment handed out by Tony Scott.  THE FAN treats everyone 
associated with the game -- fans, announcers, and players -- with 
contempt.  Not only is the script superficially nasty, but the game 
sequences are poorly-filmed, with quick edits used to disguise the fact 
that hardly anyone involved (with the possible exception of ex-Major 
Leaguer John Kruk) can actually swing the bat.  Baseball credibility is 
thrown out the window, especially during the impossible-to-swallow 
climactic struggle, which (believe it or not) echoes a similar scene 
from THE NAKED GUN.</P>
<P>     Actually, I might have been able to forgive THE FAN its liberties 
if it had been remotely enjoyable.  But it's not -- the film replaces 
tension and excitement with reel after reel of tedium.  The script 
spends too much time with cardboard characters like Bobby and Gil, while 
introducing others like sports radio host Jewel Stern (Ellen Barkin) who 
serve no purpose whatsoever.  The entire first hour is devoted to 
showing what is immediately obvious:  that Gil is a borderline nutcase 
with a volatile temper and a love of knives.</P>
<P>     Something must have gotten lost in the translation from book to 
movie.  Phoef Sutton's script is based on a novel by Peter Abrahams, and 
it has all the characteristics of a hatchet job.  THE FAN is disjointed, 
poorly paced, and, at times, completely incoherent.  While Sutton has to 
bear some of the blame, the lion's share goes to Tony Scott, who has 
badly mishandled every aspect of this film.  The director appears to 
have backslided into his unpromising BEVERLY HILLS COP II phase.</P>
<P>     Aside from Snipes' well-tuned performance and a few clever scenes 
detailing superstar marketing, this picture is a veritable wasteland.  
Even watching the horror show that the real Giants have become during 
the 1996 season is more fun than this.  The advertising slogan may be 
"fear strikes soon", but, when it comes to THE FAN, fear, like the 
movie, strikes out.</P>
