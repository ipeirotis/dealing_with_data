<P>     When I picture Michael Keaton, the image that comes to mind is one 
of an affable, ordinary guy with a comic edge -- the kind of person who 
has made his mark in films like MR. MOM, MY LIFE, THE PAPER, and 
MULTIPLICITY.  I don't envision Batman or Bruce Wayne (a role he has 
played twice), and I certainly don't think of a sociopath mass murderer.  
Yet, in DESPERATE MEASURES, a preposterous thriller from director Barbet 
Schroeder (SINGLE WHITE FEMALE), that's exactly what Keaton is -- a 
ruthless, amoral killer whose steely eyes and cold-blooded humor inspire 
equal parts revulsion and wariness.  In fact, it wouldn't be too far 
from the truth to say that the actor's work is the only worthwhile 
element of the film.  </P>
<P>     Alas, when the viewer looks beyond Keaton's performance, it's 
pretty much a wasteland.  The story, which begins with a modicum of 
promise, quickly devolves into a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow 
action setups.  There are all the usual explosions, shoot-outs, and car 
crashes (a jackknifing tractor trailer must have been difficult to 
choreograph).  Ultimately, DESPERATE MEASURES is basically one long 
chase sequence, and its appeal is likely to be limited even for those 
who enjoy that sort of thing.  To vary the film's tone and rhythm, the 
movie makers incorporate a number of classic thriller clichés, including 
one of the most overused of all -- the child in danger.  However, the 
realization that children do not die in mainstream American movies 
drains away whatever little tension DESPERATE MEASURES tries to generate 
through this plot device.</P>
<P>     Nine year old Matthew Connor (Joseph Cross) is dying of Leukemia.  
His days are numbered and his only chance is a bone marrow transplant.  
His increasingly desperate father, Frank (Andy Garcia), a veteran of the 
San Francisco P.D., has finally located a potential donor, but it's not 
good news.  The man with a chance to save Matt's life is convicted 
killer Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton), a cold-hearted villain who sees 
the operation as an opportunity to break loose.  So, after stringing 
everyone along by making them believe that he cares about "redemption" 
for the bad things he has done, Peter stages an improbable escape.  
Frank is on his tail, however, but the killer isn't worried.  The bone 
marrow of a dead man is useless, so Frank has to protect Peter at all 
costs, or lose his son in the process.</P>
<P>     Every movie demands a certain level of suspension of disbelief from 
an audience, but the bar for DESPERATE MEASURES is so high that the 
thinking movie-goer will never attain it.  In many ways, this movie is 
more absurd than DIE HARD, and it certainly isn't as tightly-scripted or 
well-produced (nor is it intended to be as blatantly cartoonish).  On 
top of that, the action isn't very original and the degree of tension is 
surprisingly low for a tale that features such high stakes.  Then again, 
as I indicated earlier, it's not hard to guess how the film is going to 
end.  Predictable thrillers are not the most energetic movies.</P>
<P>     Other than Keaton's portrayal, the best performance is turned in by 
a young boy, Joseph Cross, who's making his feature debut.  Cross brings 
a refreshing level of pragmatism to Matt.  The mortally ill child 
understands what's going to happen, and accepts it.  The result is an 
engaging character instead of an irritating whiner or someone who tugs 
shamelessly at our heartstrings with cloying displays of cuteness.  The 
best scenes in DESPERATE MEASURES are those featuring Keaton and Cross 
after Peter kidnaps Matt.</P>
<P>     I've never particularly liked Andy Garcia in thrillers, and his 
flat work here serves only to confirm that opinion.  Garcia is at his 
best in dramas; he seems out of his depth when physical acting takes 
precedence over dialogue.  The two primary supporting actors, Marcia Gay 
Harden (THE SPITFIRE GRILL) as Matt's doctor, and Brian Cox (THE BOXER) 
as the chief of police, aren't given enough substantive material to 
determine whether they're doing good jobs or merely picking up their 
paychecks.</P>
<P>     There's a twist at the end, but it's not much of a surprise, and, 
even without reflection, it understates just how stupid the plot is.  
DESPERATE MEASURES is one of a broad category of thrillers that insults 
its audience with its obvious idiocy.  Worse still, there's not enough 
good action to partially redeem the production.  These features make 
DESPERATE MEASURES an exercise in futility, and, when you consider how 
many contrivances the characters have to endure to reach the ending, you 
may think that the title has more to do with the film makers' approach 
than with anything that happens on screen.</P>
