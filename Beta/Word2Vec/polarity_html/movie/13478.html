<PRE>CAN'T HARDLY WAIT (1998)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>

Starring: Ethan Embry, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Peter Facinelli, Lauren
Ambrose, Charlie Korsmo, Seth Green, Michelle Brookhurst, Erik Palladino,
Melissa Joan Hart, Breckin Meyer, Donald Adeosun Faison, Jerry O'Connell,
Jenna Elfman</P>
<P>The most interesting part of "Can't Hardly Wait" just happens to be not
only the most human, but for many of us, the one part that many of us can
easily relate to.  That is the character of Denise (Lauren Ambrose), the
film's sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film,
and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored.  The film
wisely holds over this moment, nicely showing her alienation in the midst
of a large high school party...almost too nicely.  For some members of the
audience (read: me), this is basically a mirror of what's going on with
them watching this film.  We sit there wondering why we've even bothered to
see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire
to go to in the first place.</P>
<P>I would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this. 
After all, this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of
which I went to high school with.  Everyone's here: the Jock, the
Homecoming Queen, the Nerd (and his dominions of Trekkies and X-Philes),
the Alienated Wannabe Writer, the School Spirit Girl, the Pothead(s), the
Wigger, etc, etc, etc, and weirdly enough this film shows them as
superficial, lame, and basically as a bunch of losers.  Except for Denise,
who rolls her eyes at everything, and easily becomes the most likable
character even before she speaks (her yearbook entry, something which is
done for each main character, quotes Oscar Wilde - definite pointers
there).</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the writers and directors take several major misteps on the
way to making this into an admirable and even likable film.  The film, as I
said, portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally
ignorant to everything.  However, instead of sticking with this, perhaps
even going a bit further with it, they let this lie, and actually make
these characters into our heroes.  We follow several of them, all a bunch
of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism, and
tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we
actually cared and/or identified with them.  And if we did, we certainly
don't want to revisit that state of being.</P>
<P>Here's a quick low-down: it's graduation, and we follow a bunch of seniors
on the last night, otherwise known as the "American Grafitti" or, to a
lesser extent, the "Dazed and Confused" cliche.  The formal just followed
them as they drove aimlessly; the latter did a little bit of that and
featured a big outdoor keg party.  "Can't Hardly Wait" just opts for a big
indoor keg party, and a little bit of aimless driving, albeit of the
I'm-whining-because-I-can't-get-a-girl-I-want brand.  We follow many people
around, but mostly we trail Preston (Ethan Embry, of "That Thing You Do!"),
the Alienated Writer, who's been pining over the Homcoming Queen, Amanda
(the totally overrated Jennifer Love Hewitt), for the entirety of High
School because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a
freaking Pop Tart.  Now that she's broken up with her football player
boyfriend, Mike (Peter Facinelli), he decides to go to the party with a
note he's written declaring his "love" for her in the hopes he'll build up
the guts to give it to her...even though he's leaving for a multi-week
intensive writing program hosted by none other than Kurt Vonnegut (okay:
the ingenius Vonnegut or some icky Noxema spokesperson?).</P>
<P>Since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with
it wouldn't be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film, and
because it's a party, there are some more main characters, such as: William
(Charlie Korsmo, finally surfacing after "Dick Tracy"), the Nerd (and his
dominions) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage
Mike, who's humiliated him for years, but gets too caught up in drinking to
do it; Kenny (Seth Green), the Wigger, who has decided that this party will
be where he will finally get laid (uh huh); and Denise, the only
exceptional character, who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom (don't
ask) with Kenny where the two characters let down their characters and are
allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point A to point B with
nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile.  Ugh.</P>
<P>The main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not
"American Grafitti" or "Dazed and Confused," two films that embraced and
ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers (not to mention
were extremely entertaining), but to John Hughes films of the 80s, most
notably "Sixteen Candles."  The big difference in the two is that that film
managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters, and did
so equally and in an entertaining fashion.  This film forgets to satirize
its characters, and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting
stereotypes...and then says that it's all okay.  We can't take this film
seriously, nor can we take this as fun, so really what good is it?</P>
<P>But I will tell you some things I did like: I liked the direction, except
for a couple too-over-the-top features, like way-too-glossy jump cuts (it's
like an oxymoron) and other obscurities.  Generally, though, Elfont and
Kaplan do have graceful camera movement, and even manage to capture an
Altman-esque feel to their film from time to time (a thing with a note,
though, is too hokey to really be admirable).  I actually did like Seth
Green, for once in about a decade (when he played a very young Woody Allen
in "Radio Days") - his desintegration of his Wigger character was almost
believable...almost.  And, of course, Lauren Ambrose is wonderful as
Denise, the one character we could have used some more of, even though it
would have changed the entirety of the film.</P>
<P>However, the character of Denise really doesn't work with the film, when
really thought about.  She's far too witty and realized (at least for the
first half) to belong in this film, and whenever she appears, she
automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone.  She's not
just The Cynic or The Intellectual; she's just a very interesting character
who provides entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged
characters.  She may ruin the film more, but at least when she's on screen
we can sit up and think to ourselves "Well, at least we'll be entertained."</P>
<P>A couple other things that just don't work: Mike's character, who suffers
an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has
forgotten everything: too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in
general; the aimless, bitchy driving by Preston to try and get over his
inability to shack up with Amanda - give me a break; and perhaps the one
thing that just doesn't work at all: Jenna Eflman's uncredited cameo as an
angel - just didn't work, but nice try.</P>
<P>Basically the worst thing about this film, the real reason I'm giving this
such a low rating, is because it refuses to give us any fully realized
characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from
other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we'd do.  We
don't feel for these characters because for most of us, we aren't
stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots.  The acid test for
high school movies is: does it at all capture the feel of what it's
portraying?  The answer for this film is no.  Nice try, though.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): *1/2</PRE>
