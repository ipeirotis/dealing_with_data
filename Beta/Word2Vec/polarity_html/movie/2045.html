<P>     Jefferson Reed (Robert Townsend) is the meekest of meek school
teachers, living in a neighborhood that is rapidly being overrun by the
Golden Lords, a drug-dealing and violence-loving gang.  One night,
however, Jefferson has an unexpected rendezvous with a green, glowing
meteor.  The collision imparts him with a number of superhuman powers,
including the ability to see through solid objects, move with
lightning-quick speed, and (of course) fly.  The problem is that
Jefferson's basic personality is the same.  He's a reluctant superhero,
not wanting the job of cleaning up the neighborhood.  But as word gets
out about "Meteor Man", the Golden Lords intend to make sure that he
doesn't have a choice in the matter.</P>
<P>     THE METEOR MAN is a mostly-unsatisfying film that can't decide
whether it wants to spoof superhero films or join their number.  In
attempting to walk a fine line between the two alternatives, it
succeeds at neither.  Actor/director/writer Robert Townsend has
invested a lot of effort and energy into this production, but little of
it is well-focused.  Four editors worked on the film in
post-production, and the final offering has the confused, choppy look
of something put together by a committee.</P>
<P>     There's a message behind the silliness--you don't have to be a
superhero to stand up against the drug lords currently taking over our
cities.  If decent human beings band together, it doesn't demand
someone who can leap buildings to clean up the streets.  It's a
worthwhile thing for a movie to say, but Townsend gets a little too
preachy about it.  Subtlety, at least in this case, is not one of THE
METEOR MAN's qualities.</P>
<P>     Normally in a movie of this kind, you don't worry too much about
characterization.  However, when Townsend decides to introduce dramatic
elements into his story, the film comes to need men and women who are
more than comic-book caricatures.  They aren't there, however.  There
isn't anyone in this movie that simulates a real human being.  Even
Townsend's Jefferson, with by far the greatest screen time of anyone,
fails to display more than a couple of carefully-contrived emotions.</P>
<P>     Some elements of the storyline are annoying.  It's impossible to
explain why, after discovering his superpowers, Jefferson doesn't go
out immediately and get rid of the bad guys.  In fact, his father
(played by Robert Guillaume) advises that he do just that.  But
Jefferson dawdles around while his mother makes him a costume,
occasionally knocking off a few token Golden Lords and letting the
running time of the film move towards acceptable motion picture
levels.  The entire manner in which Meteor Man confronts the villains
is inexplicable.  A battle that should be one-sided and quickly ended
turns into a an all-out war with the superhero made into the underdog
by a plot contrivance.</P>
<P>     There are a few funny scenes in the film, and at least one running
gag that works (look at James Earl Jones' always-changing wigs).
Towards the end, positioned right in the middle of the climactic battle
between Jefferson and the leader of the Golden Lords, is a truly
hilarious moment that, despite its odd placement, is worth mentioning.
If THE METEOR MAN had boasted more such scenes, it would have been far
less tiresome to watch.</P>
<P>     No one can deny that Robert Townsend had good intentions when he
put THE METEOR MAN together, but the final product doesn't have
consistency or coherence.  With its positive message and lack of
serious violence, this is a reasonable choice for a children's film,
but something of a lame offering for adults.  There's not enough of any
one element--comedy, satire, drama, or action--and the mixture isn't
any more palatable than the individual ingredients.  THE METEOR MAN is
a superhero movie that lacks punch.</P>
