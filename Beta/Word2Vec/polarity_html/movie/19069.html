INSOMNIA (director: Erik Skjoldbjærg; cast: Stellan Skarsgård (Jonas
Engström), Sverre Anker Ousdal (Erik Vik), Bjørn Floberg (Jon Holt),
Gisken Armand (Hilde Hagen), Maria
Bonnevie (Ane), Marianne O. Ulrichsen (Froya), Bjørn Moan (Eilert),
Maria Mathiesen (Tanja), Norway-1997)</P>
<P>A pretty 17-year-old girl Tanja (Maria Mathiesen) is murdered in the
land of the midnight-sun, in a remote northern town of Norway, where the
sun never sets in the summer. Two expert homicide detectives arrive to
help in the case. What makes this story different from others of this
ilk, aside from the rarity of such a film coming out of Norway and being
seen in America, is that one of the detectives, the brilliant Jonas
Engstrom (Stellan Skarsgard), an exiled Swedish policeman, now working
in Oslo, has charges against him that he had very intimate conversations
with a key witness. He is still handicapped with untreated psychological
problems. What happens to him here is even worse, as he accidently
shoots his partner Erik Vik (Anker Ousdal) when a trap they set goes
awry, and he spends the rest of the film trying to cover-up this
fatality.</P>
<P>The story follows the brooding detective, who seems to be deeply
troubled about personal matters and suffers from lack of sleep. How he
performs as a detective is chillingly played out in the company of the
Norwegian police, who look up to him for his professionalism and the
emotionless manner in which he handles the assignment. That is, except
for a women investigator, Ane (Bonnevie), who intuitively suspects that
he is not all that he is supposed to be.</P>
<P>It is a bizarre murder since the killer washed the girl's hair and
clothes and left no fingerprints, and did not sexually assault her. Two
suspects are investigated by the police. The former boyfriend Eilert
(Bjørn), who happened to break up with Tanja the night of her murder, at
a party they attended. When the police are questioning him, clues arise
pointing to another suspect, a writer (Jon Holt), who the detective
believes is the older man she was seeing. When examining her wardrobe
the detective finds dresses that he is sure she couldn't afford to get
on her own or from Eilert.</P>
<P>A trap is set for the killer when the victim's knapsack is found in a
remote shed. But the killer eludes the trap through police incompetence,
by knowing that there was a trap door in the shed and fleeing into the
foggy fjords before the police can apprehend him. This is where Engstrom
shot his partner.</P>
<P>The murder mystery itself turns out to be no great mystery, as the
expert detective quickly zeroes in on the killer. But the detective's
strangely aggressive behavior with young women is frightening to behold,
something that he can't seem to control. In one incident the flirtatious
girlfriend of Tanja's, Froya (Ulrichsen), is sexually groped by him.
This is something the killer understands that he has is in common with
the detective, as they conspire to frame the innocent suspect in the
crime.</P>
<P>Skarsgard's chilling performance does a pyschological number on his
character, and the mysterious and soberly colorful Norwegian atmosphere
gives this film an appealing flavor, allowing it to appear as if were a
noir film. This more than makes up for the less than appealing story
line. It is worth a look, if for no other reason, than to see how a
murder is handled in a beautiful and idyllic country such as Norway. But
this film has more to offer than that; it seriously questions police
conduct and authority, as it leaves a very damaging message, something
that is hard to ignore about authority figures the world-over:
questioning if the police are mentally fit for the work they do.</P>
