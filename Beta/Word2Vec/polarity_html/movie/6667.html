<P>     TURBULENCE is an interesting case of the kind of baby steps Hollywood
takes when it comes to making women equal players in the movie business.
Ten years ago, Sigourney Weaver proved in ALIENS that a woman could carry
a large-scale action film; since then, things have gone from bad to worse
for women in action films.  With TURBULENCE we finally get an entry in the
well-worn "terror in a confined space" genre which features a woman as the
central protagonist -- not just as a ready-for-kidnapping love interest --
and she can't even get first billing ahead of Ray Liotta.  Of course
Lauren Holly is hardly a familiar face or name, which begs the question of
why she received such a plum role.  That is only one of the places
TURBULENCE, a thriller with unique and sometimes compelling rhythms,
misses its chance to be something special.</P>
<P>     Holly stars as Teri Halloran, an airline flight attendant working a
New York-to-Los Angeles Christmas eve flight with only a handful of
passengers.  Ordinarily that would mean a quiet and uneventful flight,
except that two of the passengers are prisoners in federal custody,
including convicted serial killer Ryan Weaver (Liotta).  A charmer who
protests that he was framed by an over-zealous cop (Hector Elizondo),
Weaver begins to win Teri's trust, and appears to save the day when the
other prisoners escapes and kills the federal marshals and the flight
crew.  With no one left to fly the plane to safety, and a massive storm
ahead, Teri seems to be the only chance the surviving passengers have of
getting to Los Angeles alive.  That chance becomes a lot slimmer when
Weaver shows his true colors, and decides that going down in flaming
wreckage is more appealing that a long wait on death row.</P>
<P>     The opening minutes of TURBULENCE make it clear that scripter
Jonathan Brett and director Robert Butler are in full "cut to the chase"
mode.  Our knowledge of Teri as a character consists of the fact that her
fiancee just dumped her, which in turn is infinitely more than we know
about any other character on the plane.  The five civilian passengers each
get ten seconds of exposition before they are trundled off to a closet for
the rest of the film, but it is just as well they were out of the way.
TURBULENCE works best as a physical and psychological mano-a-mano between
Teri and Weaver, with the 747 turning into a careening Winchester Mystery
House of mysterious passageways.  Butler gives much of the first half of
TURBULENCE an effective tension; the atmosphere is surprisingly creepy,
with lightning and Christmas tree lights turning the central confrontation
between Teri and Weaver into something more unsettling than the pedestrian
script could muster on its own.</P>
<P>     Ray Liotta is an interesting villain through that scene, insisting on
his innocence as he works at getting inside Teri's head.  It is a casually
seductive portrayal by Liotta, and sets up a scenario where the hero will
have to outsmart the intelligent antagonist, since as a woman it is less
likely that she will be able to overpower him physically.  Unfortunately,
we already know from the idiotically revelatory ad campaign not only that
Weaver is in fact guilty as charged, but also that he is going to turn
into a bug-eyed, tongue-waggling loon.  Liotta tramples the mid-air
scenery swigging champagne from the bottle, swinging an axe around,
tossing off glib quips and generally doing his best audition for the role
of the Joker if the BATMAN series decides to revive him and Nicholson is
unavailable.  So much for a battle of the minds.</P>
<P>     It is a strange decision for many reasons, but primarily because the
film spends so much time establishing how bright Teri is.  Lauren Holly's
performance doesn't contribute all that much to that perception; she's
feisty enough, but she seems to be going through the motions when the
script gives her a shot at Weaver, and it is hard not to be reminded of
Julie Haggerty's thin-voiced flight attendant from AIRPLANE! when Holly
has to struggle with the auto-pilot.  No, Teri's smarts are revealed in a
series of scenes in which a British pilot (Ben Cross) talks her through
the landing  process.  Those scenes, far longer and more technical than
you might expect, could have anxious action fans fidgeting in their seats,
but the simple competence of Cross's tones give them a steady, gripping
tempo.  Rachel Ticotin is similarly strong in the similarly miniscule role
of an air traffic controller, radiating the kind of intelligence the role
of Teri really needs.  In fact, if TURBULENCE was going to give us a
female hero, it could have gone the extra step and given us one as strong
as Ticotin.  Go one step still further and make Cross the sly, seductive
villain, and you really could have had something.  TURBULENCE may be a
better than average adrenaline shot, but it's still basically business as
usual, even with no Arnold or Sly or Jean-Claude.</P>
