<P>     In addition to a vast array of benefits, the industrialization of 
this planet has brought with it numerous problems.  Chemicals, 
pesticides, and poisons are everywhere; pollutants clog the air.  Most 
of us adjust, breathing in fumes with little more than a distasteful 
crinkling of the nose.  There are those, however -- home-makers, mainly 
-- who suddenly and inexplicably become allergic to the 20th century.  
Afflicted with a malady called "environmental illness", a condition 
claimed to be psychosomatic by many doctors, these women and men suffer 
an immunity system breakdown that destroys their ability to enjoy 
contemporary urban life.  To survive, they must seek the quiet solace of 
an out-of-the-way retreat where they can find a "safe room" and "clear" 
the poisons from their body. </P>
<P>     Carol White (Julianne Moore) is one such woman.  Once a content 
wife and mother in the San Fernando Valley, she can no longer cope with 
her environment.  Car fumes cause her to choke, her new perm gives her 
nosebleeds, and she experiences a shortness of breath after eating 
certain foods.  Conventional medicine is stumped, and her husband, Greg 
(Xander Berkeley), is losing patience with an illness that has no 
apparent cause.  Eventually, Carol's quest for a cure leads her to a 
doctor who runs tests for environmental illness.  After she is diagnosed 
as a victim, she enrolls in a wellness retreat in New Mexico called the 
Wrenwood Center -- a community of similar sufferers. </P>
<P>     Director Todd Haynes (POISON) had a dual reason for making SAFE.  
First, he wanted to fashion a satire of the modern-day, "yuppie" 
lifestyle -- a target ripe for skewering.  Secondly, it was his 
intention to film a drama about the pain of environmental illness and 
the horrors of being treated at a place where feel-good therapy and 
group sessions are seen as the lone solution.  Unfortunately, these two 
purposes are frequently in conflict.  Haynes does an excellent job 
lampooning the shallow lifestyles of his protagonists, but the dramatic 
elements of the film don't work effectively in this caustic atmosphere.  
Several straight scenes cross over the line into self-parody.  There's a 
fair amount of unintentional humor sprinkled among that which was 
scripted. </P>
<P>     Julianne Moore (SHORT CUTS, NINE MONTHS) gives a standout 
performance as the afflicted housewife, even though her character is 
little more than a thinly-drawn caricature.  Carol doesn't come across 
as a real person -- she's another spoke in the wheel of Haynes' satire, 
a stereotype who decorates the house for her family, "does lunch" with 
her best friend, and endures her husband's insensitive lovemaking.  
Until her debilitating affliction is manifested, a crisis is when the 
furniture store delivers the wrong color couch.  Carol's shallowness is 
one of the reasons why the director's dramatic efforts fall short.  
Without a fully-realized central character to care about, it's difficult 
to develop much sympathy for her tragic situation. </P>
<P>     Haynes takes more than one jab at the kind of therapy that requires 
everyone to sit in a circle and expel their "negative impulses."  
Although he cleverly camouflages Carol's trip to the Wrenwood Center as 
the "cure" portion of the movie, his intentions are never to provide the 
happy resolution common to the "disease of the week" TV movie.  Instead, 
he fires off a viciously satirical volley at this entire wellness 
process by showing how Carol's physical condition continues to 
deteriorate even as she embraces the views of her new community. </P>
<P>     Although the major characters in SAFE are heterosexual, Haynes, an 
openly homosexual film maker, states that he believes this to be a "gay 
film."  It is, he says, an expression of his own thoughts and ideals, 
all of which are shaped by his sexual identity.  Indeed, it isn't much 
of a stretch to see parallels between environmental illness and AIDS, 
and the director doesn't hesitate to put the screws to that portion of 
society best known for expressions of homophobia. </P>
<P>     Certainly, SAFE does not succeed at everything it attempts.  The 
film is overlong and there are times when more aggressive editing might 
have improved the pace.  However, despite certain dramatic shortcomings, 
SAFE is an insightful and darkly comical social commentary.  There's a 
lot of fodder for thought, both about the human capacity for foolishness 
in creating a world where this sort of disease can occur, and about 
society's views of those who fall victim to it.  SAFE takes risks, and 
that daring alone makes it worthwhile viewing.  With a perspective 
reminiscent of the films of Michael Tolkin (THE RAPTURE, THE NEW AGE), 
this picture is an independent movie in the truest sense of the word -- 
not simply because of who distributes it, but because of what it says 
and how it chooses to get that message across. </P>
