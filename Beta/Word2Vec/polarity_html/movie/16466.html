<PRE>BUFFALO ‘66 by DeWyNGaLe    Rating: B</PRE>
<P>Buffalo ‘66 is a very rarely known movie that stars Vincent Gallo and Christina
Ricci.  Gallo plays a very troubled man, who was sent to jail for gambling. 
Once out of jail, he must visit his parents, who he told he was married.  The
truth is he isn't married.  To try to impress them, he kidnaps a girl
(Christina Ricci) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife.  The film is
very cheaply made, and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie, but you don't
need money to make a good film.  Buffalo ‘66 doesn't always stay with the
realistic concept, and sometimes goes through outrageous events.</P>
<P>Gallo's parents, played by Angelica Huston and Ben Gazarra, are two very
strange individuals.  The mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays
a quiet man with odd habits.  Gallo and Ricci arrive at his parent's house, and
some extremely funny scenes take place within the house.  Ricci's performance
during the scene at Gallo's parent's home are very well done.  There is
constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes.  The way the
movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and
creative.  They seemed very mediocre, but they worked out just fine.</P>
<P>Gallo's character is developed very well.  The impression that he is very
depressed and confused is very clear.  Gallo gives a performance that makes you
believe what the character is going through.  His character goes through many,
many problems, just like many people in real life.  This character seemed very
realistic to me.  Ricci's character is funny and different.  She doesn't care
much that she has been kidnaped, in fact, she falls in love the man who
kidnaped her!  Ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the
recognition that she deserves.</P>
<P>Buffalo ‘66 isn't all laughs though.  Many scenes are very dramatic and
depressing.  Gallo's character was so realistic, he was extremely disturbing. 
Some scenes are supposed to come off as funny, but they actually seemed sad and
real to life.  The film sometimes drags along, not giving much material.  I
really would have liked to see Gallo's parents a lot more, and I would have
liked to see the characters developed more.  Overall, Buffalo ‘66 isn't as good
as some people put it up to be.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- A few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the
bottom.</P>
