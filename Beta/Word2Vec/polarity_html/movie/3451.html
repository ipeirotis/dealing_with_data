<P>     THE BOSTONIANS.  A ROOM WITH A VIEW.  MR. AND MRS. BRIDGE.  HOWARDS
END.  THE REMAINS OF THE DAY.  These represent the best of Merchant-
Ivory--a category in which their latest, JEFFERSON IN PARIS, does not
belong.  Nevertheless, although this examination of several years in the
life of Thomas Jefferson (the U.S. minister to France between 1784 and
1789) is flawed, it nevertheless represents two-plus hours of diverting
melodrama.  The historical accuracy of certain plot points may be in
doubt, but this certainly isn't the first motion picture "based on a true
story" to play loose with the facts.</P>
<P>     Nick Nolte looks like Thomas Jefferson, and his deserved reputation
as a fine actor further argues in his favor as the perfect choice for the
title role.  Inexplicably, however, Nolte is actually rather flat.  As
was the case with Robert Duvall in HBO's STALIN, the part seems to
smother him.  He's adequate, but no emoting is involved, and there are
many sequences where Jefferson comes across as stiff and lifeless.  Nolte
never successfully forges a bond between his character and the audience.</P>
<P>     The whole film is rather superficial.  It tells its story reasonably
well, but doesn't do much more.  Considering that this picture comes from
Merchant-Ivory, the producer-director team that has given us a number of
multi-layered films, the lack of depth is disappointing.  JEFFERSON IN
PARIS is just another MASTERPIECE THEATER-style costume drama.</P>
<P>     There are four principle storylines developing in parallel
throughout the movie.  The first relates to Jefferson's burgeoning
friendship/romance with painter Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi).  The second
follows the changes in his relationship with one of his slaves, fifteen-
year old Sally Hemings (Thandie Newton).  Another examines the jealous
reactions of his daughter Patsy (Gwyneth Paltrow) to his mistresses.  The
final, and potentially most interesting, is an observation of the
political events leading up to the French Revolution, and how Jefferson
reacts to these.</P>
<P>     In JEFFERSON IN PARIS, it's the secondary performers who impress.
Thandie Newton (FLIRTING) brings life and vibrancy to Sally (although
there is one horribly over-the-top scene where she dances for Jefferson
in the privacy of his bed chamber).  Gwyneth Paltrow, who was excellent
in her FLESH AND BONE debut, gives a multi-dimensionality to a character
conflicted by love, commitment, and jealousy.  Simon Callow (FOUR
WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL) has a delightful turn as the gay husband of
Scacchi's Maria.</P>
<P>     When it comes to issues, JEFFERSON IN PARIS is feeble and fumbling.
After introducing the ironic hypocrisy of Jefferson's having written a
document claiming that "all men are created equal" while nevertheless
maintaining a significant contingent of slaves, little more of substance
is presented on the subject.  Equally given short shrift is the ideology
underlying the French Revolution.  Aside from a few brief discussions
filled with facile arguments, this particular element of the plot seems
designed more as an historical backdrop than anything else.</P>
<P>     Impressions of JEFFERSON IN PARIS are likely to be based largely
upon expectations.  Those anticipating something with the depth and
breadth of a HOWARDS END will be disappointed.  Regardless, though it may
be occasionally slow-moving and perhaps a half-hour too long, this film
is put together with care and a mindfulness of quality.  Little here is
exceptional, but, fortunately, less is below par.  In the end, like QUEEN
MARGOT or 1776, JEFFERSON IN PARIS serves as a snapshot of history and
the characters that made their mark upon it.</P>
