<P>     GOING ALL THE WAY, based on Dan Wakefield's 1970 bestselling novel 
of the same name, is a coming of age story with characters who are a 
little older than is the norm for this genre.  While most stories about 
the rituals of entering adulthood are set in high schools, GOING ALL THE 
WAY looks at two twentysomething men who, having served during the 
Korean War, are fresh out of the army and trying to find their place in 
the world.  And, since the movie is set in 1954, it addresses the roles 
of religion and sex in the rites of passage -- this is, after all, an 
era when the latter was taboo and the former was de rigueur.  </P>
<P>     Sonny (Jeremy Davies) and Gunner (Ben Affleck) are an unusual pair 
of close friends.  Although both attended the same high school and each 
joined the army after graduation, that's where the similarity ends.  
Sonny is a shy, alienated young man who comes from a deeply conservative 
family and who gets tongue-tied around pretty girls.  His war experience 
was limited to guarding the home front from Kansas City.  Gunner, on the 
other hand, is an ex-jock who spent time in Korea and Japan.  He's 
popular, well-liked, and can get any girl he wants.  His mother (Lesley 
Ann Warren), a swinging bachelorette, treats him more like a boyfriend 
than a son.  Yet, one day while talking, Sonny and Gunner realize that, 
despite the differences in their personalities and backgrounds, they 
have very similar concerns and questions about life, love, and the 
future.  The two become inseparable, but, although their friendship is 
real, it is not a match of equals.  The brash and confident Gunner is 
the leader and Sonny is always the follower.</P>
<P>     Women are, of course, the unsolved (and perhaps unsolvable) 
mystery.  Gunner falls for a sexy art student named Marty (Rachel Weisz, 
sporting an unbelievably irritating faux American accent), while Sonny 
is looking for a way out of a dead-end relationship with his high school 
sweetheart, the loyal-but-uninteresting Buddy (Amy Locane).  He finds 
his escape in Gale (Rose McGowan), but learns the hard way that dream 
girls are sometimes better left in dreams.</P>
<P>     Kurt Vonnegut once described Dan Wakefield's novel, GOING ALL THE 
WAY, as "the Midwestern CATCHER IN THE RYE," and, while the film doesn't 
have quite the depth one might expect from a story tagged with that 
appellation, it's easy to see why Vonnegut made the comparison.  GOING 
ALL THE WAY deals believably with the tribulations of new adulthood and 
the youthful need to break free in a world that seeks to repress.  Many 
male viewers, regardless of the era they grew up in, will see bits and 
pieces of themselves in Sonny and Gunner.</P>
<P>     The movie, adapted by Wakefield and directed by MTV alum and first 
time feature filmmaker Mark Pellington, is at times uneven.  GOING ALL 
THE WAY contains elements of comedy ranging from subtle humor to blatant 
satire (most of the latter involve a scathing view of religion and 
conservatism in the '50s).  Not all of these blend seamlessly with the 
movie's more dramatic elements, and several of the comic-to-serious 
transitions are jarring (such as the tragedy that follows closely upon 
Sonny's surreal trip into a fundamentalist church where he asks 
directions to a whore house).  </P>
<P>     The women in the film function mostly as plot devices and 
attractive decorations.  None of them have any personality or depth.  
Jill Clayburgh and Lesley Ann Warren , as Sonny and Gunner's mothers, 
respectively, are stereotypes.  They are used to provide humor and 
emphasize the differences and, perhaps surprisingly, the similarities 
between religious conservatism and progressive liberalism.  The younger 
actresses -- Rachel Weisz (SWEPT FROM THE SEA), Amy Locane (CARRIED 
AWAY), and Rose McGowan (SCREAM) -- are on hand primarily to act as 
catalysts and to look pretty, whether clothed or topless.  </P>
<P>     Fortunately, the two leads are well-developed and ably portrayed.  
Ben Affleck (CHASING AMY) has the blend of charm and bravado necessary 
to bring Gunner to life.  His co-star, Jeremy Davies (who can also be 
seen in THE LOCUSTS), plays a character not unlike the one he essayed in 
SPANKING THE MONKEY.  Davies has an aptitude for fleshing out insecure 
individuals who have been dealt a raw hand by fate, and, as a result, 
are forever trapped.  The rapport established between Affleck and Davies 
is effective -- it's not difficult to accept that these two mismatched 
young men have become fast friends.</P>
<P>     Because of the nature of the material, GOING ALL THE WAY will 
probably appeal more to males than females, although, as with any well-
constructed motion picture, there's nothing to prevent a woman from 
enjoying it.  However, while the novel may have been an important and 
influential work of literature, the motion picture adaptation doesn't 
ascend to the same lofty heights.  GOING ALL THE WAY is a pleasant way 
to spend one-hundred minutes, and the characters are fashioned with 
enough detail for us to care about them, but this is in no way a seminal 
or transforming movie.  The only thing that sets it apart from so many 
forgettable period piece coming-of-age stories is that it has been put 
together with a degree of care and skill.</P>
