<PRE>                                 LAMERICA
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     LAMERICA is a bleak picture about modern day Albania, which is an
oxymoron.  The Albania shown in this film, which I have no reason to
believe is inaccurate, is a dreary place of abject poverty - sort of
the antithesis of a vacation haven.  Shows about measurable conditions
can be interesting and rewarding.  Consider TAXI DRIVER, TO LIVE,
GERMINAL, BRAZIL, and STALINGRAD among others.  LAMERICA's purpose, on
the other hand, seems to be to shock us with the poverty while weaving
an opaque tale.</P>
<P>     The show starts promisingly with great old newsreel footage of the
Italians taking over impoverished Albania in the 1930s.  They merged
the countries for the duration of the war.</P>
<P>     The film then switches to 1991 in Albania when the chains of
Communism are finally broken.  This means that foreigners are free to
come in and bring their money, but since most of the same corrupt
politicians are in power, Albanian buses are stopped at the borders to
prevent Albanians from leaving.  The show has a plethora of scenes of
the staring masses either charging for food donations like animals of
sitting around staring at the strange foreigners with morbid
fascination.</P>
<P>     Into this land of despair comes two Italian con men named Fiore
(Michele Placido) and his assistant Gino (Enrico Lo Verso who was
excellent in FARINELLI).  Their specialty is taking money from the
Italian government ostensibly for relief work for building factories in
third world countries.  They skim most of the money off of the top and
use the rest to buy a little equipment for the factories.</P>
<P>     Their last company was in Nigeria where their specialty was not
building televisions sets.  They never even built one, but they
couldn't be held accountable if those Nigerians did not prove to be
successful television set factory workers.</P>
<P>     In Albania they go looking for an anti-Communist hero to appoint
as the titular head of their shell company.  They search in an
ex-prison that has been turned into an old age home.  The old age homes
are dark and worse than most concentration camp pictures I have seen.
The people all have a quarter of an inch of caked on dirt, they walk
like zombies from a low budget horror picture, and many have missing
limbs.  The con men find a senile, 80 year old named Spiro Tozai,
a.k.a. Michele Talarico (Carmelo Di Mazzarelli), who says he is 20, and
they make him the chairman of their firm.  The film is by director
Gianni Amelio, who did the unusual STOLEN CHILDREN, and the influence
from that film shows in the old age home scene.</P>
<P>     The script by Gianni Amelio, Andrea Porporati, and Alessandro
Sermoneta is overly earnest and not very memorable, but it does have
one good line I remember.  When Gino is at the big hotel in Albania, he
tells his Albanian contact Selimi (Piro Milkani) that he is going to
take a shower.  Selimi gives him that not-in-this-country-you-don't
look, and explains, "Sorry.  No water today.  Today holiday.  Maybe
tomorrow."</P>
<P>     The rest of the show focuses in on Gino chasing Spiro as he tries
to escape to Italy.  The other part of the plot is that Spiro has a
fairly easy to guess secret which Gino finds out about.  The show can
be quite mean spirited as young kids, about age 7, steal Spiro's shoes
and then put him in a hut where they try to torture and asphyxiate him
with torches and smoke.  They do not manage to kill him, but they come
close. I was not impressed with any of the acting, but Carmelo Di
Mazzarelli's performance was the most obscure and least effective of
the bunch.</P>
<P>     LAMERICA runs way too long at 1:55.  It is in Italian and some
Albanian, all with English subtitles.  The film is not rated.  Given
some of the strong images and the adult themes, it would probably get
an R, but perhaps it could qualify for a PG-13.  It would be fine for
any teenager.  This is the sort of art house film with which many
critics and art house patrons resonate.  To me, however, it is nothing
more than a chronology of poverty without a compelling script.  I know
the writers and director wanted me to feel sorry for the Albanians.  I
do.  More than that, I see little purpose in the film.  You can
overpraise a bad artistic film and no one will care, but dislike an
earnest one like this, and people are up in arms over the critic's
"stupidity."  I once gave a mediocre review to BURNT BY THE SUN, and I
think half the Russians in the world wrote me unflattering letters.
Finally, I give the film * 1/2 for its seriousness.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
