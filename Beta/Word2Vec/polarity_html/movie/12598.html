<P>     It's too bad the title THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY was already 
taken, because it would have been the perfect moniker for FEAR AND 
LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, Terry Gilliam's adaptation of Hunter S. 
Thompson's book (emphasis on "the bad and the ugly" part).  It's always 
a risky endeavor to fashion a motion picture based on an "unfilmable" 
novel -- even to try demands a director with a lion's share of chutzpah.  
Gilliam, the American member of the Monty Python troupe, certainly has 
that quality, but his efforts here have met with what can charitably be 
called mixed results.  From time-to-time, FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS 
is darn funny, but those moments of seemingly-inspired humor are more 
than offset by the rest of the movie, which is nearly unwatchable.</P>
<P>     The film's plot is thin, but then the book, which is a stream-of-
consciousness affair, is more interested in making pithy observations 
and developing a tone than in presenting a narrative.  One thing Gilliam 
does well is to capture Thompson's style and unleash it on the screen.  
However, I'm not sure that's a good thing.  After all, there is a reason 
why books are books and movies are movies, and FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS 
VEGAS makes a pretty good case that the two don't always mix.</P>
<P>     Back to the storyline:  Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), who is a 
fictional representation of the book's protagonist, author Thompson, is 
headed to Las Vegas in the company of his "Samoan lawyer," Dr. Gonzo 
(Benicio Del Toro, looking more bloated than Robert De Niro in the 
closing moments of RAGING BULL).  The year is 1971, and Duke's 
ostensible reason for the journey is to cover the $50,000 Mint 400 
Desert Race, but his real motivation seems to be to see how many Vegas 
hotel rooms he can trash and how many different concoctions of grass, 
cocaine, alcohol, uppers, mescaline, and acid he can imbibe.  After 
being attacked by hallucinatory bats during the trek across the desert, 
the pair arrives on the strip before the end of the first reel, checks 
into their room, and spends the rest of the movie getting stoned and 
taking the audience on a bizarre visual journey that would make Oliver 
Stone proud.</P>
<P>     I'm sure the idea of the film is to give the viewer the sense of 
inhabiting Duke's shoes -- that's what all the weird angles, distorted 
shots, and red lighting are for.  However, being in a theater watching a 
couple of wasted characters is not anything like being under the 
influence of a mind-altering drug (or so I'm told).  It doesn't take 
long for the movie-goer to recognize all of the visual trickery as a 
gimmick designed to camouflage the fact that the film doesn't go 
anywhere:  the plot is repetitious and the protagonist is a lifeless 
caricature.</P>
<P>     In this picture, the narrator has more lines than the characters.  
This is one of those rare movies when the technique of having a narrator 
works, primarily because every amusing or insightful comment made during 
the far-too-long running length is contained in the voiceover.  Here's 
where we learn that the message behind FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS is 
to illustrate how 1971 was a turning point in the drug culture -- the 
year that the innocence and empowerment of the late '60s turned rancid, 
leaving users burned-out and broken instead of free and flying high.  As 
one might expect, Gilliam also takes a few corrosive shots at middle-
class America.  The most obvious of these occurs during the film's 
funniest sequence:  an anti-drug "information session" attended by Duke, 
Gonzo, and dozens of white bread, out-of-uniform cops.</P>
<P>     Johnny Depp is the kind of actor who always seems willing to try 
something new.  During his uneven career, he has played everything from 
Edward Scissorhands to Donnie Brasco.  As Duke, Depp gives a wonderful 
physical performance with no emotional depth.  He has the rubber-legged 
actions of his character right ("a total loss of motor skills... a loss of 
communication with the spinal column"), but doesn't give us any reason 
to care about Duke.  He's like Steve Martin in THE JERK, only much, much 
less inspired.  Meanwhile, the most impressive thing about Benicio Del 
Toro is how thoroughly he manages to hide his good looks beneath hair, 
rolls of fat, and drying bodily fluids.  Christina Ricci, the excellent 
young actress who is continuing her quest to re-shape her image from 
cute to tawdry (see also THE ICE STORM, and the yet-to-be-released 
BUFFALO 66 and THE OPPOSITE OF SEX), has a small role as an artist 
named Lucy.  There are other cameos as well, including Gary Busey, Ellen 
Barkin, Mark Harmon, and Cameron Diaz.</P>
<P>     One criticism that has been leveled against FEAR AND LOATHING IN 
LAS VEGAS is that it glorifies drug use.  I'm not sure how anyone who 
has seen the film can make that statement, since the movie reduces 
chronic users to the level of barely-functional zombies awash in 
degeneracy.  Gilliam has said that his intention was to make the film 
"ugly," and he has achieved that aim.  Visually and viscerally, there is 
a connection between FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS and TRAINSPOTTING, 
albeit with two critical differences:  the British picture developed 
real characters and didn't go on and on and on, ad nauesum, like this 
one.  </P>
<P>     While I'm not recommending the movie to anyone interested in either 
(a) mainstream entertainment, or (b) something with a coherent 
narrative, the film has the look and feel of a picture that's destined 
for cult status.  It's the kind of movie that plays at midnight showings 
during film festivals and generates a small-but-devoted legion of fans 
who attend conventions and boast about how many hundreds of times 
they've watched it.  Ultimately, however, while this die-hard group will 
call Gilliam a genius and genuflect every time his name is mentioned, 
the rest of us will recall the movie version of FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS 
VEGAS as a bad trip.</P>
