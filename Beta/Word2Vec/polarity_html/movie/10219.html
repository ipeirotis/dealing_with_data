<P>     For Robert Duvall, THE APOSTLE was a labor of love.  It is said 
that every man or woman has at least one story to tell; this is 
Duvall's.  The film was in the making for over a decade, and, when no 
studio bought into it, Duvall put up the money himself.  The actor 
filled nearly every role imaginable on this production – in addition to 
financing it, he starred in it, directed it, executive produced it, and 
wrote it.  In his cross-country publicity tour to generate interest in 
the picture, he has been both eloquent and passionate when discussing 
what this film means to him.  For Duvall, THE APOSTLE is not just a 
movie, it is *the* movie.</P>
<P>     A relatively simple tale about a far-from-simple character, THE 
APOSTLE never falters in its portrayal of Euliss "Sonny" Dewey (Duvall) 
as a real, flesh-and-blood human being.  Unlike many movies that deal 
with religion and religious figures, THE APOSTLE does not set out to 
uncover corruption and hypocrisy or to attack deeply-held beliefs.  It 
does not patronize or satirize.  It is respectful without being 
reverential.  THE APOSTLE is a character study, and, like all motion 
pictures of this sort, its ultimate success depends upon how compelling 
the protagonist is.  As essayed by Duvall, arguably one of America's 
ten-best living actors, Sonny is the kind of complex individual we could 
watch for hours on end without ever losing interest.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a brief prologue in 1939 Texas that shows 
Sonny, as a boy, at a Pentecostal church service.  THE APOSTLE then 
fast-forwards nearly six decades.  Now, Sonny is an aging preacher who 
spends most of his time on the road, leading revivals all across the 
deep South.  His long-suffering wife, Jessie (Farrah Fawcett), grows 
tired of his never being home, and wants a divorce.  The already-
uncomfortable situation is further exacerbated when Jessie and her 
lover, a young minister named Horace (Todd Allen), use church by-laws to 
steal Sonny's congregation away from him.  In a moment of jealous rage, 
Sonny attacks Horace, and the result of that confrontation forces him to 
flee his home state and change his identity.  Bearing the name and title 
of "The Apostle E.F.", he soon re-surfaces in a small bayou community in 
Louisiana with the intention of starting a Pentecostal ministry.  His 
enthusiasm is so great that a respected, local black pastor (John 
Beasley) agrees to help him.</P>
<P>     Like many flawed heroes, Sonny is a good man who is haunted by one 
tragic mistake.  His entire life becomes devoted to redemption and 
atonement.  He cannot take back what he did, but he is determined to act 
in a manner that will bring good into the lives of everyone he meets.  
Sonny has moments of weakness, but his sincerity never wavers, even when 
his ministry flourishes and the temptation for self-aggrandizement 
grows.  He is a powerful, charismatic figure with a real gift for 
preaching.  Watching Sonny lead revivals, it's easy to understand the 
appeal of an energetic preacher, and how some of the most popular 
achieve a status not unlike that of a rock star.</P>
<P>     It is a testimony to Duvall's reputation in the business that he 
was able to gather such an impressive cast for a low-budget, low-profile 
motion picture.  In addition to Duvall, key roles are filled by Farrah 
Fawcett, Miranda Richardson (as Toosie, a woman who is drawn to Sonny's 
magnetic personality), country star June Carter Cash (as Sonny's 
mother), John Beasley, and Billy Bob Thornton (as a racist 
troublemaker).  These five actors, not to mention the rest of the 
troupe, are in top form, but none steals the spotlight from Duvall, who 
is truly at the height of his powers as Sonny.  In his long and 
distinguished career, only his Oscar-winning performance in 1983's 
TENDER MERCIES was this raw.  Duvall becomes Sonny.  The energy and 
passion of a preacher are all present.</P>
<P>     Duvall has devoted a great deal of time and effort into getting the 
details right.  To enhance THE APOSTLE's verisimilitude, he relied 
primarily on non-professional church-goers and evangelists (rather than 
experienced actors) in supporting roles.  For the picture's style, he 
admits to being inspired by the near-documentary quality of Ken Loach's 
films.  As a result, THE APOSTLE possesses a truer and more intimate 
feel than it would have with slick camerawork.  Warts and all, Sonny's 
character shines through clearly as he struggles to find a path that has 
meaning.  THE APOSTLE is not the kind of movie that provokes a profound 
change in the viewer, but it offers a balanced portrait of a unique 
personality.  Sonny is not easily forgotten and, when the Oscar 
nominations are announced, it's possible that Duvall won't be, either.</P>
