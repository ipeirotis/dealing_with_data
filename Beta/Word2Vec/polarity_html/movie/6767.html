<P>     In case you were unclear on this point, FIERCE CREATURES is _not_
technically a sequel to A FISH CALLED WANDA...though for the life of me I
can't figure out why that was the case.  It isn't as though John Cleese
had a radically different idea in mind for reuniting the four principal
cast members.  Cleese again plays a flustered authority figure; Kevin
Kline again plays a libidinous boor; Jamie Lee Curtis again plays a tough
bombshell who uses Kline and seduces Cleese; Michael Palin again plays an
animal lover with a distinctive speech pattern.  A great deal of effort
went into reminding you why you might have enjoyed A FISH CALLED WANDA,
and then FIERCE CREATURES only delivers halfway.  Though buoyed by a
couple of wildly farcical set pieces, FIERCE CREATURES often feels like a
film in search of an identity.</P>
<P>     FIERCE CREATURES opens in Atlanta, where Octopus Inc., run by
multi-billionaire communications tycoon Rod McCain (Kline), has just 
acquired a company which owns a small British zoo.  Determined to make the
zoo just as profitable as his other subsidiaries, McCain assigns former
police chief Rollo Lee (Cleese) the job of whipping the place into shape.
Rollo's plan is to weed out the tamest of the animals, leaving only the
most vicious beasts to attract customers, a plan which outrages staff
members like zookeeper Bugsy (Palin).  The zoo does begin to make more
money, but a couple of opportunistic Octopus employees hope for even
bigger things.  Marketing whiz Willa Weston (Curtis) hopes to create a zoo
franchise which will make her career, while McCain's ne'er-do-well son
Vince (also played by Kline) hopes to line his pockets with the zoo's
profits while turning it into a giant billboard.</P>
<P>     I don't blame the makers of FIERCE CREATURES for making its main
characters so similar to those in WANDA, because they were simply
following a time-honored tradition for recurring comic teams.  From Abbott
and Costello through Spade and Farley, it has been understood that it is
important for roles to be defined.  Id is id and ego is ego and never the
twain should meet; what would the audience make of it if Curly suddenly
began to browbeat Moe?  The problem with FIERCE CREATURES isn't that its
characters are familiar, it is that they are just familiar enough to be
disappointing.  Cleese does the put-upon bit, but he's not put-upon
_enough_; Kline does the dense bit, but he's not dense _enough_.  The
foursome found a dynamic in A FISH CALLED WANDA which worked to
perfection, and there are at least a few references in FIERCE CREATURES
intended to capitalize on that goodwill.  The script simply leaves you
waiting on several occasions, waiting for it to take an extra comedic step
which doesn't come.</P>
<P>     WANDA also featured the delightful sub-text of the clash between
British and American cultures, and FIERCE CREATURES chooses corporate
avarice and gross commercialism as its satirical targets.  Yet there too
the script by Cleese and Iain Johnstone is disappointingly half-hearted
with its jabs.  The ruthless tycoon played by Kline is clearly modeled
after Ruppert Murdoch, yet he escapes with no more interesting a character
trait than occasional flatulence; the outrageous possibilities of a zoo
with a ton of corporate sponsors yield some amusing results (particularly
the zoo uniforms covered in more labels than a stock car), but there is no
major payoff.  It is surprising primarily because Cleese did a funnier and
more concise job of skewering advertising in the Schwepps spot which
accompanied the American video release of WANDA, a spot recalled by an
advertisement Cleese wears on the back of his suit coat in CREATURES.</P>
<P>     FIERCE CREATURES does have its moments, most of them coming in the
last half hour as the zoo employees (including a soft-hearted Cleese) try
to save the zoo from closure.  There are a pair of winning scenes in the
classic farce tradition of slamming doors and near misses, one in a hotel
room and the other involving the younger McCain's attempt to impersonate
his father, yet that latter scene also reminds you of what is missing in
much of the humor in FIERCE CREATURES.  A FISH CALLED WANDA was infamous
as the film which had the audacity to make fun of dogs being killed in
unusual ways, to use stuttering as a comic device.  Until the finale of
FIERCE CREATURES, which includes a startling bit of black humor, the film
feels terribly tame.  The animals in this film aren't subjected to cruel
fates; they are photographed in all their quirky cuteness for "awww"
moments and used for sometimes amusing slapstick comedy.  Too many things
about FIERCE CREATURES feel just slightly askew, like the conflicted
results of film-makers trying both to remind you of something and to make
something completely different.  Part of that may be the result of two
directors (Robert Young and Fred Schepisi), but ultimately much of the
responsibility comes back to Cleese.  At times, his work sparks memories
not just of WANDA's outrageousness, but of classic Monty Python as well;
at other times, he seems to have softened with age.  He is just one of
several creatures in FIERCE CREATURES which isn't quite fierce enough.</P>
