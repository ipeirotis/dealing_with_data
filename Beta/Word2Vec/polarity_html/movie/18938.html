<P>By-the-numbers: A film which introduces characters, situations, dilemmas and
developments that we've seen before in a parade of other films. A film which
can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one. A film which is
packed to the cap with predictability, leading to very little tension,
excitement, suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience. In
short, a cliché-ridden formula film. Welcome to my review of THE GENERAL'S
DAUGHTER.</P>
<P>PLOT:
An undercover Army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked
inside an investigation into some bigwig General daughter's rape, torture
and murder. They must delve through all of the unspoken Army rules and the
hush-hushes, to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
By the numbers (see above). This film is just there. It sits there on the
big screen for a couple of hours, floats around, goes away, hopefully never
to be heard from again. It is so predictable that even a blind man could see
its plot points coming a mile away. It's as suspenseful as a leaf dropping
from a tree. It's as action-packed as a Canadian curling tournament. Get the
picture? I sure did...it's too bad that it took my friend and I less than
two minutes to figure out the entire plot, and to break down each scene
before it was even completed. Easy as pie. It's unfortunate because James
Woods and John Travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together
near the beginning of the film, but alas, t'was not to be (That scene alone
scored two of my four points allotted.) Woods chews it up in the few scenes
that he's in, Travolta passes the test, Cromwell plays, well, Cromwell, and
Stowe is window dressing with a smile (MIA since 12 MONKEYS (8/10) it
seems).</P>
<P>And this predictability isn't reserved only to those who have seen films
like COURAGE UNDER FIRE or A FEW GOOD MEN, it runs deep inside every one of
us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug
on the big screen. It's like riding a bike. Other scenarios which sponge out
any tension, suspense or interest from this film include every single
character eventually "breaking down" to the investigators without much
reason given, a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of
the lead characters, as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly, and
a directorial style that can only reward director Simon West with a solid
nomination for the "Best Poor Man's Michael Bay Doing his Best Poor Man's
Impression of Tony Scott" (Add two scenes with sunlight shining through some
half-open shades for grit and integrity, and an all-out rainfall for the
finale for further chaos, and you're a great director. Yawn. Yeah, whatever
Tony...I mean, Simon.)</P>
<P>And aren't we all sick of hearing about these Army "bad boys" and their
overdone "code of silence"?! Enough already! Next subject, please. See it on
video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like AN
OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN (8.5/10). Otherwise, save yourself the trouble and
go take a crap instead. You'll feel much better afterwards. Trust me.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
Ironically, John Travolta turned down the lead role in AN OFFICER AND A
GENTLEMAN, which eventually went to little Dickie Gere. Ironically on James
Woods' part, he completed one of his earliest acting roles on TV's "Welcome
Back, Kotter", starring none other than John Travolta.
Actor James Woods recently confirmed reports of his "big dick" on Howard
Stern's radio program. Unlike rocker Tommy Lee, Woods is also alleged to
have an IQ of 180. He apparently scored a perfect 800 on his verbal SATs and
a 779 on the math section. What a man!
John Travolta is married to actress Kelly Preston, and they have a son named
Jett (Travolta loves them planes!). Word on the street is that the kid was
apparently conceived during a weekend at Demi Moore and Bruce Willis' home.
Director Simon West's first film was the Jerry Bruckheimer produced CON AIR
(6.5/10). Before that, he directed TV commercials including the Budweiser ad
with the dancing ants. Yippee!
Veteran director John Frankenheimer (RONIN (7.5/10), THE MANCHURIAN
CANDIDATE) portrays the character of General Sonnenberg in this film. The
IMDb reports that when Senator Robert Kennedy was shot at the Ambassador
Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, it was his good friend John
Frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day.
Clarence Williams III, who plays Colonel Fowler in this film, is known to
some from his role as "Linc" in the original "Mod Squad" TV series. Younger
folk may remember him as Prince's father in PURPLE RAIN.</P>
