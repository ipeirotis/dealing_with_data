<PRE>                         SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Joe Mantegna, Ben Kingsley, Max Pomeranc, Laurence Fishburne.
Director/Screenwriter:  Steven Zaillian.</P>
<P>     SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER is the kind of film that can easily
get lost in the glut of summer releases.  It boasts no superstars,
includes no gunfire or velociraptors, and has as its focal point the
game of chess.</P>
<P>     Let me repeat that: a movie ... about chess.  No, let me amend
that: a wonderful movie about chess.  SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER is
an emotionally satisfying and surprisingly understated film that takes
the tried-and-true formula of such crowd pleasers as ROCKY and THE
KARATE KID and adds some welcome thematic depth.</P>
<P>     SEARCHING is based on the true story of Josh Waitzkin (Max
Pomeranc), a seven-year-old New York boy whose parents (Joe Mantegna
and Joan Allen) discover that he is a chess prodigy.  He learns the
game from park chess hustlers like Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne), who
encourages daring and aggressive play, and is then brought by his
father to former master Bruce Pandolfini (Ben Kingsley).  Pandolfini is
reluctant to act as Josh's teacher, but agrees because the price is
right and because he sees in Josh a natural talent similar to that of
the legendary American champion Bobby Fischer.  Pandolfini is also a
purist who shuns the strategies of speed players like Vinnie, and wants
to instill in Josh the calculated single-mindedness and contempt for
opponents that characterized Fischer's play.  The film then traces
Josh's experiences with the youth tournaments, and his growing fear
that once he's the best, it's no longer "okay to lose."</P>
<P>     This examination of the win-at-all-costs ethos of competition
provides one of the film's most potent thematic touchstones.  After his
baseball team wins a game in an eary sequense, Josh looks on
sympathetically as the losing team walks away dejectedly.  He loves to
play, but he doesn't love to win.  It's an attitude which infuriates
Pandolfini, who tells Josh he must hate his opponents, only to receive
the simple response, "I don't hate them."  It's also a foreign concept
to his father, a sports writer who begins to live vicariously through
his son's victories.  Sports parents are given a firm tweaking,
particularly in a hilarious scene at a tournament where a fight breaks
out between two fathers.</P>
<P>     As Fred Waitzkin, Joe Mantegna presents a fully-realized portrait
of one of these parents.  He is a loving father who initially
encourages his son's gift out of selflessness, but slowly gets caught
up in the winning.  His feelings are brought out in a confrontation
with Josh's school teacher, whom he tells, "Do you know how good he
is?  He's better at this than I've ever been at anything in my life."
Mantegna's performance is rich and effective, and only one of many
super acting turns.  Kingsley deftly handles the cold, slightly
embittered Pandolfini, allowing him to be unlikeable but
understandable.  Fishburne has fun with his small part as the
trash-talking park player, as does David Paymer as a nervous "chess
dad."  However, it's Max Pomeranc's show, and he carries it.  With his
hair hanging just above his eyes and his mouth perpetually in something
just less than a smile, first-time actor Pomeranc projects Josh's
earnestness and ever-present tension in sighs and eye movements.  It's
a delightful performance, made even more surprising by the fact that he
is being handled by a first-time director.</P>
<P>     That director is Steven Zaillian (Oscar nominated as a
screenwriter for AWAKENINGS), and it's a remarkably confident debut.
He delivers the chess scenes with tremendous energy, a challenge if
ever there was one.  He frames his scenes with a sense of purpose, and
his actors are always focused.  Most tellingly, he demonstrates the
ability to develop his story visually, beginning with the opening
sequence where Josh finds a carved chess piece, is offered a softball
in trade by Vinnie, and chooses to keep the piece.  Without a single
word of dialogue, Zaillian conveys a change in focus for Josh, and the
beginning of his new life.</P>
<P>     If there is one place to find fault, it's with the emotional
string-pulling that's common to the "competition" genre.  James
Horner's overwrought score practically screams, "Cry now!" in a manner
I had thought only John Williams had mastered.  The climax manages to
avoid cliches, however, and I have to admit that I was grinning and on
the edge of my seat along with a couple hundred fellow moviegoers.</P>
<P>     Both as intelligent cinema and rousing entertainment, SEARCHING
FOR BOBBY FISCHER is a winner not to be overlooked.  Chess ... who'd
have guessed?</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 grandmaster points: 8 points.
