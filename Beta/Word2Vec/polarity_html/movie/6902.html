<PRE>                          EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Woody Allen's musical EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU is a delightful and
infectiously happy movie.  As a film critic, I can rarely afford myself
the luxury of taking the time to see a movie twice, but I made an
exception for EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.  Why confine the pleasure to a
single setting?</P>
<P>     Allen attracts talent to his projects, but this show has even more
than normal.  Alan Alda plays liberal Democrat Bob and Goldie Hawn
plays his guilty liberal Democrat wife Steffi.  Their daughter DJ
(Natasha Lyonne), who is the narrator, explains that the difference is
that her mom's parents were rich whereas Bob's were not, hence her
mom's guilt.  Almost everyone in the picture, as in most of Allen's
films, are quite well off.  Bob and Steffi have an expensive and
extensive place in Manhattan, complete with a maid.</P>
<P>     There is a black sheep in the family.  Their son Scott (Lukas
Haas) has become a conservative Republican.  "How did I end up with a
kid on the other end of the political spectrum?"  laments Bob.  "How
did I fail?"  Woody loves poking fun at everyone.  The way Scott's
conservative values are "resolved" in the film will undoubtedly
infuriate some, but I thought it was hilarious.</P>
<P>     Steffi's best scene shows her addressing a group of prison guards
and presenting her solution to prison unrest.  She tells the stunned
guards her idea for the prisoners, "I say give them an opportunity to
decorate their own cells with their personal interior decorator."
Nothing comes of this visit other than that she makes good friends with
soon to be released prisoner Charles Ferry (Tim Roth).  This friendship
will test her resolve as a do-gooder.  Yes, you feel sorry for a
vicious criminal, but would you want daughter to marry one?</P>
<P>     Drew Barrymore is picture perfect as their innocent daughter
Skylar.  She is engaged to boyishly handsome Edward Norton as Holden.
They have many delightful scenes together including the one where she
accidentally swallows the ring he gives her.</P>
<P>     Woody is the star of the picture as Steffi's ex-husband Joe.  As
usual, Woody plays the part of someone who has trouble with
relationships.  As Joe puts it, "In a relationship, it is better to be
the leaver than the leavee."  His last relationship has gone sour and
he has been left.  "I should go to Paris and jump off of the Eiffel
Tower," he tells Steffi and Bob.  "If I took the Concorde, I could be
dead three hours earlier."  Woody plays his usual character obsessed
with death -- Mahler, but funnier.</P>
<P>     Eventually Woody will go to Venice and meet a married woman named
Von, played by the ever gorgeous Julia Roberts.  They will have an
affair that will be the centerpiece of the story.  My favorite line of
his comes after she compliments him on his love making abilities.
Being overly debonair, he confesses, "There was a moment there when I
stroked when I should have hickeyed."</P>
<P>     All of the above is great comedy, but it is the musical part that
makes the film stand out.  The film is like a traditional musical and
unlike EVITA in that the musical numbers are frequent, but most of the
lines are spoken, not sung.</P>
<P>     The musical numbers come from great old songs and are sung by the
cast.  Some of them have weak voices, with Woody's being the smallest,
but all of them manage to provide happiness and mirth.</P>
<P>     It is hard to choose which of the musical numbers I liked best.
Many of them rely on choruses.  When they are looking at the X-ray for
the lost ring, for example, the doctor breaks into song as do the
nurses and the patients.</P>
<P>     Easily the most imaginative musical number happens in the funeral
parlor.  The dead relative gets out of his casket looking exactly like
one of the ghosts from Disneyland's Haunted Mansion.  He gathers other
ghosts to sing, "Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself, it's later than you
think."  Soon Bob and Steffi and all the kids are singing and dancing
with them.</P>
<P>     The film is exceedingly beautiful, certainly the most attractive
movie Allen has ever made.  His usual cinematographer, Carlo Di Palma,
can be credited.  Talking the colors from a Central Park in fall that
has never looked lovelier, he uses that color palette for all of the
photography.  Unlike typical Allen films we also get location shots in
such picturesque locales as Paris and Venice.</P>
<P>     EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU is a joy to behold.  You leave the
theater with a song in your heart and wanting to repeat the experience
again.</P>
<P>     EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU runs 1:41.  It is rated R for a single
bad word from a rap song.  Other than that, the film is pure PG.  As
soon the rap guy appears, cover your kids ears for a few seconds and
the singer and his one profanity will be history.  With that precaution
you can take kids of any age to see the film although those under nine
will probably not be interested.  I strongly recommend the picture to
you and give it *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
