<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>At best, this TV film of Sherlock, is moderate fare. It suffers from
wooden acting, flat direction, and trite dialogue. In one scene, with
Roger Moore as Sherlock and Charlotte Rampling as Irene Adler, the only
woman the great detective ever fell in love with, he says to her: "Fear
not Irene, you shall not be long parted from your son." Now this stagy
dialogue took place in the New York of 1901, with Sherlock going after
his nemesis Professor Moriarity (John Huston), whose villainous
performance had no heart in it. It was as if Huston was reading his
lines from cue cards, which made his confrontations with Sherlock unduly
dry. They should have named this film, "Take The Money And Run."</P>
<P>What the film did have going for it, was a clever plot and a few
gimmicks it hung its hat on, which made it passably interesting for
awhile, at least enough for me to continue watching so I could see how
Sherlock resolves the complicated case he is working on. Sherlock has
just located Moriarity's hiding place in London after searching close to
a year for it and he has foiled his plans to assassinate an important
diplomat. But he now finds himself trapped in Moriarity's house, which
he foolishly went to by himself. The house is supplied with a multiple
of devices controlled by a switch that releases trap floors, causes
chandeliers to fall, and throws knives from all parts of the room.
Moriarity warns Sherlock, as he lets him leave the house unharmed, that
he is letting him go because he will pay dearly for stopping him, that
in the near future, he will commit the greatest crime of the century and
the great detective will be embarrassed in front of the whole world, as
he will be forced to tell the police that he couldn't help them without
explaining why.</P>
<P>When Sherlock receives tickets that Irene customarily sends him when she
appears in a show and these tickets are torn, Sherlock suspects foul
play afoot and takes Dr. Watson (Patrick Macnee) along with him to New
York to see the show. It is amusing to see the film's vision of New York
in 1901, with a new subway system being built underground and
horse-carriage cabs racing through the streets.</P>
<P>Sherlock's suspicions prove correct, as he discovers Irene's nine
year-old son has been kidnapped, and a note soon follows telling
Sherlock that the child will die if he helps Inspector Lafferty
(Huddleston). He soon is spotted in the street by the inspector and a
concerned looking gentleman, Mortimer McGrew (Gig), who tells him that
he is the head of the International Gold Exchange. It turns out that all
the countries in the world have their gold stored in vaults under the
Bowery Bank, which makes it easy for them when they make exchanges. But
somehow, all the gold was stolen and in three days two of the country's
have an exchange going on, and if they don't make that exchange because
all the gold is gone and this knowledge becomes public, this could lead
to a world war.</P>
<P>When Sherlock refuses to help without explaing why, the men are
flabbergasted, and Sherlock is determined to put his powers of deductive
reasoning to use and figure out how he can help the police without
getting the boy killed, as he rushes back to Irene's Grammercy Park digs
and puts his thinking cap on.</P>
<P>This is usual Sherlock stuff, except the film never had an excitement or
sense of urgency to it. Sherlock goes through the motions of wearing
disguises, coming up with brilliant deductions, and moving about in New
York as if he were a regular Dick Tracy. Any romance, seemed out of the
question, as the two stars seemed like cold kippers, afraid to even
touch each other.</P>
<P>In the end, everything seemed technically correct about the production,
but it never had any life to it. I would chalk this Sherlock version up
as a mistake and, if I were in the mood to see a Sherlock, I would stick
to seeing any of the Basil Rathbone ones of the 1940s, especially his
"Sherlock Holmes and the Spider Woman."</P>
