<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is one terrific musical, outdated or not. Jacques Demy (The
Umbrellas of Cherbourg) has created a grand work, though when this film
originally came out it was panned by some of the major film critics and
shunned by the public, but over the ensuing years it has come to be
recognized by many for the great film it is. The song and dance numbers
are playful, the story is meaningful, the performances are marvelously
refreshing, and the plush settings are very colorful. It is a film that
borrows freely from the Hollywood musical, but adds its own very French
touch of romantic spice, allowing the film to spring forth with a burst
of vibrancy. The film's musical score is an easy one to remember by
Michel Legrand, and its story is told almost exclusively by song, with
lyrics by Demy. There is also a tribute to swing music, with a large
portion of the scat music being from the likes of Louis Armstrong, Count
Basie, Duke Ellington, and Lionel Hampton. Johann Sebastian Bach is also
brought into the musical picture in a most revered way. The spirited
choreography caught my fancy, even though it probably was not as perfect
as Jerome Robbins would do, but it was a good enough imitation that was
attempted by Norman Maen. It is a film where music is everywhere, when a
fair comes to town, the pedestrians suddenly break out in a dance
number, giving the film an odd but potent touch of reality, as the film
does not aim for plausibility. Everything about this film was hopping,
there were no dead spots.</P>
<P>As in his other romantic films, Demy points out that love depends more
on chance and good timing than anything else. In this film, there are
dreams about meeting the ideal mate and yearnings about losing the one
who should have been their mate. It takes place over a long weekend,
with most of this operetta centered in the town square, which is painted
in stunning pastel shades.</P>
<P>Maxence (Perrin) is a handsome, blond sailor stationed in Rochefort, who
is finishing his tour of duty by the end of the week, after travelling
the world and being unable to locate his feminine ideal. In his spare
time he is a poet-artist. In one of his portraits, he has painted the
ideal woman and this hangs in a local gallery owned by Guillaume
(Riberolles). The gallery owner plays the heavy, a rich artist who tries
unsuccessfully to woo the lovely twin Delphine Garnier (Catherine
Deneuve). As a coincidence, the portrait painting he has hanging, is an
exact replica of what she looks like. When Delphine sees it, she is
intrigued to meet the artist, amazed that he could draw his ideal woman
sight unseen and that he has drawn her. Guillaume refuses to give her
the identity or the address of the artist, and throughout the film, the
two prospective lovers will just miss running into each other. That they
don't meet is odd, since her mother Yvonne (Danielle Darrieux) has a
refreshment stand where he hangs out, and he has even invited her to see
his painting, which she can't do because she is always busy working to
support the family.</P>
<P>Yvonne had the twins Delphine and Solange (Françoise Dorléac) from a
former lover. Ten years ago she met in Rochefort a wonderful man from
the music conservatory who had a funny name, Simon Dame (Michel
Piccoli). Just as people in real life don't marry for the silliest
reasons, she ran away from him because she didn't want to be called
Madame Dame, having a friend of hers end the relationship by telling him
she went to live in Mexico with a tycoon. He returned to Paris pining
for her love, but now after ten years he has returned to Rochefort to
open a music store, not expecting to see her again but hoping to
rekindle those happy memories by being in the spot where they met.
Unbeknownst to him, she had a child by him called Boubou (Patrick
Jeantet), who is now ten. He has never seen the twins, since they were
away in boarding school, though he knew about them, which will explain
why he doesn't recognize them when they meet.</P>
<P>The twins are first seen in a lively skit, after giving dance lessons to
a group of children they give music lessons to, as they go into a song
and dance explaining their close relationship and interests in life, and
how they feel unfulfilled living in this small coastal town in the
southwest of France, hoping to go to Paris soon. Delphine is a dancer,
Solange a composer and singer (They were real-live sisters but not twins
-- after the film Dorléac, 23, who is one year older, died in a car
accident). They change into shift dresses (terribly out of fashion in
the late '60s) and gloriously sing "We're a pair of twins, born under
the sign of Gemini/Who love catchy tunes, silly puns and repartee."</P>
<P>Solange befriends Simon in his store and when he hears what she
composes, he tells her about his American friend he attended the
conservatory with, the now famous songster who is stopping off in Paris
on his world tour, Andy Miller (Gene Kelly). He promises that he will
write to Andy and see if he can get him to give her a break. She bumps
into the middle-aged stranger in the street, but she does not know who
he is (Kelly was 55 at the time of this film -- his voice was dubbed and
he wore a toupee). When she meets Boubou after school, he has a tantrum,
knocking over her bag, but to the rescue comes Andy, as they fall in
love at first sight. She is so dazed, that she leaves her musical
composition on the street, which Andy picks up but doesn't have an
address where to return it to. When he plays her song, he falls in love
with her for sure.</P>
<P>To add to the romantic chase, two free-spirited carnies come to town for
the fair, Etienne
(George Chakiris-- he danced in West Side Story) and Bill (Grover Dale).
They are looking for a quickie romance, bragging about their exploits
with other girls, as they hang around Yvonne's stand. Their motto is
delivered by song: "They call us carnies, but poets are what we are." In
an emergency situation they pickup Boubou as a favor for Yvonne and meet
the twins, falling madly in love with them. But the girls do not trust
them. When the dancers performing in their show, run away with two
sailors, they make a deal with the girls, that if they perform in the
show, they will give them a ride to Paris.</P>
<P>All the lovers' stories intertwine, there is even a slasher story thrown
into the mix, as the town is fearful that there is a madman on the
loose. Demy is in the habit of referring to his other films, keeping his
films alive as an ongoing saga, here the victim is Lola, who was the
heroine in one of his first films- "Lola" (61). Her gruesome murder is
made into a jolly song, continuing with the upbeat mood of this surreal
film. Everything seems to work, no matter how awkward, there was just so
much energy and good chemistry, that mistakes were made unimportant. I
simply loved it for its vitality, realizing that if I saw it in the
1960s, I might not have been so taken with its lack of political
perception. Though, there was an attempt to show how the ordinary
citizens of the town are filled with spontaneous song, breaking into
dance whenever the mood strikes them, as opposed to all the soldiers in
town forced to march, thereby leading repressed lives.</P>
<P>It was a film that had bad timing for its release date, it was the wrong
time to pay homage to Hollywood musical films, such films were already
passe and revolution was in the air and in the arts, and this film was
just an anamoly. But like Demy says, love is a matter of chance
meetings, and years later, as this film is released on video for the
first time, after Demy's wife, Agnes Varda, led the efforts for
restoration, audiences have a chance to catch up with a great film that
has been passed up through no fault of its own.</P>
