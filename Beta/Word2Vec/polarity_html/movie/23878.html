<PRE>Rating: Good Shot (3 out of 4 stars)</PRE>
<P>Languid, yet pointed and focused, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai
sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek,
ultra-cool, cinematic image of the hitman. Juxtaposing the samurai's
honor code of feudal Japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of
the american/italian mafia, it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor's
precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber,
dinosaur-like, to function in the modern era. Director Jarmusch
gleefully plays the iconoclast, ripping into Mafioso precepts with
splashes of acidic wit. Using a palate of bleached colors, Jarmusch
lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks
of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film. He doesn't cater to
audience expectations of hyper-colorized, stylized violence and gunplay
where no one dies. The action is presented in flat, brutal codas.
Bullets have permanence. Death has consequences. The movie rises beyond
standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and
loyalty. It is an anti-movie, of sorts. There are few photogenic,
empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with. This isn't
a film that lovingly holds your hand. There are dark, contemplative
moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder, just so,
asserting itself for all to see.</P>
<P>The fulcrum for the movie's thematic balancing act is Ghost Dog, a mafia
hitman. A twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer, Ghost
Dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms. Unlike the sleek, muscular
killing machines one is accustomed to, we are given an inner city black
man who is overweight and slovenly, replete with chapped, dirty hands
and rumpled clothing. He wears a hooded sweatshirt, which he often pulls
over his head, giving him a monk-like appearance. There are no acrobatic
back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal. He uses old, worn
weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical, efficient and
pleasureless fashion. Ghost Dog is a disciple of the old ways of the
samurai, distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a
book, which he reads daily, Hagakure: The Way of the Samurai. Life
consists of simple pleasures for him: ice cream, warm rooftop naps and
good books. Ghost Dog lives, as it were, by the basic tenet expressed by
his book; one should start each day considering oneself as dead. Living
atop an abandoned building, surrounded by his flock of pet carrier
pigeons, Ghost Dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and
friends. He craves nothing more. As he puts it late in the film, "I've
seen all I want to see." He exists in a spiritual world of the mind,
gaining moral sustenance from his readings.</P>
<P>Ghost Dog wasn't always as he is presented. In several Roshomon-like
flashbacks, it's shown how Ghost Dog was assaulted by racist white males
and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a Good
Samaritan, that "Samaritan" being a foot soldier in an aging crime
family. Ghost Dog pledges his life to the service of the man, Louie
(Tormey), as repayment. After years of loyal service, Ghost Dog is sent,
by Louie, to kill "Handsome Frank", a made man within Louie's
organization who has run away with the crime boss's daughter, Louise
(Vessey). Ghost Dog wordlessly executes his task, witnessed by Louise,
whom he spares, as she sits watching a Betty Boop cartoon, clutching a
copy of the book, Roshomon. In a bit of synchronicity, Louise loans the
book to Ghost Dog.</P>
<P>Upset that Frank was taken out by someone not from the family, the mob
bosses, in turn, put out a hit on Ghost Dog in a perverse twist of
loyalty to their assassinated comrade. The rest of movie holds the dated
value systems of both the mafia and Ghost Dog up to the light of a new
millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into
conflict.</P>
<P>The theme of old cartoons flares up time and again, each time showing
cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of Ghost
Dog's world. Each time a character is shown watching a cartoon, it's
from the same era, Betty Boop, Felix the Cat, etc., a reflection of days
gone by. Near the end, Louise is watching a cartoon that's a departure
from the previously shown ones. It's a bit of audacity on Jarmusch's
part that is nicely effective, despite it's surrealistic nature.</P>
<P>As Ghost Dog floats through his world, his life is touched by two
people. One is a sage little girl (Winbush) who connects with Ghost Dog
through their love of reading. She comes to symbolize a melding of the
old ways and  new sensibilities, just as Louise ultimately does. By
film's end, the fact that Jamusch is so effective at illustrating the
tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer.
The other person in Ghost Dog's world is an ice cream (de Bankole')
vendor who only speaks french, yet intuitively shares a rapport with
Ghost Dog. The vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land.</P>
<P>Jarmusch, through rapper/composer RZA,  underscores his film with rap
and reggae music, which at first blush seems dichotomous, but its primal
rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie. Ghost
Dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to
as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars. (Which, in and of
itself, presents another paradox about Ghost's Dog's sense of honor.)</P>
<P>The head Mafioso is played by Henry Silva with a stone faced
resignation. Of all the cartoonish mobsters, he is the only one who
appears self aware of his state in the world. Gorman plays Sonny, a
lieutenant who respects the old ways, yet has a quirky affinity for rap
music, a love comically shown in several impromptu displays. Ruffini
seems the truest reflection of the mafia. He is a husk of a man,
assisted by two hearing aids, who barks out advice without truly hearing
what he, or others are saying.</P>
<P>Whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor's use, his
face. Ghost Dog is reticent to speak, often going for long periods
without doing so. The fact that Whitaker can convey such a wide range of
emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent. Although the
film has a deliberate pace, some of the  late night drives and walks
taken by Ghost Dog dragged the momentum down.</P>
<P>Truly tragic is how Ghost Dog misinterprets Japanese honor in his final
confrontation with the mob. He reveals himself to be so desperate for
spiritual guidance through the Hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it
to what is real and true in his world. Carried on the shoulders of a
remarkable performance by Whitaker, Ghost Dog rises beyond being a
characterization or icon, into a figure that garners sympathy, if not a
bit of pity.</P>
