                     The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996)
                   A film review by Michael Dequina
                    Copyright 1996 Michael Dequina</PRE>
<P>The Long Kiss Goodnight (R) *** (out of ****)
        Meryl Streep tried it and failed.  Even Pamela Anderson Lee made an
attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets.  However, Geena Davis could
very well become the first bankable American female action star with The
Long Kiss Goodnight, a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller
directed by her husband, Renny Harlin.
        Davis plays Samantha Caine, a mousy suburban school teacher and
mother whose memories only go back eight years.  With the help of ethically
questionable private detective Mitch Hennessey (Samuel L. Jackson), she
slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as Charly Baltimore, tough-as-nails
CIA operative.  Needless to say, with the reappearance of Samantha/Charly
comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than
her memory.
        Shane Black netted a cool $4 mil for his script; I'm not so sure if
his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag, but for what it's
worth, it delivers the goods.  Like Black's previous work, such as Lethal
Weapon and The Last Boy Scout, the script juggles some impressive action
scenes with funny, quirky dialogue.  The humor especially works well in this
case, for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things
from taking things too seriously.  But there's no argument that the more
unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell: who can resist
the sight of Davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the
nearby treehouse or chasing after a car... while ice skating?
        Jackson and Davis make a good team.  Jackson is funny as ever as
ever; in fact, his spirited line deliveries, especially when he first
appears, are more than reminiscent of his work as Jules in Pulp Fiction.  As
good as he is, the one who should benefit the most from this project is
Davis, who shows much promise as an action heroine.  What makes her so
effective and why she should succeed where Streep and Lee failed is that she
doesn't take herself too seriously.  She is obviously in on the joke, slyly
taking jabs at herself and at the situation.  This is not to say that she
doesn't need work--sometimes she lays on the "toughness" a bit too thick and
comes off too much as a caricature.  But should the public embrace the film
and, in turn, the notion of a kick-ass female, Davis could have found her
special niche.
        It seems as if Davis and Harlin's first collaboration, the middling
pirate epic Cutthroat Island, was just a dress rehearsal (albeit a very
costly one) for Long Kiss, in which the wife-husband team hit their action
stride.  Anyone simply looking for a fun, escapist entertainment that
requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome
Kiss.</P>
