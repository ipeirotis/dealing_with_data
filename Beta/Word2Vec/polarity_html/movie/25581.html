<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A gross-out teenage spoof about their need for sex to give them respect,
as four upper-middle-class suburban high school male seniors make a pact
to lose their virginity by the end of the senior prom. The film has no
point to make but to emphasize that silly challenge, but, it at least
softens its obnoxious attitude with an ending that is more satisfactory
than what I expected from this shallow film. I can't see anyone but
teenagers and, perhaps, hapless parents of teenagers, finding anything
here of interest. Though some adults might look back to those halcyon
school days with an anxious leer and wish to recapture some pubescent
memories of some shameful incident and to feel the nostalgia again
through this movie. Looking through the eyes of a lost adolescence is
perhaps the only way to view this movie, a movie that makes sex into
something that is implicitly evil.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, as awful as this gross-out film is, it will become a movie
and video hit with its targeted youthful audience, following the
footsteps of that other cheap thrill movie, "There's Something About
Mary,"and because sex sells, other films like this one will
unfortunately follow.</P>
<P>The sexual awkwardness of the boys is exaggerated for comedic purposes,
and the school looks as if it is around only as a stage for the
teenager's rite-of-passage. Everything in the film is used to get a
laugh, but the film wasn't really funny, though its commercial success
is due to the guilty laughs it evokes. For me, it was just a childishly
gross and a sexually raunchy movie. But it smartly restrained itself and
never pushed the envelope that step too far, staying well within the
framework of how traditional sitcom comedy works.</P>
<P>The film's four grossest scenes are: 1) Beer with scum in it is
swallowed by an unsuspecting victim. 2) A girl unknowingly undresses in
front of a videocam, while the entire school watches on the Internet, as
an email is mistakeningly forwarded to all the high school students
telling of the site. 3) One of the boys masturbates on his mother's warm
baked apple pie. 4) A boy is given a strong dose of laxatives and runs
into the girls' bathroom and can't control the embarrassing sounds the
girls hear. There were other gross-out scenes in a movie that had no
edge, just embarrassing moments and vulgar gestures. If it weren't for
all the grossness about sex and toilets, this would be a typical
family-fare TV sitcom. There is nothing political about these seniors,
and the only thing that humanizes their obnoxious antics, are the girls.
They are around to tell these immature boys what a girl wants in a
relationship.</P>
<P>The film sells itself through its sex scenes and then after exploiting
every awkward sexual moment it possibly can from the teens, it reverses
itself with a contrived moral ending to say that love is not forced and
comes naturally, while those only interested in sex are creating
unnecessary problems for themselves and putting undue pressure on
themselves to be happy.</P>
<P>"Pie" makes four slices, showing how the four high school failures
graduate in sex, as they are seen together and individually as they make
their moves. Jason Biggs is Jim, a good student, an affable and
sympathetic figure, who gets tongue-tied when trying to talk to a girl
he is attracted to. He is experimenting with different ways to
masturbate, but he seems to get interrupted by his father (Levy) when he
is in the middle of stroking the salami. His understanding father uses
these opportunities to drily lecture him about the birds and the bees.
His moment of truth will come when the geek (Hannigan) he takes to the
prom, turns out to be sex freak. Thomas Ian Nicholas is Kevin. He has
gotten to third base with his steady girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) and
spends the entire picture trying to score with her. His big deal, is
that he can't say the four-lettered word love -- like, I love you Vicky.
Chris Klein is Oz. He's a handsome but not-too-bright star lacrosse
player, who strikes out with the girls because he acts like a jerk. He
realizes that he is not getting anywhere with that macho jock attitude,
so he switches directions and decides to join the chorus and become more
sensitive. He meets Heather (Mena Suvari), and she is supposed to be a
goody two-shoes, as they try to see if their relationship can be the
real thing. Eddie Kaye Thomas is the intellectually gifted Finch. He
gives Vicky's friend, the sexually mature and wisecracking Jessica
(Natasha) $200 to spread the word that he's a great lay and
well-endowed. Natasha overshadows the teens in this film, as she appears
like Mae West, much too advanced for this crew. She says that she lost
her virginity when she believed the guy who said he loved her.</P>
<P>The side players add to the gross-out gags. Seann W. Scott is Stifler.
He is a particularly rich and obnoxious jock. He throws the parties all
the in-teens attend, and he constantly gloats about how great he is.
Chris Owen is Sherman. He is a creepy character who gloats of a sexual
conquest which turns out to be a lie. For what goes for comedy, he
pisses in his pants when he gets caught in his lie. Shannon Elizabeth is
Nadia. She is a sexually appealing exchange student from Eastern Europe,
who is the victim in the videocam. Jennifer Coolidge is Stifler's
mother, who will do a Mrs. Robinson for Finch's post-prom graduation in
sex. A totally unnecessary scene, that was played without emotion or
reason.</P>
<P>The film's saving grace is the sound advice given about romance by the
females. Everything else about the film was just as gross as it appeared
to be. The unimaginative comedy is of the lowest level, meant to
titillate those in need of a teenage sexual massage.</P>
