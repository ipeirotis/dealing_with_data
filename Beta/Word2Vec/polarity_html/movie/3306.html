<PRE>                                   JUST CAUSE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Sean Connery, Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood,
           Kate Capshaw, Ed Harris.
Screenplay:  Jeb Stuart & Peter Stone.
Director:  Arne Glimcher.</P>
<P>     You could probably count on one hand the number of male stars
over 60 who can still carry a film:  Paul Newman, certainly; Clint
Eastwood; and of course, Sean Connery.  And what is astonishing
about all three of these examples is that for the longest time, few
people really thought of any of them as good actors.  They were
pretty boys, action heroes destined for obscurity once the youthful
good looks faded, but all three have developed unexpected range over
the years.  Sean Connery might have had the farthest to go, moving
from James Bond to Academy Award winner to veteran star.  He is an
impressive presence in JUST CAUSE, but he is wasted.  JUST CAUSE is
a sorry excuse for a thriller, with both narrative and character
handled with remarkable ineptitude.</P>
<P>     Connery plays Paul Armstrong, a Harvard law professor renowned
for his opposition to capital punishment.  He is approached at a
debate one night by a woman (Ruby Dee) who needs his help.  Her
grandson, Bobby Earl Ferguson (Blair Underwood), is on death row in
Florida, the result of what he claims was a forced confession.
Armstrong is reluctant to take the case at first, but at the
insistence of his wife Laurie (Kate Capshaw), he heads down to
Florida to investigate.  There he finds a very antagonistic local
police force led by detective Tanny Brown (Laurence Fishburne), some
questionable evidence, and a possible alternative suspect in the
person of convicted serial killer Blair Sullivan (Ed Harris).</P>
<P>     The cast of JUST CAUSE is loaded with talent, and that alone
offered a great deal of promise.  However, with the exception of
Laurence Fishburne, who is impressive as the hard-case small town
cop, they are given almost nothing to work with or fumble what they
do have.  The usually reliable Ed Harris bugs his eyes and bares his
teeth as the religious fanatic/psycho Sullivan, looking for all the
world like he is auditioning for the next Hannibal Lecter in case
Anthony Hopkins asks for too much money.  He does everything but say
"fava beans."  Kate Capshaw takes a step up from her
blink-and-you'll-miss-it role in LOVE AFFAIR, but she isn't really
subtle enough an actor to make the stock threatened wife role
anything interesting.  Blair Underwood has a few nice moments early,
but he too is saddled with a shallow character with some really
unpleasant undertones.</P>
<P>     Then there is Connery, who can do wonders with a wry smile but
is trapped in a character that looks like it was abandoned by
writers Jeb Stuart and Peter Stone two-thirds of the way through and
completed by computer.  There is some suggestion early in the film
that there is a reason Armstrong hasn't practiced law in 25 years, a
reason which will play a role in Ferguson's case.  Later, when
Armstrong is talking to Sullivan, Sullivan says that he sees in
Armstrong's eyes that he is a killer.  Again there is the suggestion
that there is a dark, guilty secret in Armstrong's past, but there
is never another mention of the issue.  Connery is left stranded
without any real motivation, and as the plot develops that absence
proves crucial, leaving his feelings about criminal justice
completely unexplored.</P>
<P>     Actually, describing the plot as "developing" is something of
an overstatement.  JUST CAUSE is a completely predictable thriller,
with deus ex machina clues popping up for Armstrong to discover and
a plot twist which was nearly inevitable.  Director Arne Glimcher
doesn't appear to have a single original idea for how to construct a
film like this, so he puts together ideas from a hundred other
mundane thrillers:  a car chase here, a woman in distress there, a
serial killer, a mano-a-mano in the Everglades and some moody
lighting.  But there's just no point to any of it.  JUST CAUSE fails
to generate an ounce of tension because tension depends on
unpredictability and characters we genuinely want to see survive the
danger.  I was actually kind of hoping that everyone would end up as
gator bait.  The biggest mystery in JUST CAUSE ends up being why in
the world Sean Connery decided to do it.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 death sentences:  3.</PRE>
