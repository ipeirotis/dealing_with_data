<PRE>FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS
Rating: ***1/2 (out of four)
R, 1998
Directed by Terry Gilliam. Written by Gilliam, Tony Grisoni, Tod Davies, and
Alex Cox.
Starring Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro.</PRE>
<P>The promotion for FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS has made the film out to be a
comedy, and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one. It's
1971, and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs, among
them journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his "attorney" Dr. Gonzo (Benito
Del Toro). These two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor, having
strange hallucinations, trashing their hotel rooms, and either annoying or
scaring almost everyone that crosses their path. Duke is first assigned to
cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in Las Vegas, but gets lost in a blur
of drugs, beer, and flying dust, and ends up wandering around with no clue who
won. He leaves Vegas briefly before he is sent back, in what can only be
described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate, to cover a drug
enforcement conference.</P>
<P>FEAR AND LOATHING has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of
drugs. It doesn't, even in the beginning--while the pair's antics are
sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first, the humor here is still
fairly dark. Director Terry Gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye,
and even when we're laughing, we're laughing at them rather than with them.
They spend most of their time paranoid, angry, or just plain befuddled, which
is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill
up with giant reptiles. The black comedy may be entertaining to watch
onscreen, but it's probably not something most other audience members would
want to experience first-hand.</P>
<P>All this aside, I was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near
its one-hour mark, thinking to myself that I wanted something more out of this
than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture. Thankfully, the script
delivers it before too long, as Duke, in a rare moment of lucidity, stops to
recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie, "riding the wave" of something
that seemed special and important. Now it's six years later and the wave has
finally broken, as he puts it. Materialistic culture is still alive and well
and, for most of this film, right in his face in Las Vegas; the "American
Dream" of which Duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as
ever. The social protesters have lost, and the more questionable aspects of
the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as Duke to drift in a
sea of drugs and disillusionment.</P>
<P>In many ways, FEAR AND LOATHING is Gilliam's most reality-based film; all of
his others, with the exception of THE FISHER KING, have made use of some sort
of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements. Yet it is his off-the-wall
masterpiece BRAZIL to which this film bears the most visual resemblance. The
protagonist of BRAZIL found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic,
soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and
terrorist attacks, and similarly Duke's world is composed of the artificial,
empty glam of Las Vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations.
Unlike the protagonist of BRAZIL, however, Duke is not a particularly
admirable figure, and neither is Gonzo. During the latter half of the film,
their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse, eventually building up to
an incident an a diner in which Gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a
waitress, while Duke, though he doesn't seem to approve, doesn't do anything
to stop it either. By the time this scene takes place, they don't seem like
hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more; they just
seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner. Duke seems to realize at some
level that he's become something he doesn't like, but he's either too
apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change.</P>
<P>This film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an
essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at
the audience. While Gilliam may have overdone it in a few places, I think he
and his co-writers deserve more credit than that. There's plenty of substance
here, particularly in the second half; its observations about the broken and
defeated rebels from the '60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren't
usually very pleasant. Unlike, say, BRAZIL or THE FISHER KING, both of which
feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive
environment, FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS shows us someone who's given up on
his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs. In its own psychedelic,
whacked-out way, it's sad and regretful, but I think it's also a bit of a kick
in the pants, a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced
withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of Vegas-style materialism. Indeed,
Duke himself admits at one point that he's never learned to accept that you
can get higher without drugs than with them. I'm not sure if he's any closer
to accepting it by the end or not, but I suspect the audience will get the
idea.</P>
