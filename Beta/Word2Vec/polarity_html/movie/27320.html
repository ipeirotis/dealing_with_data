<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A mystery thriller from the pen of Daphne Du Maurier, tepidly adapted to
the screen from Gore Vidal's murky script in a workman-like way by
Robert Hamer. It's a one-idea film and that idea is unable to dispel all
the holes in the blurry plot, even though it is well-acted. It involves
a case of mistaken identity where a despondent, middle-aged, unmarried,
provincial British professor while taking a holiday in France, is
mistaken for Count Jacques De Gue. Alec Guinness has the double-role
playing Professor John Barratt and his lookalike, the Count. It is a
dual role he plays admirably, but he does not leave any lasting
impression in either part.</P>
<P>The lookalikes meet in a pub and drink together all night to celebrate
the coincidence of looking like each other. Sharing their life stories,
Barratt tells of how he has no one to love and no one who cares about
him, as he complains that he has too little of a life. The Count, on the
other hand, says his life is too rich, that he has a chateau, a title,
an income dating from the 19th century for his title, a wife and a
mistress, and severe business problems. Afterwards they go to his hotel
room in town and order through room service a bottle of champagne, as he
spikes Barratt's drink and switches clothes with him, leaving him to
wake up alone next morning as the chauffeur Gaston (Keen) arrives to
take him to his estate. When Barratt tries to explain who he is,
vociferously disclaiming that he is the Count and that he wants to go to
the police. Instead, Gaston calls the Count's physician (Howlett), who
informs him the family received a telegram that he's delusional after
being in Paris for two weeks -- and that he now thinks that he is
someone else, and that he should humor him and bring him back to the
estate, where he will give him a physical examination.</P>
<P>At the estate he meets the wife the real Count despises, Francoise
(Worth), and his precocious young daughter Marie Noel (Bartlett). In a
cameo role, his morphine-addicted acerbic mother (Bette Davis) plays
this one to chew all the scenery she could -- where she is either seen
as a bitter old lady who is bed-ridden and wants to possess her evil
son, or is dressed in black and speaking with a sulphurous tongue at the
police inquiry. He also meets at the dinner table his embittered sister
Blanche (Brown) who wears a cross around her neck and his embezzling
brother-in-law Aristide (Bull), who runs the glass foundry the Count
hasn't been to in 14 years and is now in danger of closing after being
the family business for 150 years, and is the reason he went to Paris to
get a new lease of life for the shaky business.</P>
<P>The only happiness the Count seems to have is in hunting game and being
with his Italian mistress Bela (Nicole), who is a noted horsewoman. He
meets her every Wednesday afternoon in her apartment after he drops his
daughter off for her music lessons.</P>
<P>Barratt, after an initial reluctance to do the deception, finds he
relishes looking after people and living a family life, and warms to the
idea of being the Count. He wants to help them all, but he wonders why
the Count pulled the switch -- Is it to let him solve his problems, or
to let the Count be someplace else?</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoilers to follow.</PRE>
<P>Francoise is killed on the day Gaston drives him to his mistress, as she
falls out the window. But after a police inquiry it is called an
accident.</P>
<P>He discovers something in the will about the Count inheriting a huge sum
of money if his wife dies without giving birth to a son, and he recalls
his wife's fear that he will kill her. Her death brings the real Count
back to town, and allows for the slight twist to the story that occurs
in the final scene. The surprise ending was predictable and did not help
salvage this rather dry film.</P>
<P>The film's main fault was that it failed to maintain a level of tension
for its mystery story, and the three weeks that Barratt played at being
a French nobleman was hardly believable. This is a good story as written
for a book, but it was not filmed with any verve. The middle part of it
seemed to be going nowhere and by the time the payoff came, the
confrontation between the morally concerned Barratt and the villainous
Count, seemed too artificial and lifeless for me to give its supposedly
shocking outcome a second thought.</P>
