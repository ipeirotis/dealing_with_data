<P>     Inevitably, someone is going to ask me why I subjected myself to 
this experience, and the only excuse I can think of is that I'm trying 
to populate my "Bottom 10 of 1997" list.  In any given year, the 
January-April period is traditionally a time when all sorts of bad 
movies are released.  So far, 1997 has been a bonanza in that 
department.  In just over four weeks, I've seen enough cinematic rubbish 
to overflow my mental recycling bin.  And now, having sat through THE 
PEST, I may have already found my worst movie of the year.</P>
<P>     THE PEST is apparently John Leguizamo's attempt to repeat Jim 
Carrey's sudden, inexplicable leap to fame with ACE VENTURA.  Judging by 
the first weekend's abysmal box office total, his jump fell considerably 
short -- right into the inky pit of oblivion, in fact.  By the time you 
read this review, it may be difficult to locate the movie in a theater -
- not that you'd want to.  The only reason this film might last beyond 
seven days is if there's a contractual obligation to be met.  </P>
<P>     It's mind-boggling to consider that movies this bad are actually 
committed to film.  The poor quality of THE PEST in almost every 
category -- humor, intelligence, creativity, and just plain 
entertainment value -- ranks it somewhere between a bad infomercial and 
a local cable newscast.  Rarely do I consider the act of seeing a movie 
to be a chore, but this kind of experience is the exception.  At least I 
have the consolation of recognizing that watching something like this 
will enable me to appreciate even a mediocre motion picture.  (Halfway 
through THE PEST, the idea of sneaking next door to watch the last half-
hour of DANTE'S PEAK was immensely appealing.)</P>
<P>     The plot -- if it can be called that -- introduces us to Pestario 
Vargas, a.k.a. "Pest" (Leguizamo).  When the Scottish mob, run by the 
gruff Angus (Charles Hallahan), calls in a $50,000 debt, Pest is hard-
pressed to come up with the cash.  As luck would have it, a German big-
game hunter (Jeffrey Jones) is looking for a Latino head to add to his 
human trophy collection, and he offers Pest a deal -- survive being 
stalked for 24 hours and earn enough to pay off Angus.  So, in one busy 
day, Pest meets his girlfriend's parents, attends a pool party, and 
imitates Scotty from STAR TREK -- all while being chased and shot at. </P>
<P>     The central attraction of THE PEST is Leguizamo (last seen in Baz 
Luhrmann's ROMEO AND JULIET), but, despite a seemingly endless supply of 
energy, he manages to strut his way through the entire movie without 
generating one good laugh.  He tries repeatedly, shamelessly pilfering 
gags from sources as diverse as Peter Sellers and the Three Stooges, yet 
somehow he manages to strip each of its humor.  When Inspector Clouseau 
leaned on a globe, it was hilarious; when Pest does it, it's not even 
worth a snicker.  For Leguizamo, this is embarrassing.  His "man of a 
thousand faces" routine (accompanied by an equal number of unfunny 
accents) is so irritating that it can engender an immediate and 
passionate dislike for the character. We're supposed to be astonished by 
the quickness and ease with which he sheds one personality and takes on 
another, but this uninspired grandstanding is a pale shadow of what more 
gifted comics (like Steve Martin and Robin Williams) are capable of.  
Someone should inform the actor that goofy costumes and manic energy do 
not automatically equate to humor.  After sitting through THE PEST, I'm 
beginning to gain an appreciation for Jim Carrey.</P>
<P>     This really isn't a coherent movie -- it's a bunch of juvenile 
skits strung together for a painfully long eighty-five minutes.  There's 
no film making skill evident in the job accomplished by director Paul 
Miller.  His method of operation seems to have been to let Leguizamo mug 
it up constantly and hope for the best.  What he got was an unmitigated 
disaster.  In truth, this film has to be seen to be believed.  It's the 
kind of movie where every paying customer deserves to receive a 
handwritten apology from the producers.  </P>
<P>     So, without further ado, let THE PEST take its rightful place in 
the motion picture Hall of Shame, right alongside such unforgettable 
recent classics as THE MANGLER and ADRENALIN.  </P>
