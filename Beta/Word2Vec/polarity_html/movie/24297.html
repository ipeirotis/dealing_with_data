<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A serious but stiffly told story of how miracles are proven by the Roman
Catholic Church and how the church goes about choosing a saint. The
film's leaden pace and pancake look and wooden acting, are all major
detractions. The only possible exception in the thespian department,
comes from the unfettered performance by Ed Harris as Father Frank
Shore, the one questioning his faith while acting as the postulator-a
priest appointed by the church authorities to investigate if a sainthood
is warranted. At least, he was lively and looked as if he was into the
part.</P>
<P>This detective-like story revolves around the church's investigation of
the would-be saint, an ordinary, illiterate, laywoman, Helen O'Regan
(Barbara Sukowa), who immigrated to Chicago from Austria after WW 11.
During the investigation some mysterious circumstances about her early
childhood crops up, even disputing where she was born. She lived in the
church's rectory and ran a soup kitchen there, giving of herself to the
poor Polish-American community, which looks like a replica of bombed-out
Germany after WW11.</P>
<P>I'm not a believer in miracles, nor am I disbeliever in miracles. I just
don't think an orthodox religion, one that demands blind faith and
obedience from its members can find the truth about such spiritual
matters (that's why I'm a non-believer in orthodox religions). For me, a
miracle is when someone overcomes their karma and finds enlightenment,
and is able to be filled with love, living without illusions, who can
convey this feeling to others and make the world a little better place
to live in. The only proof needed for such a miracle is in the freedom
felt from within, by the person experiencing it. But for those who are
believers in the orthodox, needing some proof that God can hear their
prays, then this serious-minded film with its lack of kitsch,
supposedly, can shed some light how a saint is chosen and how miracles
are documented by the church. But, unfortunately, the story is not able
to overcome the handicaps of its plodding story and therefore it fails
to materialize as a credible one.</P>
<P>The 52-year-old, Polish-born director, Agnieszka Holland, raised in a
Communist country, whose father was Jewish and mother was a Catholic, is
supposedly a practicing Catholic, which might explain why her adopted
religion is treated with kid gloves and only marginally criticized. In
my opinion, the process of choosing a saint is just as much political as
religious, and the director waffled in which direction to go. In the
end, she chose to cop-out, with one of those slick, unsatisfactory
modern endings, which is contrary to the underpinnings of this very
European-styled film. It results in a draw between the rivals within the
church structure, and who feels satisified walking away from an event
and not having a winner!</P>
<P>In Chicago, circa 1979, a priest (Rispoli) who is a friend and colleague
of Father Frank, finds him living in an inner-city shelter, collecting
himself from the growing doubts he has about being a priest. He is being
called back to service by Bishop Cahill (Haid), whom he has worked for
in the past, having developed the reputation because of his cynicism of
being "the miracle killer," after finding proof to deny sainthood in
another case.</P>
<P>He confesses to a friend, that he became a priest not because he was
chosen, but because his policeman father was shot while he was a
teen-ager and he prayed to God that if his father lives he will become a
priest and dedicate his life to God. His father lived- but three months
later after he entered the seminary- his father died.</P>
<P>The politically-motivated bishop assigns him the role of postulator in
the O'Regan case, after being pressured by local officials that a statue
that Helen prayed to, of the Virgin Mother, is tearing blood. Blood
samples taken from the statue will test positive for the same blood-type
Helen had. This only happens in November, the month the would-be saint
died, and the working-class believers gather there to receive her
blessings. There is no rational explanation for this occurrence.</P>
<P>Since there are three confirmed miracles needed as a prerequisite to
confirm a saint, the postulator prepares his report (positio) on her in
detail, trying to gather evidence of her miracles. This will be
submitted to the Church's upper echelons. If favorable, the church
officials may forward the case to Rome for final approval.</P>
<P>The priest gets someone to help him collect evidence, a true believer,
Brother Gregory (Gallanders). He then meets the putative saint's
daughter, Roxanna (Heche), who feels her mother abandoned her to the
church and withheld her love from her. She therefore refuses to help in
the investigation. The priest finds her attractive and in his search for
the truth, which becomes as much about finding himself than in getting
to the truth about his subject, he battles the church's belief that
miracles are real and can actually be proved by science if they are
authentic. He is also battling his inner feelings of doubt, and his
recurring bouts of lust are added to this battle scenario.</P>
<P>The priest discovers he has a carnal interest in Roxanna, which he is
able to resolve, but it is done in such a banal way, with no chemistry
between the two to justify their relationship, or does their
relationship result in finding anything significant to say about a
priest thinking like a man.</P>
<P>After that relationship, Father Frank's steadfast mission becomes to get
the sainthood for Helen, as if that will make him a believer again. He
is opposed by the disdainful Archbishop Werner (Armin Mueller-Stahl),
"the devil's advocate," who talks in a muffled German accent, as if he
were playing Brando's Godfather part and had wads of cotton stuck in his
mouth. The rivalry between these two sparked no particular interest,
seeming like old hat seen in countless films, a battle between a man of
the people and a snob favoring the elite, as their battle of wits seemed
witless, being fought in a room with a long table before them like they
were in a board room of a business corporation.</P>
<P>The filmed just died from exhaustion and couldn't be revived like the
girl who had lupus was. Maria Witkowski's (Scorsone) unexplained
recovery from that incurable disease, after being touched by Helen, is
the miracle that the church is now examining for authenticity, even if
she lived only to become a teenage junkie and prostitute. But she was
not so lucky, after a severe beating from a pimp, she was placed on life
support. But she was again miraculously revived when she was taken off
life support, as if it Helen was still with her. Is this too a miracle?</P>
<P>It was difficult to believe in the story or be absorbed in it, as the
acting was stilted and the
process of choosing a saint did not enlighten me as to what really
happens in the church back rooms. I found it impossible to believe
anything Father Frank found about Helen would, necessarily, make her a
saint, except for political reasons to satisfy the faithful. I don't
know what I learned from this film, or what the film tried to deliver as
a message. But I do know that the story failed to keep me from yawning,
as I preferred the much more flawed recent miracle film, Stigmata, to
this one, even though this film had no kitsch like the other one did,
but it also had very little movement and took few risks in the
sober-minded way its story was told. So much for the intelligent telling
of a story, if the story is not convincing. There would have to be a
fourth miracle to get me to believe in this flick.</P>
