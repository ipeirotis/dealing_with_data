<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"The Pledge," adapted from a novel by the Swiss writer Friedrich
Dürrenmattis, is the third and the finest of the three films Sean Penn
(The Crossing Guard/The Indian Runner) has directed. It's a grim tale
filled with nostalgia, tenderness, and grief. Jack Nicholson gives a
subdued and arguably his best performance ever as a sixtysomething,
retired Reno, Nevada, homicide detective, Jerry Black, who aims to go
fishing for his retirement but instead continues working a case started
on his last day on the job, of a grisly child rape-murder mutilation,
because he promised the victim's mother that he would get the killer. He
swears this on a cross the child victim made. The only reason he goes
out to the parents' turkey farm to tell them the tragic news, is because
no one else in the sheriff's department feels comfortable enough to do
it.</P>
<P>The film is set just outside Reno, in the beautiful mountain towns where
poverty and harsh living conditions loom for those who care to see
beyond what the tourist sees as idyllic conditions. The story revolves
around a police investigation to get the killer of the little 7-year-old
Ginny Larsen, but the investigation quickly closes when the snowmobiler
youngster who found the body tips the police off about an agitated
Indian (Benicio Del Toro) he spotted in the crime vicinity and the
Indian when brought in for questioning confesses and then kills himself.
The film then becomes more about the aging loner detective and about his
psychological composure, as he has a strong hunch that the Indian wasn't
the killer; but, his interest in the case is frowned upon by his fellow
officers who moments ago were praising him, at his retirement reception,
to the skies for his career work. His successor is Stan (Aaron Eckhart),
who is a brash young man and of a totally different generation; he's
aggressive in getting a confession, seducing the Indian to confess by
sidling up to him and cajoling him to tell him what he wants to hear.
Stan once thought Jerry was a great cop and looked up to him, but now
along with the police chief, Eric (Shepard), thinks Jerry has lost it
and is just a drunken clown who can't handle not working and being in on
the macho action.</P>
<P>Jerry is so obsessed with this murder that comes on his last day on the
job, that he decides to dedicate himself to catching the killer on his
own without help from his former colleagues. He begins by locating a
policeman in another district and finds that the little girl victims all
fit the same profile. He takes a drawing that Ginny made of a giant
giving her presents, that was hung in her school, as he believes this
drawing clearly shows the killer as a tall white male, driving a station
wagon, and is luring her by offering the girl presents. To reaffirm what
the drawing might mean he visits a psychologist (Mirren), who can only
speak of the drawing in hypothetical terms. But she spots that since his
retirement, he's going bonkers because something is weighing heavily on
his mind: as he hears voices, nervously chain-smokes, and is sweating a
lot because he's in an agitated state. He also visits a father (Rourke)
who's daughter has been missing for 3 years, and reconfirms his own
grief over the victim and that all the victims wore a red dress.</P>
<P>On a whim he buys a mountain gas station from Floyd (Stanton), and uses
that as his place to observe the comings and goings of any suspects. In
town he befriends a battered waitress, Lori (Robin Wright Penn, the
director's wife), who has an 8-year-old daughter named Chrissy. She also
has a restraining order against her husband and when he batters her
again, she moves in with the pensive and sensitive Jerry. The
arrangement blossoms as Jerry enjoys taking care of them and acting
fatherly to the little girl. But when Jerry's suspicions lead him to
believe that a smiling part-time minister and snow-plow driver, Gary
Jackson, is his man, he sets a trap for him using Chrissy as bait; this
obsession with the case leads to Jerry's downfall.</P>
<P>Penn is to be commended for his nuanced shooting of the film and his
confident way of telling the story through a retired detective who is
becoming mentally unbalanced, and in the ambiguous ending that makes the
viewer resolve the story as he thinks it should be. The last shot of
Nicholson mumbling to himself in the already gone to seed filling
station, is a striking reminder of how an artist can become so obsessed
by his work that he might lose sight of his own life. Penn has directed
a superb film, that is interestingly photographed and brings out fine
performances from this sterling cast. Many cast members gave cameo
performances that fit the grey mood of this very emotionally felt film.
It's one of the better murder mystery stories made, one that is more a
psychological study of the detective than of the killer. It is more
pertinent as a character study than as a murder investigation.</P>
