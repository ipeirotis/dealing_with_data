<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>James William Guercio was the producer of Chicago albums in the Seventies, and
this is his only directorial effort. It's a "message" film with "message songs"
playing in the background, as its ultimate message is that it is better to live
in peace and make the world a better place to live in then to blindly obey
authority figures. It's main aim is to delve into the character of a short
Arizona motorcycle cop, who is the same height as Alan ladd (five feet tall).
His name is John Wintergreen (Blake), who dreams of being a homicide detective
because they earn their pay by using their brains and it's a glory job. When he
briefly attains that dream, it soon sours and he's left looking inside himself
for answers. The film's other aim is to show the lost dreams and violence that
fills America's wastelands and wounds those living there. </P>
<P>The main rivals of the cops are the hippies, as a clash over culture and values
exists. The elderly are shown as a forsaken people, who are dying from
loneliness and from failed dreams. The film is quirky, atmospheric, interesting
in its character study, and is successful as a black comedy. Robert Blake as the
protagonist is perfect for the part. It's main flaw is that its messages are too
simplistic and the story suffers, at times, from a heavy-handed direction. </P>
<P>As the film opens, motorcycle cop Wintergreen proves to be a stud while in bed
with the local barmaid, the tall and buxom Jolene (Riley). On the job with his
corrupted partner, Zipper (Bush), they patrol the hot desert roads looking for
speeding cars. They soon come across a hippie in a VW wagon and Zipper goes on a
power trip to harass the hippie and plant drugs on him. Zipper prefers to remain
in the shade for most of his tour of duty, as Wintergreen prefers to play the
game of being the tactful motorcycle cop making the roads safe from speeders. </P>
<P>Wintergreen sees his big chance to show that he's of homicide detective
material, when the motorcycle cops come across a raving lunatic in the desert, a
harmless recluse named Willie (Cook). He tells them that his only friend Frank
is dead in his shack and that he had $5,000 hidden there. When Wintergreen
investigates he does it by the book the way he imagines a detective would, and
he finds a shotgun, shell fragments in a loaf of bread and pork chops on the
fire which he uses to determine the time the death occurred. He suspects murder
because the wound was in the chest and not the head. The coroner (Dano) says
it's suicide and wishes to save the county the expense of an unnecessary
autopsy. But when pompous homicide detective, Harve Poole (Ryan), arrives on the
scene, he suspects foul play and when the thorough investigation is completed
they find that there is another bullet in Frank. Upon further investigation of
his shack they find a supply of red speed pills and that the drug money is
missing. The fingerprints of a hippie drug dealer, Zemko (Cetera-a member of the
Chicago band), are all over the shack. </P>
<P>Now with a murder investigation on the way, Harve takes Wintergreen under his
wing to teach him how to be a detective. He also makes him his driver and
impresses the young cop by showing him how to go about conducting an
investigation, saying the most important thing isn't always the facts but what
hits you inside. Wintergreen soon gets disillusioned with Harve when he observes
his unethical methods of getting info on Zemko's whereabouts, as he beats the
info out of the commune members. The relationship breaks completely off when
Harve realizes that Wintergreen has learned about his women problems and can't
be trusted to be part of the old-boy cop network. Soon Wintergreen is back on
motorcycle patrol with his dishonest partner, Zipper. </P>
<P>The film has plenty of action scenes, culminating with a motorcycle chase; a
good twist in the murder mystery story; and, what it does best is show how
lonely people could be and how this is sometimes the driving force behind the
false lives they lead. Because of the excellent photography, via Conrad Hall, of
the Monument Valley desert region and the apt depictions of the barren inner
landscapes of the individual's trapped by their lies, this film comes through as
a powerful story of an individual who is done in by the corruption of society
and individuals. </P>
<P>It sets a thumping mood throughout, especially, with scenes of the band called
Madura playing a concert to a desert audience, while the Robert Blake character
was at that point in the story trying to find for himself what is important in
his life so he could live with dignity and not fall by the side of the road like
all the other disillusioned people he met. </P>
