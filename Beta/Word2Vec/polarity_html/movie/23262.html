ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER (TODO SOBRE MI MADRE) (director/writer: Pedro
Almodóvar; cinematographer: Affonso Beato; cast: Cecilia Roth (Manuela),
Marisa Paredes (Huma Rojo), Candel Pena (Nina), Antonia San Juan
(Agrado), Penelope Cruz (Sister Rosa), Rosa Maria Sarda (Rosa's mother),
Fernando Fernan Gomez (Rosa's father), Toni Canto (Lola), Eloy Azorin
(Esteban), 1999-Spain)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Cecilia Roth, the wonderful Argentinian-born actress, is the focal point
of the film and it is fair to say that her outstanding performance tries
to portray what the director wants to say about the nature of
motherhood. She plays Manuela, a 38-year-old nurse coordinator in a
transplant organ unit in a Madrid hospital. She is a single-parent with
a son Esteban (Eloy Azorín), who wants to be a writer and is about to
celebrate his 17th birthday. He is watching TV with her and the movie
"All About Eve" is on, which encourages him to write in his pad, "All
About My Mother."</P>
<P>The boy's favorite writer is Truman Capote. For his birthday present,
Manuela takes him to the theater to see Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar
Named Desire." The enthusiastic youngster, always with a notebook near
him, always ready to jot down things in his journal, such as his wish to
know who his father is, is star-struck by the masterly performance of
the aging actress playing Blanche Dubois, Huma (Marides). He waits for
her in the rain by the stage door with his mother after the show to get
her autograph, and when she gets in a cab he chases after her but gets
fatally hit by a car. This is filmed from his eye-sight view of the
accident, so what the audience sees is what he saw.</P>
<P>His mother is asked to donate his organs by the same doctors she works
with, the ones who just completed a dry-run of what it is like for
family members to be asked to be organ donors. In this film there is
little difference between what is real and what is fake. After she
agrees to donate his organs, she decides to fulfill her son's wish to
find the boy's father and she goes back to Barcelona, where she came
from 18 years ago. She has lost all contact with the father while in
Madrid and will try to retrace her steps.</P>
<P>But, before she goes on the journey, she must see who received her son's
heart and is relieved to see it is a decent fellow, as she watches him
leave the hospital and overhears him from her hiding place gleefully
talking about having a young man's heart him in.</P>
<P>This is the 13th Pedro Almodóvar film I have seen, one that many critics
say shows the aging, enfant terrible director maturing, becoming kinder
and gentler, showing a capacity for making a film with more of a
conventional plot and being less interested in shocking his audience as
he once loved to do. But the shock is still there, enough of it to keep
it from becoming a mainstream film. The shock comes from the characters
Manuela will meet on her journey back to where she hung around with
prostitutes and transvestites. To visually show her path back and forth
from Barcelona to Madrid, there is a stunningly photographed tunnel
looking very much like a womb, with a train racing through it.</P>
<P>Though the film has a pungency to it, there are just too many scenes
where the wit seems forced and doesn't flow in the natural rhythm of the
story. The film is filled with many references and homages to other
Hollywood films and to writers, something that is both good and bad. It
is good because too many films are devoid of any intellectual
influences. Bad because the references are overused here, making the
director's gushy homages too syrupy for my taste buds.</P>
<P>In Barcelona, Manuela meets again her friend Agrado (Antonia San Juan- a
popular nightclub performer, who plays this role in an amusingly
unrestrained manner). He is a transvestite prostitute, working in an
outdoor area known as the Field, where the customers are riding around
in a circle to look the odd assortment of male and female prostitutes
over, a very Fellini-like scene. Symbolically, it indicates that
Manuela's life is going around in circles, she is back to where she
started as a prostitute. Agrado was an actor with her in an amateur
production of the Tennessee Williams's play; he was a man then but has
since had breast implants and a complete make over to look like a woman.
He is upset because his transvestite lover, who used to be called
Esteban but now is Lola (Canto), has just run away from him. Lola also
happens to be another actor in that amateur play 18 years ago that
Agrado and Manuela were in and the father of Manuela's child. But he
doesn't know that.</P>
<P>This is a story about many different things: its subplots could take you
into areas such as organ donors, AIDS, coincidences, family
relationships, family values, and the affects of pop culture on the
public (take note of that hilarious diaper commercial, an actual one
shown on Spanish TV); but, the film's main premises were about: praising
actresses, praising motherhood, praising sexual ambiguity, and praising
the kindness from strangers (tolerance of all people seems to be the
strongest message emanating from the film).</P>
<P>The mixed feelings I got about the film come from my not being sure if
this film is meant to be taken as a parody or a tragic soap opera. My
perception of all the supporting characters was of them being
problematic: the two transvestites; a pregnant nun with AIDS who
counsels needy prostitutes; Huma, as an actress, who is in a hopeless
lesbian relationship with another actress, the junky Nina (Pena); and,
all the while, this is a story about women as actresses and as mothers
and as sexually ambiguous figures. There were times I didn't know
whether I was supposed to laugh at all this or cry.</P>
<P>This film is melodramatic in the tradition of the Douglas Sirk nuclear
family romantic Rock Hudson and Dorothy Malone ones of the 1950s, but
with Almodóvar, it becomes even a weepier one, one that is mostly
outrageous, one whose family nature is more ambiguous and certainly not
nuclear. It is a film that is paradoxical: men can be actresses also. It
is one that has a character who takes the name Agrado, which means
agreeable and an actress, Huma, who is influenced by Bette Davis in "All
About Eve," whose chosen name means chain-smoker. Bette influenced her
totally, including her smoking habit.</P>
<P>The deftness of the cinematography and the array of colors displayed are
simply dazzling. This film could be enjoyed solely for its bright
orange, red and yellow patterns, giving the eye a startling light show
to feast on, as the camera is constantly moving from one thing of beauty
to another. It is a film made by someone who has the self-confidence to
know who he is (a beautiful gay man) and to realize that his film will
be different things to different people: to those searching for their
own identity, it could be seen how resilient the characters are who are
adding body parts to change their sexual orientation. For the ones
adjusting to the loss of the dearest one in their life, like Manuela,
after having given away the deceased's body parts, it could be a way of
accepting change. The characters in this film will find ways to adjust
to their situation, these are not characters who will fall apart and
have nervous breakdowns. It is worth noting, that there is no criticism
by the director for any of his characters, no matter how they screw
things up.</P>
<P>What Almodóvar wishes to express, is his adoration for all women. He
dedicated the film to actresses who played actresses: Bette Davis, Gena
Rowlands, and Romy Schneider. The problem with all this adulation is
that all the flattery has a hollow ring to it, it is just too good to be
true, and his characters are not completely believable because of this.</P>
<P>The film's strength lies in the emotions of the characters; their
close-ups revealing an inner strength in them, that no matter what
they've been through, they will stick together and not succumb to their
overwhelming problems. Agrado, after being battered by a psychopath,
gets dressed in her imitation pink Chanel dress and takes Manuela to
meet the attractive Sister Rosa (Penélope Cruz) in the prostitutes'
shelter. In return Agrado is consoled by the empathetic Manuela. A
pregnant nun in an Almodóvar film shouldn't be that surprising to his
fans, in fact what else should they expect! The father of Sister Rosa's
child, by coincidence, is Lola, the same father of Manuela's child. The
anguished Sister Rosa will come to live in the apartment that Manuela
rents and be nursed by the woman who is both a tower of strength and a
fragile grieving mother.</P>
<P>When the older and younger women form a warm relationship, Manuela is
introduced to Rosa's so-called normal but not-knowing-how-to-love
parents. She first meets her wealthy mother (Sarda), who makes fake
Chagalls. This is another of the director's themes, of how the ones who
are supposed to be normal and try so hard to convey that impression, are
really fakes, while the ones who are considered to be oddballs in
society, could be the normal ones, who are at least living out their
fantasies. Later on, Manuela will meet Rosa's father (Gomez), who might
have Alzheimer's, or maybe he just doesn't seem to remember who his
daughter is. The family dog is the one who remembers her. The hurt look
on Rosa's face after her father leaves, gives us a picture of her
thought process that is better than dialogue, it is one that is worth
savoring.</P>
<P>There is one scene when Agrado announces that the performance of
"Streetcar..." will be cancelled but for those who want to stay, she
will tell her life story. Of course, this clears most of the audience
out, with those few remaining being mostly the young and more daring
ones, the same audience that has sustained the director over the years.
She proceeds to tell how he got put together into a she and how much
each part cost, in a comic bit that seemed, at least it did to me, that
the director was trying to please his audience too much.Trying to
convince everyone remaining that they could be who they want to be, all
they have to do is pay the price for their dreams.</P>
<P>The actors were all splendid. I was particularly impressed by Marisa
Paredes' subtle but invigorating performance. The aging actress had a
certain air about her that invigorated every scene she was in, showing
how vulnerable and engaging an actress she is. Cecilia Roth was the glue
that held the film together. But when the spotlight was on Marisa, what
the director was trying to say about actresses' had a clarity about it
that didn't seem forced.</P>
<P>But still, what makes an Almodóvar film special, is his eye for visual
effects. I haven't seen a more stunning visual film all year (it is
comparable to Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut"). I was so dazzled by the
visuals, that the film's metaphors, bizarre tale, and great actors, seem
to take second place to the visual splendor of the film.</P>
<P>As good as this film is, one of the problems Almodóvar still has, is
that he can't make his outrageous characters distinguishable from
caricatures. Making them seem normal by comparing them to the normal
parents of Cruz', or those normal theater patrons walking out of that
childish Agrado discourse when they paid good money to see a play and
not him lecture them about how he paid his dues to be the girl he is, is
not really making them seem normal. This cloy act of his does not make
Agrado any more compelling. What the director shows best is his
unyielding love to all these strange characters, the social outcasts,
those who are looked down by society. He treats them as if he was the
mother, the one who loves them for what they are, who loves them as only
a mother can love her own. His wish seems to be that society would also
give them a chance to be loved.</P>
<P>One must give Almodóvar credit for getting his voice heard in the
mainstream while keeping his artististic integrity intact. That is not
an easy thing to do and the director has used the popular vehicle of
Hollywood melodrama to add his own sense of culture and literary
references to it, despite the differences I have with his approach to
the characters and their development. The film's story line is ludicrous
but the hurt the characters receive as perceived by them is real.
Almodóvar retains in this work an intriguing call for the bizarre, that
keeps the film from descending toward being a Hollywood one. But it also
never reaches great artistic heights. There are no breakthroughs in
character study. This is basically still a message film. A most amusing
and diverting portrayal of the sexually ambiguous, but not a great film.</P>
<P>The critical success of this film makes for strange bedfellows, when the
'chic' Cannes crowd hooted in disappointment that the film wasn't chosen
as the best one in the festival, but cheered when Almodóvar won for best
director, they now might be considered as part of the usual Almodóvar
fan base of weirdoes and independent-minded movie goers, a fan base that
seems to be growing to accomodate a different type of enthusiast, one
that is more establishment orientated.</P>
