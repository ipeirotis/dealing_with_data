<PRE>                             LEGENDS OF THE FALL
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Brad Pitt, Aidan Quinn, Julia Ormond, Henry Thomas,
Anthony Hopkins.
Screenplay:  Susan Shilliday and Bill Wittliff.
Director:  Edward Zwick.</P>
<P>     LEGENDS OF THE FALL is a big, dumb bassett hound of a movie.
It stares at you with big sad eyes, slobbers all over you and
practically begs you to like it.  It's muddled, bombastic, and often
gets by purely on style points, yet for some reason, inexplicably,
it also manages to be occasionally entertaining.  I could spend days
listing all the things that are wrong with LEGENDS OF THE FALL, and
still I'd be left with the fact that something worked.  And perhaps
that something comes down to two words: Brad Pitt.  Radiating the
kind of charisma that screen actors just don't seem to have any
more, he single-handedly makes LEGENDS OF THE FALL watchable.</P>
<P>     Set in turn-of-the-century Montana, LEGENDS OF THE FALL is the
story of the Ludlow family, whose patriarch (Anthony Hopkins) is a
career soldier who moves the family when he retires in disgust over
the government's policy towards Indians.  The main action begins in
1914, when youngest son Samuel (Henry Thomas) brings his fiancee
Susannah (Julia Ormond) home to meet the family.  Her introduction
into the family proves extremely unsettling, as oldest son Alfred
(Aidan Quinn) falls for her, while she finds herself drawn to wild
middle son Tristan (Brad Pitt).  Soon all three brothers head off to
fight in the first World War, where a tragedy claims one of the
brothers, sending the other two into a life-long battle with
Susannah in the middle.</P>
<P>     For about half an hour, LEGENDS OF THE FALL is more than simply
passable; it's a grand, beautifully filmed family drama with
tremendous potential.  All the performances are perfectly tuned, the
interactions between the brothers are convincing and the story is
well-paced.  Then the brothers are off to Europe, and the story
veers off-track, and never fully recovers.  A film which had been
moving along at a confident and leisurely pace suddenly goes into a
dead sprint that seems to get faster and faster, until by the end I
felt quite relieved that it was over.  Along the way, we get detours
into a globe-spanning guilt-quest undertaken by Tristan, a scrap
with bootlegging Irish gangsters and not one, not two, but _three_
funerals.  When combined with the framing of the story as a kind of
Native American legend, complete with a mystical brotherhood between
Tristan and a bear, it almost becomes comic.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, the film's technical credits are spectacular.
Director Edward Zwick scored a successful screen melodrama with
GLORY, and he appears to use many of the same tricks in LEGENDS.  In
fact, the war scenes here might easily have been the same scenes
from GLORY with different uniforms added by computer.  But John
Toll's photography of the Canadian locations (substituting for
Montana) is wonderful, and one shot of Susannah reading a letter as
she walks among tall trees is a thing of beauty.  The score is by
James Horner, and as usual he lays the strings on thick as syrup,
but it works in LEGENDS.  As the narrative becomes more and more
stream of consciousness, the look and sound of LEGENDS OF THE FALL
actually seem to improve.</P>
<P>     For all that, the best thing that Zwick puts on the screen is
Pitt.  Freed from the suffocating gloom of Louis in INTERVIEW WITH
THE VAMPIRE, Pitt commands the screen from his first appearance.  He
is asked to slog through several melodramatic moments in LEGENDS OF
THE FALL, but his dark intensity keeps them from being as overblown
as they might have been, and he may be as convincing a crier as any
male actor in many years.  The problem is that for long stretches,
he disappears from the narrative entirely, while other members of
the Ludlow family and Susannah take center stage.  When that
happens, LEGENDS OF THE FALL comes perilously close to putting the
audience to sleep.  Then Zwick comes through with an exceptional
final fifteen minutes, including a retribution montage which might
strike some as a bit too reminiscent of the GODFATHER films yet
works in its own right.  LEGENDS OF THE FALL is by no stretch of the
imagination great filmmaking, and occasionally it's flat-out silly.
However, when you put an ascending star in an old-fashioned Western
epic, anything is possible.  And for LEGENDS OF THE FALL, it's just
enough.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 legends:  6.</PRE>
