<P>     It's difficult to explain the full range of emotional impact caused 
by EXOTICA.  The latest offering from Canadian film maker Atom Egoyan 
(FAMILY VIEWING, THE ADJUSTER) is as beguiling as it is baffling.  Not 
until the final scene does everything finally snap into focus, and when 
it does, the revelations have all the sudden, stark clarity of a vast 
nightscape illuminated by a flash of lightning.  Past scenes come rushing 
back with new meaning.  Whole perspectives change.  Egoyan has taken a 
seemingly-simple story and woven it into a near-masterpiece, creating 
images and an atmosphere that establish the perfect backdrop for a tale 
of loss, grief, and eroticism. </P>
<P>     The Exotica is a strip club in Toronto, where men go to watch, but 
not touch, a variety of unclothed women who strut their stuff to the 
pulsing sounds of a rich and varied soundtrack.  The most visible of the 
dancers is Christina (Mia Kirshner), a sultry brunette who comes on stage 
in a school girl costume and is introduced by the deejay Eric (Elias 
Kosteas) as a "sassy bit of jailbait."  Her gyrations as she unbuttons 
her white blouse give the illusion of corrupted innocence--a fantasy 
with its basis in reality. </P>
<P>     One of the club's regulars is Francis (Bruce Greenwood), a lonely 
government auditor who spends hours paying out money for Christina to 
dance privately for him.  The bond between these two is more profound 
than that of a normal dancer and client.  When Francis utters his refrain 
of "How could anyone hurt you?" to Christina, we're not aware of all the 
layers inherent in his words.  Only in retrospect do we ultimately 
understand. </P>
<P>     Paralleling Francis' story is that of Thomas (Don McKellar), a gay 
pet shop owner who runs a lucrative smuggling operation out of his place 
of more legitimate work.  Currently, his business is being investigated 
by Francis, and this forms the narrative link by which everything is 
eventually tied together.  Thomas is the shy, nerdy sort who doesn't know 
how to go about picking up men, until fate deals him a pair of opera 
tickets and a means by which to find a seemingly-limitless supply of 
partners.  But for Thomas, filling that aching void of the soul involves 
paying a hefty material price. </P>
<P>     On the surface, EXOTICA might seem to be about sex and lust.  
Nothing could be further from the truth.  Those elements are a slick 
sheen of polish over the real core.  While it's true that strip joints 
normally reek of excess, Egoyan's story seeks a more fundamental 
emotional level.  This film is driven by the grief and isolation of the 
characters.  The interpersonal connections made in EXOTICA are often 
obscure, and the reasons underlying otherwise-inexplicable actions are 
complex.   </P>
<P>     Everyone deals differently with loss, but Francis' problem is that 
he can't accept the tragedy which has defined his life.  The effects are 
too devastating, so he huddles behind a curtain of illusion spun by 
Christina, trying to reduce his crushing despair to something more 
bearable.  It's easy to mistake Francis for a dirty-minded middle-aged 
voyeur until you begin to understand what EXOTICA is saying.  And it's 
not until the final credits roll that the last word of that litany is 
spoken.  Very little about this picture is either predictable or 
conventional. </P>
<P>     As far as the major actors are concerned, there isn't a weak 
performance.  The quiet intensity of Bruce Greenwood; the flamboyant, 
almost-snarling sadism of Elias Kosteas; and the nervous timidity of Don 
McKellar breathe vitality into Egoyan's scripted personalities.  However, 
it is Mia Kirshner, with her combination of sensuality and thinly-veiled 
pain, who arrests the viewer's attention.   </P>
<P>     Comparisons to Mike Leigh's NAKED and the uncompromising work of
Ken Loach are entirely appropriate.  As movies go, this one is
painful--painful because it exposes so much truth.  It is a "response"
film that demands something more active than detached observation.
EXOTICA becomes a journey of self-discovery.  As the mysteries
underlying the actions of Francis, Christina, Eric, and Thomas are
slowly unwrapped, we learn as much about ourselves as we do about
Egoyan's characters.  When any motion picture succeeds at that, it
deserves recognition as nothing less than one of the year's most
profound cinematic experiences.</P>
