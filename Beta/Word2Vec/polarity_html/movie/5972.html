<P>     I can't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time
I was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during FEELING MINNESOTA.
For forty minutes or so, I was lured into a loopy if occasionally
over-wrought romantic comedy, and I was even giving Keanu Reeves the
benefit of the doubt.  Then, rather suddenly, I was clubbed over the head
with a nasty bit of violence; shortly thereafter, I was whacked in the gut
by another.  FEELING MINNESOTA is a film that made me feel violated, as
though I had trusted writer-director Steven Baigelman to bring me a cool
glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face.</P>
<P>     FEELING MINNESOTA tells the story of a topless dancer named Freddie
(Cameron Diaz) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss Red (Delroy
Lindo) suspects her of stealing from him.  Red's punishment is to force
Freddie to marry his bookkeeper, Sam Clayton (Vincent D'Onofrio), who is
far from the man of Freddie's dreams.  Enter Jjaks (Keanu Reeves), Sam's
estranged younger brother, who arrives at the wedding just in time to
catch Freddie's eye and have sex with her in the bathroom.  United in
their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of Sam, Jjaks and
Freddie take off together, but Sam isn't ready to let them go without a
fight.  Freddie, meanwhile, isn't ready to let Sam's money go without a
fight, and thus begins a series of violent confrontations.</P>
<P>     There is both style and substance to the beginning of FEELING
MINNESOTA, as Baigelman opens with an effective montage showing Jjaks and
Sam's intense sibling rivalry as boys, and their mother (Tuesday Weld)
sending Jjaks away to live with his father.  It does a great job of
setting up Jjaks' unstable life, a life which has landed him in trouble
for petty crimes and always trying to please his family; Reeves' wounded
look is just right for Jjaks.  The wedding sequence includes a number of
nice moments, most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a
simple question is given a very funny spin.  Most important, Baigelman
begins to establish the connection between Freddie and Jjaks with humor
and economy, as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing
along to the Replacements' "I Will Dare" on the car radio.  You would have
every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic --
would be the focal point of FEELING MINNESOTA.  Unfortunately, you would
be dead wrong.</P>
<P>     I suppose I should have expected daisies and valentines after an
early scene in which Red threatens Freddie as she tries to avoid the
wedding, but I certainly didn't expect what I got.  What I got was yet
another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the Tarantino wave
by mixing gags and brutality, or rather creating gags about brutality.
Suddenly, the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes
a story about a corpse, and everything which had come before degenerates
so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable.  The sibling rivalry
not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings
after another, but there is no consistency to the characterizations.
Vincent D'Onofrio turns in a manic performance as Sam, whose jealousy,
competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping
with what we know about Jjaks, while Reeves turns into a framed hero too
reminiscent of CHAIN REACTION, and both of them spend most of the second
half of the film screaming and covered in blood.</P>
<P>     There are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone
successfully (Jonathan Demme's SOMETHING WILD and Neil Jordan's THE CRYING
GAME come to mind), but they didn't try to draw an audience with the
promise of relatively innocuous entertainment.  I don't want to dismiss
Baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of Dan
Aykroyd as a crooked cop, and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is
not his fault that Fine Line has chosen to promote FEELING MINNESOTA as a
light-hearted caper.  It _is_ his fault that he violates his own
characters for the sake of shock value, and that he can't make his two
halves into a whole.  FEELING MINNESOTA left me feeling used, and there's
not much funny about that.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 bad feelings:  4.</PRE>
