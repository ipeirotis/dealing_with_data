<P>     Calligraphy is one subject that not many movies have explored, and 
none has approached it in quite the way that British director Peter 
Greenaway does in his latest motion picture, THE PILLOW BOOK.  To use 
the film's own words to describe it, this is about the "two things in 
life that are dependable:  the delights of the flesh and the delights of 
literature" and how they can be melded into one.  If you're looking for 
something off the beaten path this summer, THE PILLOW BOOK won't 
disappoint.  Whatever its shortcomings, this film is different.</P>
<P>     Of course, considering the director, that's hardly surprising.  
Greenaway has routinely spurned traditional movie making techniques, 
preferring to use celluloid as an experimental canvas.  His reputation 
has been formed largely as a result of a series of intriguingly 
unconventional motion pictures, including PROSPERO'S BOOKS, a bizarre 
re-invention of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST, and THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS 
WIFE AND HER LOVER, a twisted fable about an eloquent gangster getting 
his just desserts.  The closest Greenaway has ever come to being 
mainstream is THE COOK, but, considering the relatively widespread 
distribution that THE PILLOW BOOK is likely to receive, that may change.</P>
<P>     While there's nothing especially groundbreaking or difficult to 
grasp in THE PILLOW BOOK, Greenaway's experimentation here still has the 
power to alienate audiences who aren't prepared for what the film 
offers.  As has been true in his past efforts, there are copious amounts 
of full frontal nudity, and it seems that lead actors Vivian Wu (THE JOY 
LUCK CLUB) and Ewan McGregor (TRAINSPOTTING) perform half of their 
scenes without any clothes on.  Nevertheless, by keeping the audience at 
arm's length, Greenaway manages the impressive feat of de-eroticizing 
the nudity.</P>
<P>     For the most part, the director seems more concerned about 
technique than narrative and character development.  The plot functions 
more as a series of markers for Greenaway's stylistic riffs than a 
necessary aspect of the movie.  Indeed, THE PILLOW BOOK is so visually 
arresting that it's capable of holding our attention for two hours 
largely on the strength of its images.  There are pictures-within-
pictures, French song lyrics rolling across the bottom of the screen, 
multiple aspect ratios, color bleeding into black-and-white scenes, and 
other intriguing methods of composition.  Even simple shots, such as a 
swirl of ink-saturated water being sucked into a drain -- a color image 
that's all black-and-white -- can be striking.  And, for those who enjoy 
a little bafflement, there's a sequence near the end where the dialogue 
is in Japanese, but Greenaway intentionally does not use subtitles.</P>
<P>     The only character of any real importance in THE PILLOW BOOK is 
Nagiko, a Japanese-born fashion model with obsessions for calligraphy, 
physical pleasure, and revenge.  When she's a child, her loving father 
(Ken Ogata), a master calligrapher, paints a traditional blessing on her 
face every birthday.  Nagiko adores her father almost to the point of 
worship, and is horrified to learn that, to get his work published, he 
has to submit to homosexual relations with his publisher (Yoshi Oida).  
To make matters worse, that same publisher arranges for Nagiko to be 
trapped into marrying a cruel, callous man who views her as an object, 
not a person.  Eventually, fed up with her life, she flees Japan for 
Hong Kong, where she begins her career.</P>
<P>     When she was little, Nagiko's aunt would read her excerpts from the 
PILLOW BOOK OF SEI SHONAGON, the 1000-year old diary of a courtesan.  In 
Hong Kong, Nagiko begins her own pillow book, but, instead of writing on 
paper, she uses the bodies of her lovers.  They, in turn, utilize her 
flesh for their calligraphy.  Nagiko's quest is for the perfect 
lover/calligrapher combination, but it becomes a difficult search.  As 
she says, the older men are not interested in the pleasure she can 
provide, and the younger men are easily distracted.  Then she meets 
Jerome (Ewan McGregor), an Englishman in Hong Kong, who proves not only 
to be her artistic match, but offers the means by which she can enact a 
long-dormant plan of vengeance against her father's publisher.</P>
<P>     As Nagiko, Vivian Wu gives an impressive performance, using her 
bare skin as a tablet for the calligrapher's ink and her acting ability 
as a means to flesh out her character.  Ultimately, Nagiko becomes the 
only well-realized personality in THE PILLOW BOOK.  The supporting 
characters who surround her, including Ewan McGregor's Jerome, are 
shallow and thinly-realized, often functioning more as plot devices than 
individuals.  Wu's Nagiko is THE PILLOW BOOK's only truly human element. </P>
<P>     There's something admittedly fascinating about the way Greenaway 
explores this mixture of calligraphy and the human form.  However, as 
unique as this combination may be, it's actually one of THE PILLOW 
BOOK's few original ideas.  Other directors may hesitate to venture into 
such unfamiliar territory, but Greenaway has been here before.  In its 
approach to sexual obsession, art, and revenge, THE PILLOW BOOK often 
recalls THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER, sometimes almost to 
the point of cannibalization.  Visually, however, THE PILLOW BOOK erupts 
in a manner that causes THE COOK (which was stylistically memorable in 
its own right) to pale in comparison.</P>
<P>     The great irony of this film, which is (at least on one level) 
about the power of writing, is that the words are of secondary 
importance to the overwhelming visual presentation.  The camera, not the 
script, dominates our response to Greenaway's film.  In the final 
analysis, THE PILLOW BOOK has much more to show than it has to say.</P>
