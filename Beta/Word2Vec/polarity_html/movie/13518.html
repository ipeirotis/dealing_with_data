<PRE>The Meteor that Failed to Impact=20</PRE>
<P>If I were to plot a graph of year against movie-plot-ridiculity for =
Hollywood movies, you'll probably see a line with constant gradient. =
Now, if I were to plot that same graph for the movies that the Michael =
Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer has made over the last 4 years, that line would be =
exponential in growth. The team started out with the Will Smith vehicle =
BAD BOYS which was no more than a 2hr long action-music-video, =
nevertheless entertaining. Then came THE ROCK, where audiences flocked =
to see NICHOLAS CAGE team up with SEAN CONNERY against some terrorizing =
general fighting over some stupid cause. CON-AIR was ridiculousy dumb in =
its premise but it did have fun moments, and who can forget the nursery =
rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by STEVE BUSCEMI. While these =
movies worked because there was something better to cover-up the dirt, =
ARMAGEDDON does not.</P>
<P>Very much like DEEP IMPACT, a meteor is heading towards Earth and they =
didn't realize it until 18 days from impact. DEEP IMPACT settled with =
the modest meteor size as large as the city of New York but ARMAGEDDON =
just had to be BIGGER....well about the size of Texas (that kinda meteor =
whould probably knock Earth out of its orbit!). The panic of this =
sighting spurs the idea of landing people on the meteor, drill it then =
nuke it (sounds familiar) and who better to do such a job than Harry =
Stamper  (Bruce Willis), your very own oil-driller extraordinaire and =
his team of macho-misfits, nursing the tagline `there ain't nothin' on =
this planet that Harry can't drill!'. In that 18 days, Harry's group was =
split into 2 teams, trained for deep-space flight and finally blasted =
into space in with special drilling vehicles on 2 new space shuttles.</P>
<P>The main relationship drama of ARMAGEDDON is formed within the =
relationship of Harry, A.J. and Grace. To give you an idea, A.J. works =
for Harry, and loves Grace, Harry's daughter.  The problem is, Harry =
hates to see his daughter hanging around some scruffy grunt like himself =
for the rest of her life. So while A.J. and Harry struts it out, Grace =
is place in a position where she is unable to take sides, so she remains =
seated in the NASA control tower, crying over both of them in about 80% =
of the movie.</P>
<P>The human elements this movie tries to inject proves to be nothing more =
than just an excuse for more slow-mo's and gold-tinted photography. The =
anguish of the world is potrayed with scenes of people praying, running =
for their lives or just sitting still staring at the sky, sounds fine =
right? I know, but it looks too out of place on screen, too staged. If =
you were to ask yourself, `What's the difference between ARMAGEDDON and =
a R&B music video?" you'd probably just said `The music.". Not =
surprising since Michael Bay is a child of that industry and has =
actually managed to transpose his MTV skills to screen successfully. His =
foray into ARMAGEDDON just proves that he doesn't when to stop.</P>
<P>Well there's really nothing much to sum up here. The =
Stock-Aitken-Waterman of Hollywood Movies have projected their art-form =
into ridiculity, beyond the plane believability, where people still =
accept even if they didn't believe. DEEP IMPACT was ridiculous in most =
aspects and I believe the makers know this. The thing is, they decided =
to shroud myth and fantasy with a purely believable human tale of =
suffering and coming in terms with ones problems, which ultimately =
brought it above the ashes which it had initially put itself in. =
ARMAGEDDON, is an overcrowded, loud, messy, preposterously manipulative =
waste of money and deserves to remain in that same pile of ash..=20</P>
<P>If you have planned to watched this over DEEP IMPACT because of Liv =
Tyler, Bruce Willis or the tagline "From the makers of `THE ROCK'!!". =
Please catch DEEP IMPACT before it finishes its run, it may be the only =
meteor worth watching in long-long time. If you have to see it, please =
bring ear-plugs and some aspirins (for the vertigo). Expect ARMAGEDDON =
LD's to retail at S$19.90 at CarreFour come release time. Gee......even =
that's not worth it!</P>
