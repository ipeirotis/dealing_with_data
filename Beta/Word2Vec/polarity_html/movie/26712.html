<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Brian De Palma is a commercial filmmaker who imitates other noted
filmmakers but has not met with the same artistic success as a Hitchcock
or a Coppola, ones he in particular gravitates towards; but, by adding
his own brand of sleek cinematography and gratuitous violent action
scenes to jazz his films up, he at least salvages some identity of his
own. This film is mostly imitative of Michelangelo Antonioni's art-house
film Blow-Up (1966) and somewhat of Francis Coppola's The Conversation
(1974). But what Antonioni does, is make you wish to penetrate his film,
he makes you think about what you are seeing. Coppola will challenge you
to have a political view of what you are seeing. Their films are so
well-received as art films because they go beneath the surface of
things, they have something to say. While De Palma's films are all
surface vehicles, there is nothing to think about. His films are pretty
to look at and are good at simulating what an art film is, but they are
more interested in being entertaining than anything else. Therefore,
even if "Blow Out" pretends to be like the above mentioned films, it is
in style only. This film will prove itself in the end to be without
sufficient weight to be put in the heavyweight class. It's mired in the
lightweight class, working as an effective film mostly because it has a
sense of humor and Travolta is convincing as the unlikely hero fighting
against political corruption.</P>
<P>It is a thriller set in Philadelphia, where Jack Terry (John Travolta)
is a sound man on "B" horror movies. Jack worked two years for the
police to wire undercover agents exposing corrupt policemen, but he
quits because an agent he worked with got killed when he was spotted
being miked. He is currently working with Sam (Boyden), knocking off as
many as 5 cheap films a year. The running gag is that he needs a perfect
scream for his current film, a Psycho-like one, with a shower slashing
scene, and the actresses auditioned can't give a realistic one. You can
guess where he gets a perfect realistic scream by the film's conclusion.</P>
<P>One night recording the outdoor sounds for his film, he witnesses a car
go over the bridge railing and into the river below. Instinctively, he
jumps in and saves the pretty woman, but the man in the car is already
dead.</P>
<P>When he is at the hospital, he learns that the dead man was the governor
of the state and that he's running for president, and that the girl in
the car is a hooker named Sally (Nancy Allen-the then-wife of the
director). One of the governor's aides (McMartin) asks him to cover it
up that there was a girl in the car, since he was a family man and it
wouldn't look right. This is an obvious reference to Teddy Kennedy's
Chappaquidick political scandal.</P>
<P>When questioned by a hostile detective Mackey (Aquino), who knew him
from his cop days, he tells the officer it wasn't an accident as
reported to the newspapers, but that the tire was shot out. He knows
this since he audiotaped the car crash and can clearly hear two bangs,
one of which he is sure is a gunshot, while the other is the tire
blowout.</P>
<P>Jack gets angry when he discovers there was a sleazy photographer, Manny
(Dennis Franz), who happened to be there at the time of the accident and
has taken pictures of it, which he sells to a magazine for a hefty fee.
Jack gets the magazine photos and links his sound to the still photos.
When completed, Jack is absolutely sure it was the gunshot from an
assassin he heard. He goes to Mackey with this evidence, who says he
doesn't believe him but will check out his tape anyway because that's
his job. But the assassin Burke (John Lithgow) went to his studio and
erased the tapes, so what he has given the police is nothing but a blank
tape.</P>
<P>The film was taut and exciting to this point, but there are several
breakdowns in the story, as it veers into the slasher film mode. Jack
figures out that Sally and Manny worked together setting the
presidential candidate up for a compromising photo. The attention of the
film goes no deeper than seeing if he can get Sally to now help him
prove it was a murder and if he can  keep her alive. The film also asks,
will the police believe him and can he stop the assassin? It
unsuccessfully tries to work a conspiracy theory into the mystery.</P>
<P>De Palma has moved solidly into mundane territory, jettisoning ideas in
favor of high-tech shots and thrilling action scenes. "Blow Out" has
moved into the range of the unbelievable horror films, worrying more
about special effects than about having an intelligent story.</P>
<P>The political agenda of the film, a reaction against the right-wing
Reagan types, becomes apparent in the film's climactic scenes, where
Jack is caught at the "Liberty Day" celebration of the 100th anniversary
of the Liberty Bell. The action takes place in the crowded streets of
Philly, as he has Sally miked just like he had the agent when he worked
for the police. But, the right-wing fanatic Burke has fooled her into
thinking he is the newspaper reporter (May) who is going to expose the
cover up on TV and she meets him to give him the tapes. Politics is seen
as being as corrupt and dirty as ever, even so soon after Watergate, as
those involved in it are still capable of using any means possible to
get elected.</P>
<P>This was not the gloomy theme the public wanted to see, as "Blow Out"
was never popular in its day. It had received mixed reviews from the
major film critics at the time, but the film, even though it was an
uneven one, has caught the attention of some current film critics and
film buffs, and is now established as a cult-favorite. I thought it was
limited in scope but because of the flashy camerawork, the fine
performances by both Travolta (his first major starring role) and
Lithgow, and the many thrills it provided, it was easy to watch and just
as easy to put out of my mind.</P>
