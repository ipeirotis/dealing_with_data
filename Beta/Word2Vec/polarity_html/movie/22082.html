<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The brilliant cinematography in this slasher thriller is what takes it
out of the ordinary realm of such films and makes it into a diverting
and more artistic venture. Esteemed cult director, Donald Cammell
(Performance/Demon Seed/The Wild Side), has never quite lived up to the
potential he showed in the masterpiece he co-directed, "Performance." He
tragically in April 1996, shot himself through the head, mirroring the
bizarre ending scene of  "Performance."</P>
<P>In "WHITE OF THE EYE " he shows an artistic eye for odd details that he
catches with his sexy camera, as he heads to the Tuscon, Arizona area
and follows a gruesome, woman hating, serial killer around. The film
opens as an attractive, wealthy housewife leaves Goldwaters Deparment
Store and is followed home by a psychopath. Her last phone conversation
to a friend is a complaint about her hair cut. Her bad hair day will
pale in comparison to what happens to her next, as the unseen psychopath
ritualistically slices her up and leaves on the table an ancient
mystical Indian sign.</P>
<P>Detective Charles Mendoza (Art Evans) investigating the crime scene, is
impressed by the Picasso cubist style of the killer. This is the second
such ritualistic killing in Arizona within the year, but this time there
is a break in the case, as truck tire tracks are found at the scene and
the police are able to say for sure that there were only 44 sets of
those expensive tires recently sold in the Arizona area and they have
the names of all the owners.</P>
<P>Paul White (David Keith) is an expert soundman, an artist in putting in
upgraded stereo equipment for his wealthy clients. The part Indian
native of the former mining town of Globe, who has been a good citizen
as an adult but who has a criminal record as a juvenile, and is now a
suspect because his tires match those at the crime scene, and it is now
up to the cops to track down all the other tire owners and narrow their
field of suspects.</P>
<P>The story is told in flashback, as it goes back to an earlier time when
Paul is asked to fix a damaged car stereo system by a bickering New York
City couple heading to Malibu Beach. The attractive Joan (Cathy
Moriarty) is ticked off at her violent boyfriend, Mike (Rosenberg), and
purposefully damages his prized car stereo system. They find Paul's
trailer and he is able to fix the stereo, go hunting mule deer with
Mike, and he will walk off with Mike's woman, as it seems there was an
immediate attraction between the two.</P>
<P>Mike has disappeared from the scene and it is now 10-years later, and
Paul and Joan have a young girl (Danielle Smith), and seem to be madly
in love with each other, though Joan is a wee bit jealous that a rich
movie actress, who happens to be a stunner, Ann Mason (Alberta Watson),
has eyes on her man. Assuming that Paul is having hanky-panky with Ann,
as she spies on him and spots his truck at her residence, she lets the
air out of his tires.</P>
<P>The next day, Paul is questioned by the detectives, as there was another
ritualistic killing of an attractive woman, who happens to be the next
door neighbor of Ann Mason. But with Joan explaining what she did, the
detectives, though still very suspicious of Paul, let him go for the
time being.</P>
<P>The question comes, is Paul being framed for the killings- or is he the
killer? The only other logical suspect, whom the police don't know
about, is Mike. He has returned to live in an abandoned mine, telling
Joan, whom he accidently meets in a gas station, that he is a changed
man after spending some hard time in Attica prison, and has come back to
Globe to trace his Indian roots.</P>
<P>What is meant by the film's title, refers to an Apache legend about
those who look into the eye of violence close-up, which allows the
mystical eye to have his eye on you. As a film about mysticism, it fails
badly to materialize as anything but nonsense.</P>
<P>For a film that has such a weak story and fails to be absorbing as a
character study, this is, nevertheless, a well-crafted visual spectacle,
featuring an array of beautifully stylized color co-ordinated scenes and
out-of-the-way shots, that have little to do with the story, but overall
they create a bizarre atmosphere that fits the brooding mood of the film
to a tee. If it is the mystery story itself that you are looking for,
I'm afraid you will be disappointed, as it adds up to nothing much. But
in those visual shots... there is a real passion that the director has
shown for filming a ritualistic killing and highlighting the outward
beauty he sees in a woman. It might disappoint some, who think Cammell
could have made something more than a slasher film; but, then again, his
strength is through his eye, no matter how distorted it may be, and even
in this low-rent type of film, his images remain strong and his themes
have a strange complexity about them, enabling the film to be oddly
effective, even when it shouldn't be.</P>
