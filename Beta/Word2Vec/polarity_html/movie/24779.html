<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A silly film that tries to be a black comedy but plays more like
lightweight comedy, with its main asset being a beautiful film location
along Spain's mountainous coastline. Howard Pigeon (Jeff Goldblum) is a
40-year-old mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife
constantly nagging him, Elizabeth (Mimi Rogers). After a surprise
birthday party for him, where his wife bawls him out for coming late to
his surprise party, he confides to his best friend that he can't stand
it anymore, and then tells him his plan to kill her while vacationing in
the same Barcelona hotel where they spent their honeymoon.</P>
<P>Jeff is going through a severe mid-life crises, worried that he looks
older than his age. He incessantly talks to himself, mostly agonizing
over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with
Elizabeth for a second time, and then why he married her just because
she laughed at his jokes and was attractive. He stutters and acts like a
man who has lost his confidence.</P>
<P>Things change on their vacation, as Elizabeth makes an effort to be nice
while Jeff now becomes the grouch. He nervously rehearses his murder
plan in the hotel room. By accident the gun goes off and into the pillow
where he imagined Elizabeth would be sitting. When other hotel guests
and staff come to check about the gunshot, he nervously explains that it
was the TV. Realizing how unworkable his plan is, he places the gun in
the shattered pillow and throws it into the ocean while he waits for
Elizabeth. But Elizabeth found his behavior odd during the entire trip,
and when after a great deal of effort to get a reservation at the
hotel's 5 star restaurant he insists on eating in the room, she decides
she had enough of him and checks out without telling him. As a result,
he goes to the police to report her missing.</P>
<P>While with the police, a telegram comes from his wife saying she left
him and is going away because she wants to be alone. His boss and all
those he works with are sympathetic to him, and he gets a job promotion.
But soon the pillow with the gun is fished out of the water, giving the
police cause to arrest him and search his home. There they find letters
he has written incriminating him to the murder. The police also find out
from the hotel staff about the gunshot heard in his room.</P>
<P>In jail, things look bad for him. No one believes him, including his
friends and lawyer. His boss fires him and the papers have a field day
with the headline story: Pigeon: A Jailbird.
Out on bail, he realizes that his only hope is to track down his wife.</P>
<P>Through a call placed on his credit card, he tracks her down to a
mountain resort. Once there he learns that she took a hike up the steep
mountain and he gets a priest to be his mountain guide after telling him
the true story.</P>
<P>The film is watchable just for the antics of the Jeff Goldblum comic
performance. He is someone coming apart by the seams, while Mimi Rogers
is his perfect foil. It was mostly pantomine humor, with the comedy
charged in the changing facial expressions of the characters and the
absurdity of the situation. A very minor farce that might appeal to the
sitcom crowd. The film just didn't take its situation seriously and the
story had many gaps in it, so it had no chance for black humor to
develop. It instead played its set-up of the henpecked husband acting
out his fantasy strictly for entertainment value to see how many
chuckles it could draw.</P>
