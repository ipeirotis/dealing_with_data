<P>     To lose a child is perhaps the greatest tragedy any person can
endure.  When something like that happens because of a drunk driver, it
raises a specter of impotent fury that no dose of reason can ever
dispel.  In Sean Penn's THE CROSSING GUARD, a flawed but thought-
provoking motion picture, Jack Nicholson's Freddy Gale has opened his
arms to the embrace of anguish and hatred.  Nothing--not the pleas of
his ex-wife Mary (Angelica Huston) or the excesses of drink and sex to
which he succumbs--allows him to forget, or, more importantly,
forgive.</P>
<P>     The problem with THE CROSSING GUARD is not the premise or core
theme, but the manner in which director Sean Penn breathes life into the
story.  This film is horribly unfocused.  Significant chunks of screen
time are devoted to unrelated, superfluous, and cryptic sequences.  Many
apparently have been included for the purpose of enhanced
characterization, but, since basic character development is handled
effectively early in the movie, much of this material is redundant.  How
many times do we have to be reminded that Freddy is on the edge?  How
often must John Booth, the drunk driver who killed Freddy's daughter,
wrestle with his guilt?</P>
<P>     THE CROSSING GUARD opens on the day John (David Morse) is released
from prison after serving a five-year sentence for manslaughter.  While
his ordeal behind bars hasn't broken him, the knowledge of his crime
weighs down his conscience like an anchor--so much so that a potential
girlfriend (Robin Wright) tells him she can't compete with his guilt.
As John, Morse gives a powerful, contained performance that is all the
more effective because it is so controlled.  Despite what he did, we
feel for him.</P>
<P>     Nicholson, on the other hand, is uneven playing a father who is
self-destructing under the pressure of his grief.  The death of his
daughter Emily ruined Freddy's life, and, in his opinion, a prison term
was too mild a penalty for John.  Freddy intends to repay the drunk
driver with a calculated, cold-blooded murder.  Much of Nicholson's
portrayal involves over-the-top ranting (the actor's usual shtick),
which becomes tiresome.  Fortunately, there are scenes where he is
restrained, and there's a palpable tension to those moments.</P>
<P>     When Penn hits the right tone, his direction shows undeniable
power.  THE CROSSING GUARD contains several noteworthy scenes.  One,
which illustrates the potency of Freddy's bereavement better than all of
Nicholson's ravings, has Freddy silently watching a loving father and
daughter hug.  Another has John visiting the grave of his victim.  A
third takes place in a coffee shop, where Freddy and Mary perform an
autopsy of their marriage.  Then there's John's description of what it
was like to watch Emily die.  Had all of THE CROSSING GUARD been put
together with such deft skill, this could have been an amazing motion
picture.  Alas, what's on-screen too often devolves into ineffective
melodrama.</P>
<P>     With strippers dressed as little girls, a father's unquenchable
grief, and a climax that brings the situation to an emotional crescendo,
comparisons between THE CROSSING GUARD and Atom Egoyan's EXOTICA are
inevitable.  In any such point-by-point study, however, Sean Penn's
film, with its spotty treatment of powerful emotional topics, does not
fare favorably.  On balance, THE CROSSING GUARD probably succeeds more
often than not, but there are enough serious missteps to raise doubts
about whether this film is worth a trip to a theater.</P>
