<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It should duly be noted this film won best film for 2000 by both the New
York Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics over the
popular other Taiwanese film nominated, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
Edward Yang (A Brighter Summer Day (1991)) wrote and directed Yi Yi;
it's a 173-minute, contemporary film set in Taipei, about the
middle-class Jian family and their individual struggles to find
happiness. The family includes: the taciturn father NJ (Wu Nienjen), the
sullen mother Min-Min (Elaine Jin), the sexually awakening high-school
daughter Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee), the precocious eight year old Yang-Yang
(Jonathan Chang), and the feeling too old grandmother (Tang Ruyun). They
are all overwhelmed by what is happening to them, and feel stuck and all
alone. They don't know how to communicate with each other, as each is
deeply troubled by their own concerns.</P>
<P>The movie begins with the chaotic wedding preparations for the groom,
A-Di (Chen Xisheng). He's Min-Min's brother and partner in a failing
software computer business with her husband. The blustering hustler's
uncouth bride, Xiao Yan (Xiao Shushen), is very obviously pregnant and
is marrying him at this late date because he superstitiously follows the
horoscope and this is listed as an auspicious day for the wedding. The
family looks very awkward together at the reception -  a portrait of the
bride and groom is not hung correctly, the family rigidly poses for
their wedding picture, and the groom's jilted girlfriend arrives
inebriated and uninvited; and, she then becomes hysterical upsetting the
reception.</P>
<P>By chance, NJ meets in the hotel lobby of the wedding reception his old
high-school flame, Sherry (Ke Suyun). He will say later on that she is
the only one he has ever loved, but for some unexplained reason he
failed to meet her at a critical time of their relationship and they
have not seen each other for over 20 years. She now lives in Chicago and
is married to a wealthy American businessman, who is doing business in
China.</P>
<P>Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee) feels guilty that granny has a stroke. At home,
right after the wedding, she failed to take out the garbage in their
luxury hi-rise apartment and granny was found lying in the driveway next
to the dust bins. She believes granny was taking out the trash in place
of her. Granny is discharged from the hospital; and, while at home, she
remains bed-ridden and in a comatose state. The doctor suggests that
part of the family therapy should be that they each talk to her so that
she knows they care about her and this could stimulate her to awaken.
She will not awaken from that state, except later on when the saddened
teenage daughter has a fantasy scene that granny comforts her. When the
family members try to communicate with granny, none of them can. The
wife is upset that her life is in a rut and can only tell her trivial
things. The teenage girl prefers to play the piano for her. The young
kid doesn't know what to say. NJ can only suggest that the nurse reads
to her from the newspapers. While grandmother's son could only
shamefully boast that she shouldn't have worried so much about his bad
habits and the way he always borrowed money from others, he has now
invested wisely in stocks and is a rich man.</P>
<P>Within a few days Min-Min has a nervous breakdown and retreats to the
mountain spot where her guru will counsel her. The futility of this
venture is seen from the onset, when NJ writes the guru a check for his
services. The mother will be gone in her religious retreat, while each
member of the family goes through a crisis of their own. When she
returns, she reports that nothing has changed for her.</P>
<P>NJ's midlife crisis is played out in Tokyo where he goes to court for
his firm the only adult in the film he really respects, a Japanese
inventor of computer games, Ota (Issey Ogata). The two developed an
honest and intense relationship while Ota was in Taipei pitching his
product. Both NJ's company and Ota have fallen on hard times, and need
to have some cash flowing in; nevertheless, they are more concerned with
their individual needs. While in Tokyo he will also court the only one
he loves, as Sherry accompanies him there and they try to pick up where
they left off as teenagers. But they seem to run into the same problems
they had back then, an inability to reach each other despite the deep
feelings of love they profess.</P>
<P>Ting-Ting's problems will revolve around her relationship with her new
next door neighbor, a teenager called Lili (Adrian Lin). She immediately
becomes close friends with the cello playing Lili. But later on a
problem of loyalty arises between them, as the agitated boy called
"Fatty" (Yupang Chang) that Lili was going out with is now interested in
her. She has the same trouble in communicating in her relationship with
him, as her father has currently with Sherry in Tokyo.</P>
<P>Yang-Yang is not only the namesake of the director, but speaks for him
in this film.  He tells his father innocently: "I can't see what you see
and you can't see what I see. So how can I know what you see?" His
father gives him a camera and he feels satisfied to take pictures of the
backs of people's heads. He will tell granny when she's dead that he
wants to grow up to tell people what they don't know. He is interested
in discovering the truth people can't see about themselves. At one point
of the film the director through the character who reacts the most
emotional, the very thin "Fatty," tells his movie date that movies are
not a waste of time, but enrich one's life. They even increase your life
three times because the movies tell us about things we could never
possibly know. He gives one example of murder, but that didn't go over
too well with Ting-Ting.</P>
<P>This one is a masterpiece, despite it being as inexplicable as a great
work of music sometimes is. It lays out the grief facing a problematic
family and we see it happening, but we never quite understand why; and,
we will have to accept as an answer that is because individuals are very
complex and if they can't tell us what is on their mind, we can only
guess what they are thinking. And, isn't that the way you find it with
many people? Maybe finding happiness isn't so simple a matter. Maybe we
are destined to follow a certain course and even if given a second
chance would still make the same mistakes. The director knows that we
are all unique and have our own way of seeing things, and he respects
that. But whatever, there was a certain raw, undefinable power that this
great filmmaker has that makes this story fulfilling; even if, we are
never quite sure if we are fulfilled by what we saw. But one thing is
certain, you can't put this iconoclastic filmmaker in a box and label
him. I wouldn't miss this one. As entertaining a film as Crouching
Tiger... was, it didn't have this film's depth and poignancy.</P>
