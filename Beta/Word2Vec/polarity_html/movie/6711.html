<P>     It's an unfortunate thing to start off the 1997 movie season on 
such a low note.  As disaster films go, TURBULENCE is representative of 
the kind of mindless, lifeless nonsense that makes bloated thrillers 
like Stallone's DAYLIGHT seem brilliant by comparison.  Of course, with 
a bad movie of this sort, it's always possible to argue that it can be 
fun if approached in the right frame of mind.  And, indeed, there are 
numerous instances when watching TURBULENCE is more akin to viewing a 
parody like AIRPLANE! than any of the numerous, supposedly-straight 
AIRPORT movies. </P>
<P>     Often with bottom-of-the-barrel cinema, it's possible to make the 
case that a decent premise has been ruined by poor execution.  Not here.  
TURBULENCE was a bad idea from the start, and the film makers continued 
to make mistakes all the way through -- from casting and scripting to 
editing and special effects.  Even the release was mishandled.  This is 
clearly a Christmas movie (all the decorations and tunes offer a none-
too-subtle hint of this), yet, because MGM feared it would get lost in 
the December blitz, they delayed its opening by several weeks.  All 
things considered, I doubt the box office results will be significantly 
different. </P>
<P>     Most of the action in TURBULENCE takes place (no surprises here) on 
a plane.  It's a 747 Christmas Eve flight bound from New York's JFK 
Airport to LAX.  There are seventeen people on board:  the pilot and co-
pilot, four flight attendants, five "regular" passengers, four Federal 
Marshals, and two convicts.  The prisoners are an uncouth bank robber 
named Stubbs (Brendan Gleeson) and a suave, cultured serial killer, Ryan 
Weaver (Ray Liotta).  For a little while, the movie pretends that Ryan 
is an enigma, and hints that he might not be guilty, but, since he's 
being played by veteran psycho Ray Liotta, we know it's only a matter of 
time before he snaps. </P>
<P>     Through a series of amazing contrivances, the pilot and co-pilot 
end up dead, and, with the 747 plunging into a dangerous storm, Ryan is 
chasing around one of the flight attendants, Teri Halloran (Lauren 
Holly), who eventually holes up in the cockpit to try to land the plane.  
Everyone else on board is either conveniently dead or locked in an out-
of-the-way-place where they won't interfere with the amazingly inept 
interaction between the two leads. </P>
<P>     TURBULENCE exceeds any reasonable limit placed on suspension of 
disbelief.  The film is littered with hard-to-swallow implausibilities.  
If landing a 747 is this easy, why is it hard to find trained pilots?  
If the two prisoners are so dangerous, why send them with only four 
guards, and why on an aircraft with passengers?  And how does Ryan 
manage to survive being slugged on the head by a nearly-full fire 
extinguisher?  (I know -- all serial killers in this genre are like cats 
with nine lives.)  </P>
<P>     On top of all that, even if you manage to swallow the plot, you 
still have to deal with some of the worst dialogue around today, much of 
which is delivered at the most inappropriate moments.  As the plane is 
plunging into the heart of the storm, Teri and Ryan have a little chat.  
He asks her what her favorite movie is (GONE WITH THE WIND), what her 
favorite book is (GONE WITH THE WIND again), how old she was when she 
first had sex (18 1/2), and whether she enjoyed it (yes).  Any palpable 
tension drains away as these two babble incessantly in the empty cabin. </P>
<P>     There are more problems with TURBULENCE, but I think I've made the 
point by now.  Considering how many solid leftovers from 1996 are still 
in theaters, I can't think of a reason why anyone would subject 
themselves to this offering.  Unless, that is, you're looking for cheesy 
special effects and a miscast Lauren Holly playing action heroine.  At 
least it's not hard to understand why they called this TURBULENCE -- it 
really is nauseating. </P>
