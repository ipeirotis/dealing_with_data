<PRE>                                DIABOLIQUE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     DIABOLIQUE is a classic thriller and murder mystery that was made
in 1954, but while watching it I thought it was made in the 30s or
40s.  It has the look and feel of one of the original Hitchcock movies
from the 30s.  DIABOLIQUE is showing in limited engagements now in art
houses.  The original uncut version of the movie that is now showing
has fresh looking and handsome black and white prints and has seven
minutes of footage restored.</P>
<P>     I will set up the plot for you, but no more, since the twists in
the movie are the main reason to see it.  The principal of a French
boarding school for (rowdy) boys is played by Paul Meurisse.  His
Spanish wife is played by Vera Clouzot and his mistress by Simone
Signoret.  The other characters are unimportant and not worth
mentioning.  He beats his wife and his mistress so the two women become
good friends, and moreover, they both work at the school.</P>
<P>     Other than the fun script and all of the games it plays convincing
you of one "fact" only to start making you think that just the opposite
is true, the only other outstanding part of the movie is the
cinematography.  It transports you to France and to a time past.  The
feel of the countryside and of the little private school is at once
both hokey and wonderfully evocative of a simpler era.  Watch
especially how the camera will stop and pause on small features like
the dead leaves floating on top of the swimming pool.  The film maker
is careful to focus in menacingly on the expressions on the characters
faces when they are surprised or frighten--very Hitchcockean.</P>
<P>     The problem I had with the film and the reason I did not rate it
higher was the one dimensional acting.  The husband was supposed to be
the canonical cad, but I did not buy Meurisse performance for a
minute.  He was totally unconvincing.</P>
<P>     Signoret did an acceptable job of portraying a character who
showed no emotion at all.  The only interesting work was that of Vera
Clouzot--wife of the director Henri-Georges Clouzot.  Her performance
had some depth, but still she was mainly a stick figure.  Her version
of fear reminded me of a caricature of someone in Acting 101 learning
how to demonstrate fear.</P>
<P>     The movie runs about two hours.  It is not rated but probably
would get an R for the half dozen uses of the F word and the adult
themes.  There is no sex or nudity.  The little violence it has is
realistic, but not bloody or particularly frightening.  It would be
fine for any teenager to see.  I recommend the picture for a fun and
tricky plot and for the nostalgic filming, and I award ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
