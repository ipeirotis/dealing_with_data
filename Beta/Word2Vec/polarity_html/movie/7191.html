<P>     It has been called brave, rousing, and shocking.  At the 1996 
Cannes Film Festival, where it received its world premiere, it was both 
hailed and booed, and received a special jury prize for "originality, 
daring, and audacity."  Ted Turner, who owns Fine Line Features, labeled 
it "really weird."  Britain's EVENING STANDARD called it "beyond the 
bounds of depravity."  Yet for all the opinions floating around about 
how ground-breaking and controversial CRASH is, I found it to be 
something of a letdown.  </P>
<P>     CRASH has a couple of concepts which are, admittedly, fascinating 
and original, but not a whole lot more.  The movie tries to milk these 
themes for one-hundred minutes, but basically runs out of interesting 
material in less than a third of that time.  From the half-hour point 
on, CRASH subsists on style alone.  It's a slim cinematic diet that will 
have viewers squirming in their seats long before the end credits roll.  
Despite all the naked flesh and flashy car accidents, CRASH is basically 
a bore.</P>
<P>     The central premise of CRASH, which writer/director/producer David 
Cronenberg (THE FLY, DEAD RINGERS) has adapted from the book by J.G. 
Ballard, deals with what VARIETY dubbed "auto-eroticism".  The film, 
like the novel, focuses on a group of people who are turned on by car 
accidents.  The more serious the crash, the more powerful the 
stimulation.  Death, danger, dismemberment, and sexuality are all 
interconnected.  Penetration, whether of flesh into flesh, metal into 
metal, or metal into flesh, leads to release, either of sexual energy, 
life, or both.  </P>
<P>     It's well known that for some people, a sense of danger enhances 
sex.  There are the so-called "gaspers" who like to be strangled while 
approaching orgasm.  There are those who crave sadomasochistic role-
playing.  And, as depicted here, there are those who get off on car 
crashes.  They can be participants or observers, but, in the presence of 
such raw destructive power and mayhem, they become aroused.  CRASH 
follows the exploits of five such characters -- three female and two 
male -- all of whom, at one time or another, give themselves over to 
sexual abandon as the result of an automotive disaster.</P>
<P>     The main character, James Ballard (James Spader), who takes his 
name from the book's author, is involved in an open marriage to 
Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger).  The two have sexual encounters with 
others, then come home and make love while telling about the 
experiences.  One day, James is involved in a head-on collision.  The 
driver of the other car is killed; his wife, Dr. Helen Remington (Holly 
Hunter), survives, but is injured.  While James is recovering in the 
hospital, he meets the mysterious Vaughan (Elias Koteas), a friend of 
Helen's with a strange fascination for accident victims.  </P>
<P>     Soon after his release from the hospital, James encounters Helen at 
the police impound for wrecked cars.  The two have a torrid sexual 
encounter which leads to James' initiation into an elite group of men 
and women who intertwine eroticism with crashes.  In addition to James, 
Helen, and Vaughan, there's also a woman named Gabrielle (Rosanna 
Arquette), who wears leather leg braces and metal body supports like 
badges of honor.  She is, in Vaughan's words, reshaping her body through 
the use of modern technology.  Along with James' intrigued-but-reluctant 
wife, these characters explore sexual and physical boundaries, visiting 
accident sites and re-enacting famous collisions (such as those of James 
Dean and Jayne Mansfield).  </P>
<P>     All of this sounds reasonably interesting, and it is, at least for 
about half an hour.  After that, CRASH becomes repetitious and tedious.  
In the wake of the initial flurry of eye-opening material, the film is 
content to re-tread the same ideas, never striking out in new directions 
or offering a different approach.  There's no plot to speak of -- just a 
series of visceral images loosely strung together to approximate a 
narrative.  More importantly and most frustratingly, there's no real 
character development.  The five main figures are ciphers and 
mouthpieces for cryptic ideas, not legitimate personalities.  We never 
connect with them on an emotional, psychological, or intellectual level.  
They're script constructs, necessary only because Cronenberg needs one 
or two-dimensional people to convey certain themes. </P>
<P>     The aspect of CRASH most likely to retain a viewer's attention is 
its style.  Cronenberg, along with cinematographer Peter Suschitzky, has 
given this film a darkly original look, filled with shocking images of 
violent crashes and raw sex.  Unger, Hunter, and Arquette are called 
upon to expose just about everything, and some of the accidents, with 
their twisted metal and shattered glass, seem sickeningly real.  Often, 
watching CRASH makes you feel like a voyeur peeping through blinds or 
glancing covertly at a roadside collision.</P>
<P>     The three females all bring something interesting to their 
performances.  Hunter allows Helen to be uncertain of the implications 
surrounding her newly-discovered fetish, Unger mixes pathos with a 
strangely icy sensuality, and Arquette is both sexy and vulnerable in 
her metal-and-leather outfit.  The standout performance belongs to 
Canadian actor Elias Koteas (EXOTICA), who is provocative and persuasive 
as the Svengali-like leader of the group.  From an acting standpoint, 
the weak link is James Spader, who mistakenly thinks that the blandness 
he exhibited in SEX, LIES, AND VIDEOTAPE serves him well here.  His 
character is poorly developed to begin with; Spader does nothing to 
invest Ballard with any additional life.</P>
<P>     There are many movie-goers who will see CRASH exclusively because 
it has caused such a stir, and many more who will avoid it for the same 
reason.  However, while there is a lot of sex in the film, the NC-17 
rating seems more obligatory than necessary.  There's nothing 
exceptionally graphic or startling here.  If not for the quantity of sex 
shots and the somewhat-kinky nature, a hard R would have been equally 
appropriate.  As for CRASH's substance -- the film presents some 
provocative ideas, but, without characters or a plot to deliver them, 
they have a minimal impact. </P>
