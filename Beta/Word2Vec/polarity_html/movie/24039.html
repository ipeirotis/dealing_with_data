<PRE>LOVE AND BASKETBALL
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>LOVE AND BASKETBALL is a terrible title.  As soon as you hear it, you
expect the movie to be another lame, teenage romantic comedy, which are
a dime a dozen at the cinema with most as forgettable as last week's
lottery numbers.</P>
<P>I'm happy to report that writer/director Gina Prince's LOVE AND
BASKETBALL is an ambitious and successful film that isn't a teen comedy
at all, although the two charming leads, Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps, do
pass through their teen years as part of the story.</P>
<P>Another delightful surprise about the film is that the writer takes an
African-American cast and avoids the clichés that most such films of
late have fallen into.  Either they bulk up on stupidity and profanity
(as in TRIPPIN') or they gloss it up so much (as in LOVE JONES) that the
characters are completely unbelievable.  In LOVE AND BASKETBALL, both of
the main families are genuine with real aspirations and challenges.  And
both of the leads are endearing and eminently likable.</P>
<P>LOVE AND BASKETBALL tells the poignant story of two basketball players,
one of each sex, who are next-door neighbors.  Following a basketball
metaphor, the writer divides the movie into four quarters of their lives
with several years passing between each period.  We watch the players
progress from grade school to high school to college to pros.  Even if
the trajectory of their lives has some predictability, the details have
one surprise after another -- just like real life.</P>
<P>When we meet Monica Wright, she's an 11-year-old, pigtailed,
self-proclaimed tomboy, played with spunk by Kyla Pratt.  She wants to
play basketball with the boys since theirs is the only game going.  The
star of the local playground is her neighbor, Quincy McCall (Glenndon
Chatman), the son of NBA star Zeke McCall (Dennis Haysbert).  Quincy
decides that Monica will be his girl, so they agree upon a 5-second kiss
to seal the deal.  He counts off his seconds like a referee at a
wrestling match.  But, this first romance of theirs doesn't last long.</P>
<P>>From high school to the pros, the leads are played by the same actors,
Sanaa Lathan as Monica and Omar Epps as Quincy, and they are believable
across the entire age range.  To be fair, Lathan steals the show from a
charismatic Epps.  Rather than have both characters be superstars, the
script wisely imbues them with different skill sets.  Both are dedicated
to their game, but being the star player comes naturally to Quincy,
while Monica is a fighter who just barely gets a college offer.</P>
<P>The chemistry between the two is interesting and unusual.  By the time
they reach high school they have effectively become siblings.  When
Quincy's parents fight, he crawls into Monica's window and sleeps on her
floor.  Monica is a one-man or no-man woman, and in high school she
dedicates her life to her sport.  Dating is foreign to her, and her
clothing and hair choices proclaim "not interested!"</P>
<P>Not surprisingly, they eventually become lovers, and you would be
disappointed if they didn't since they clearly need each other and are
so right for one another.  Their lives, however, will go across many
rocky roads.  The pros, in particular, will not be quite what they or
you might have imagined.  Along the way the movie teaches some important
moral lessons, but it is done subtly and never ends up feeling like
Sunday school.</P>
<P>With two stars that you come to care about deeply, the movie's ending
isn't unsatisfying just because it contains a fair amount of
predictability.  But, like the rest of the story, the writer manages to
sneak in lots of little surprises.  By the end, it's kind of hard to
believe that Monica and Quincy are fictional.  And I, for one, would
very much like to hear about their next 4 quarters.</P>
<P>LOVE AND BASKETBALL runs 1:58.  It is rated PG-13 for sexuality and
language.  Although the profanity was reasonably mild, some of the
sexuality stepped over the bounds of what one would reasonably expect to
find in a PG-13 film.  Losing one's virginity, even if we are shown that
they practice safe sex, does not belong in a PG-13 movie.  Absent this
scene and a couple of others, however, it certainly deserves a PG-13
rating.  But with these scenes I do not think it is appropriate for kids
under 13 or 14.</P>
