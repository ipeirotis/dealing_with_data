<P>When Andy leaves for cowboy camp, his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in
his room for old toys.  One of these toys is Wheezy, a penguin with a broken
squeaker.  Woody (Tom Hanks) saddles up Andy's dog and rides out into the yard
to rescue Wheezy.  Woody succeeds in his mission, but doesn't make it back to
the house before Al, the unscrupulous owner of Al's Toy Barn, recognizes Woody
as a rare collector's item and steals him.</P>
<P>Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) leads Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Mr. Potato Head (Don
Rickles), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), and Rex (Wallace Shawn) into the city to
find their friend.  Meanwhile Woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped.  Al
has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950's TV puppet show
"Woody's Round-up" except for a Woody doll.  Now that the collection is
complete, Al plans to sell Woody and his Round-up Gang-Bullseye the horse,
Jessie the cowgirl (Joan Cusack), and Stinky Pete the old prospector (Kelsey
Grammer)-to a toy museum in Japan.  The Gang is happy about the move; they've
been in storage for years waiting for Woody.  If Woody doesn't go with them,
they'll be closed up in a dark box again, possibly forever.  Trying to convince
him to stay with them, Jessie tells Woody how she was abandoned when her owner
grew up, and Woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered.</P>
<P>While Woody ponders whether to go to Japan or to go home to Andy, Buzz and the
boys invade Al's Toy Barn, where the Buzz we know is replaced by another Buzz
who doesn't know he's a toy.  The new Buzz generates the movie's biggest laughs
as he leads the other toys in an assault on "Zurg's fortress" (i.e., Al's
apartment building).</P>
<P>The original "Toy Story" won me over because its central themes reflected a
grown-up sensibility rather than the usual
this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear.  While most kids' movies take the
position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to
fulfill, in "Toy Story" Buzz discovered that he wasn't special, that he was
just like everyone else.  Buzz sank into a suicidal depression, but Woody
showed Buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy
makes a child happy.  In other words, it's okay to be ordinary if you have love
and a purpose in your life.  Most of us probably come to the same conclusion
when we realize that we're not space rangers and we're never going to be.</P>
<P>"Toy Story 2" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the
first movie.  Woody is forced to recognize that Andy will grow up and forget
him and that he will likely be discarded, abandoned, or sealed up in a dark box
in the attic.  This is another big grown-up theme:  everything ends.  The theme
is introduced early in the movie when Woody's arm is torn and Andy places him
on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp.  On the shelf, Woody meets
Wheezy, who's dusty, broken, and forgotten.  The other toys are shocked that
Woody has been "shelved," and they worry that Woody's ride out to the 25-cent
box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt.  After he's stolen, Woody has to
decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with Andy
and his pals.</P>
<P>Of course, in spite of the heavy themes "Toy Story 2" explores, it's also very
funny.  Most of the laughs come from the toys' assault on Al's Toy Barn and on
the apartment building.  The brief substitution of a new, still delusional Buzz
was a welcome surprise; I'd wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the
original without the pompous attitude Buzz displayed in the original.</P>
<P>Most of the vocal performances are first-rate.  Tom Hanks stands out for the
level of enthusiasm he puts into his work.  However, one voice-over also stands
out as horribly miscast.  Kelsey Grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector.
 Although he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on "The Simpsons"
(as Sideshow Bob), Grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice.  He
doesn't have the range to pull off a role like Stinky Pete.</P>
<P>The animation is even better than in the first.  Especially impressive were the
textures of the figures.  We can now see the difference between flesh and
plastic; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys, but now human
skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint.  We can also see that Bo Peep is
porcelain.  As you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the
merchandising -- "Disney and Pixar's 'Toy Story 2'" -- this is Pixar's coming
out party.  To celebrate they appended their first project, a hilarious short
about two desklamps and a rubber ball, to the beginning of the movie.  They
made the short in 1986, which is incredible when one considers the relatively
primitive level of computer technology available then.</P>
<P>On the downside, "Toy Story 2" follows the formula of the original so closely
that the sequel comes off a bit stale, and some sections tend to drag. 
Overall, though, I had a great time and found "Story 2" to be a worthy
successor to the first "Toy Story."</P>
<P>Bottom Line:  This one really is fun for the whole family!</P>
