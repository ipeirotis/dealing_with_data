<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A solid but routine film noir, shot on location in Los Angeles. It is
noteworthy for its great B&W location shots of the busy L.A. streets and
of capturing a noir look of alienation. The plot revolves around the
familiar noir tale of an innocent man trapped in circumstances beyond
his control. André de Toth only directed one other noir film, Pitfall
(48).</P>
<P>Three escaped felons from San Quentin rob a gas station and kill a
motorcycle cop, with one of the men, Morgan (Young), getting severely
wounded. The men split and Morgan
flees to the apartment of an ex-con gone straight, Steve Lacey (Gene
Nelson), who is reluctant to help because he has a good job as an
airplane mechanic and has married a good wife, Ellen (Kirk). Morgan
pulls a gun on him and has an expelled medical doctor who is now a
veterinarian, ex-con Dr. Otto Hessler (Novello), come over to treat his
wounds, but dies in Lacey's apartment before he can be treated. Hessler
flees with Morgan's share of the robbery money, and upon Ellen's urgings
Lacey calls his understanding probation officer (James Bell), just as
the cops arrive at his place.</P>
<P>Lacey is taken to the police station and grilled by Lt. Sims (Sterling
Hayden), a hard-nosed detective, who doesn't believe criminals can
reform. Sims lets him go with a severe warning that he will send him
back to prison if he's involved with the escapees, or if he doesn't
cooperate with him. When Lacey comes back home, the two vicious thugs,
Doc Penny (de Corsia) and Ben Hastings (Bronson), are waiting for him,
and force him to go along with a bank robbery scheme and then to fly
them to Mexico, or else they threaten to kill his wife.</P>
<P>Lacey has no choice but to pretend to cooperate with the escapees, but
figures out a way to foil the robbery and get Sims to be there. Sims
chews toothpicks as a substitute for cigarettes, as he tries to kick the
habit. One of the film's pleasures is in the offhand gestures it makes
to Sim's quirks. When the case is solved, Sims lightens up for the first
time and brings out a cigarette from the pocket of his rumpled suit and
takes one drag from it before throwing it away and putting the toothpick
back in his mouth.</P>
<P>This low-budget B-flick was very entertaining. It has a fast-pace, a
good eye for detail, and some vivid camera shots around Los Angeles,
which made for a tough looking film.</P>
