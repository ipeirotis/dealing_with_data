<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A bitter-sweet fantasy, in the form of a black comedy. It is about day
dreaming and wish fulfillment, as directed by Neil LaBute (In the
Company of Men/Your Friends and Neighbors). This is the first film he's
done that's not written by him, as it was scripted by John C.
Richards/James Flamberg. It is another heartless stab by the director
aimed at the heart of mankind, showing them at their stupidest and
cruelest moments, one that tweaks the sensibilities about American pop
culture and its whimsical effect on the population. It uses the
ridiculous banal plot of a soap opera called 'A Reason to Love' and
manages to get a story that runs parallel. This modern adult fairy tale,
told in the style of the "Wizard of Oz," is also set in Kansas and has
the heroine, ala Dorothy, leaving that rational state for one of
fantasy. The humor comes in how the characters actually fall for the
fantasy they are spoon fed by TV.</P>
<P>Betty (Renée Zellweger) is a naive, rosy-cheeked, cute blonde waitress,
and is married to a philandering used-car dealer Del (Aaron). She is a
fanatical enthusiast of her favorite soap opera, having fallen in love
with the character of Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear), who is played by
an actor named George McCord. She never misses an episode and identifies
solely with a nurse Chloe, even knowing the nurse's lines by heart. As a
positive, the show has motivated her to want to go to nursing school and
keeps her dreaming about a perfect life, something her life is far from.</P>
<P>While watching a videotape of her favorite soap opera's afternoon show
in her room, her husband is involved with a drug deal with a black
father-son hit men team, Charley (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris
Rock), which is going down in their living room. She witnesses the
bloody scalping and murder of her husband, but gets traumatized by what
she sees and develops amnesia. It would take a suspension of disbelief
to take in what ensued after the murder and not question it.</P>
<P>Betty gets into the character of the soap opera and fantasizes that the
dreamboat David Ravell is her real lover she gave up six years ago to
marry the slob Del. The time has come, she decides, for her to leave
Fair Oaks, Kansas and to go to Los Angeles to meet her ex-fiancée again.
She takes a 1997 Buick LeSabre from her dead husband's used-car lot
which, unbeknownst to her, has the missing drugs the hit men want
stashed in the trunk. The film now plays like a road movie, with the
deadly hit men trying to locate her, on a wild goose chase across the
country.</P>
<P>The sweetness that is supposed to be derived from the film, is to come
from the dull-witted but generous characterization of Betty, a people
person, wanting to help everybody, whose dream life is about to merge
with the actual danger she is in, as she lands in Hollywood, looking for
work not as an actress but as a nurse at the same hospital her soap
opera doctor works. Her chance to become a nurse comes about accidently
when she saves the life of an Hispanic who gets shot in front of the
emergency room and she uses the same procedure on the victim as she saw
on one of the episodes. The grateful girlfriend of the victim, Rosa
(Tia), takes her in as a roommate, and the hospital hires her to work in
the pharmacy until they can check her credentials and let her work with
patients.</P>
<P>She meets David and his soap opera honchos at a publicity gathering and
lives out her fantasy dream by having a whirlwind fling with him while
staying in soap opera character all the time. Besides being flattered by
the attention he receives from her, he sees this meeting with her as an
opportunity for him to expand his career and direct an episode with her
playing a nurse, ignoring his belief that she is either a soap opera
groupie or a lunatic, preferring to think of her as an actress from the
Stella Adler Method acting school, who is staying in character just to
get the part. While, she can't see him as the egotist he is, but can
only see him as the talented surgeon, interested in saving lives and
finding only true love.</P>
<P>While she is settling into Hollywood, living out her fantasy dream, the
hit men relentlessly search for her, flashing phony police badges to get
a lead on her whereabouts, waving snap shots of Betty around to
unsuspecting friends of hers, and picking up her trail in Hollywood by
beating the information out of a bar owner. The hit man father has
developed a fantasy about who Betty is and is stuck on the fantasy of
her representing what is good and pure about America, enduring the loud
insults coming from his angry, sociopath son, who savagely rants at him
about his going daffy over a dream. Charlie is at the twilight of his
career as a professional hit man, thinking that this is his last job
before retirement, and he has grown weary-eyed about his life, as often
there is seen sparkles of wisdom coming from his tired expression, as
when he speaks in a soft and sensitive voice, letting go of his cunning
and ruthless nature for a brief respite, forlornly saying that "he's a
garbage man of the human condition."</P>
<P>The film has another gory murder scene, as it breaks the mood of fantasy
and returns to a reality that is even more absurd than the fantasy
world. The hit men find Betty in Rosa's apartment and hold them hostage,
but from her hometown, Sheriff Ballard (Pruitt) and a reporter, Roy
(Crispin), come to Rosa's place in search of the missing Betty. A bloody
shootout occurs and everything that can get straightened out does as a
result of that. Then the film tries for the impossible, to return the
film to a sweet and gentle ending, by having Betty realize that both her
fantasy and real world are able to co-exist. She is invited to appear on
the soap opera for 63 episodes, where the TV show gets all the publicity
they can muster from her celebrity status following the murder story
headlines, and she saves the money earned on the show to go to nursing
school and a trip to Europe. But it was not possible for me to believe
anything about this tale, especially the purported sweet ending tried
for.</P>
<P>This tale was spiced with too much human depravity and insanity, making
Betty to be anything but another Dorothy Gale, but more like a crazy
person or an idiot. I found this adult fairy tale to be one that was
trapped in its own mixture of cynicism and delusions. The director could
never quite decide on what he wanted Betty to be like, so I was left
with the impression that she was a cartoon-like character, not able to
distinguish what was real or fantasy.</P>
<P>I don't think the film has come up with some earth shattering things to
say about pop culture, except to imply that if you want to be a moron
and forego taste, then join the middle-brow masses and get absorbed in
soap operas and forego any kind of art that makes you think for
yourself. If you do, the director is saying, that is not the worst thing
that can happen to you, it doesn't have to kill you. The question for
Betty becomes one of living out her childish dreams. She realizes her
dreams: of meeting her imagined lover and appearing on his show, of
going to Europe, of leaving Kansas for the first time, and of becoming a
nurse. But it is never clear what LaBute thinks of this, that is, after
smashing the middle-class dream of America as something that is drab. Is
he further saying that it is better to have some dream no matter how
futile it is than no dream at all? If his other two nihilistic films are
examples of his thinking, then I think he is trying to bring that same
message into this work, even though it might not have been intended in
this script and doesn't exactly jive with the sweet ending tried for. I
just think it seemed like old hat material recycled.</P>
<P>What the film had going for it was some marvelous performances,
especially by Morgan Freeman, who touched the soul of his complicated
character, a wickedly carnal performance from Chris Rock, and from Greg
Kinnear, who caught the subtlety needed for his role, to swing back and
forth between TV actor and real character. As for Renée Zellweger's
performance, it was good, that is, as good as any on the soaps.</P>
