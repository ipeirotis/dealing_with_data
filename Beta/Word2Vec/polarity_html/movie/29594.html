<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Director/writer Sergio M. Castilla (Gringuito) is a native Chilean who divides
his time between Brooklyn and Santiago. He has taught film at Columbia
University and NYU, and has said that he made this film because he can't
remember as a youth watching films that were made in Chile. </P>
<P>Te Amo is a movie about the lingering effects on society from the years from
1973-1990 that Chile suffered under the dictatorship of Pinochet, and of how
lonely and wounded the kids of that lost generation are today. Castilla believes
it is a ruined generation, where the children keep a dark inward side of
themselves as a secret. This film was inspired after he saw his son Adrian in
the play Midsummer Night's Dream and recruited the other kids into his workshop
to create a play about the revelations of growing up in Santiago, Chile, for
such abandoned teenagers. The film was written spontaneously while at the
workshop to fit the emotions of the teenage actors recruited. </P>
<P>Te Amo is about four struggling teens in Santiago attending the same special
American high school, who struggle to create a world for themselves during their
summer vacation. The four wealthy teens are: Sam Moscovitz (Adrian Castilla-the
director's son), who is an abandoned 16-year-old living with his Chilean type-A
business mother after his Jewish American father of Chilean descent and his
mother are divorced; Mike (Joshua Walker), who is all gringo and is a revolting
pothead with a gift for talking trash, whose American father is an extremely
wealthy exporter of Chile' onions; Daniella (Ropert), a native Chilean whose
father is a drunk and her mother is deceased, as she's being raised by her older
sister Francesca and rebels against her by smoking pot and not confiding in her;
and Isabel (Araya), a girl with a dark secret about her family's past she
doesn't want her friends to know, as she feels humiliated--her mother's father
and brother disappeared at the hands of the dictator's military and her mother
still suffers from severe fits of depression. </P>
<P>The film focuses its story on Sam, who was born and raised in New York for eight
years, and then returns to Chile with his divorced mother. His father has no
contact with him and his mother is never home, always on business in the States.
He has been cared for ever since he was 8-years-old by his sexy 17-year-old
nanny, Ema (Tamara Acosta), who sexually abused him ever since she was hired. </P>
<P>The film opens as Sam drives his friends in his mom's new Mercedes to an
abandoned luxury house he discovered, as he also brings a sofa from his house
for the teens to use. They anxiously record their experiences on a camcorder, as
they act like real teens--which means the boys are especially obnoxious and talk
in a hip-hop lingo, and all of them seem to be deeply affected by their
dysfunctional family life. Their featured video is a gross take off on some of
those teenager slasher movies, which they call "Do What Your Daddy Tells You."</P>
<P>They couple off, with Sam and Daniela trying to discover the love they have for
each other. The main action revolves around Daniela discovering that Sam is
screwing his unstable nanny who unrealistically wants to marry him, and how the
friends pull together to get rid of the nanny by contacting his mother. </P>
<P>It's a familiar theme about teenage alienation, as the story suffers at times
from being strained. Also, there are raw emotional scenes that are difficult to
watch when they are extended for too long. But what prevents this one from just
being a cliché teenager film, is that they are presented as genuine teens even
if they are not that appealing and the story might not be compelling to
everyone--especially those who watch such loud kids in public places and are
turned off by them (I guess that would include me in that category). </P>
<P>The film is political in nature and it should be best understood by the teens
now living in Chile who are familiar with the social climate in their home turf.</P>
<P>The teens grapple with their frustrations and loneliness, and mature somewhat by
the film's end. This seemed to be what the audience was rooting for to happen,
as they were obnoxious but not bad sorts. </P>
