<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>André Techiné (Wild Reeds/Ma Saison Préférée) has come up with another
of his art-house films, guaranteed to dazzle the senses, featuring
Caroline Champetier's beautiful camera work of the colorful meadows of
southern France, a stupendously gorgeous and magical shot of a troubled
child opening up the shutters in his room to a dark sky of bubbly
snowflakes, and of the steel blue skies of Paris setting a sober
background mood for those  busy jump-starting their struggling careers
in the bustling city.</P>
<P>This dysfunctional family tale, is told mainly through the eyes of an
emotionally disturbed bastard son, Martin (Loret). He is first seen
after growing up for his first 10 years with his earthy, beautician
mother, Jeanine (Carmen Maura) and then brought to live with his real,
well-off, philandering industrialist father, Victor (Maguelon), his
stolid wife (Marthe Villalonga), and his three half-brothers. He hates
living with his father since he believes his father doesn't want him.</P>
<P>The film will uncover the secrets in his life that causes him to have a
nervous breakdown. It will show the relationship he has with his family
and with his lover, Alice (Binoche), and how tortured with self-hatred
he becomes trying to judge himself and find his soul, tormented about a
guilt that is gnawing at him after his father dies and he runs away from
home.</P>
<P>Love and guilt become the two obstacles in the young man's troubled
life, and the answers he seeks are imponderable but the reasons for his
breakdown seem on the surface like they are out of a Freudian psychology
101 college course. The director is ultimately asking the viewer to be
the judge, as he seems too preoccupied with painting his canvas with a
love that gets stuck somewhere between a lustful sexual romp and one of
pathos. What results in an incomplete ending for a film that can't stand
clarity except in its photography and its affection for the three flawed
main characters (Alice, Martin, and Benjamin). The story seemed jarring
at times, its inexorable rhythms and its lack of dialogue seemed out of
place with the attempt made in tracking each character down in depth.
Yet the film seems to work best when it was in a state of murkiness.
When things started clearing up and the characters become who we think
they were, the big secret doesn't seem that surprising, but how it is
handled seems bizarre though not fully credible, as it is perplexing why
the main character is so concerned with finding out something about
himself that will cause him so much pain when he doesn't have to. Yet
there is something about this film that is more than meets the eye, even
though the film left me unsatisfied, it was still so well-crafted, that
I found myself liking it better than I first thought I did.</P>
<P>The film does not necessarily go in chronological order, thereby the
flashbacks that come without order, are meant to give weight to the
story as presented at the time, and will give this rather conventional
unhappy family story line a feeling of much more mystery than is needed.
The film does succeed in exposing the wounds of jealousy, obsessive
love, and atavistic demands. But it's too melodramatic, the guilt
motivation seems too illogical, and the half-baked psychology fails to
explain its characters for it too fully work as drama. The actors were
all sweating their lines to make it seem as if they had to dig deep to
come up with a gem here and there, but their performances were all
finely tuned and seemed to add to the film's need to have confusion be
its guiding light. What keeps this film going, is the way it keeps the
emotional pot boiling, and just when you are ready to give up on it as
merely sitcom stuff, the film bounces back from its wordless silence and
halting love dramatics to boil over with fits of liberating agony.</P>
<P>The film kicks into high gear when the grown Martin runs out of the
prison-like gates of his tyrannical father's house, as he just pushed
him down the stairs accidently killing him. He then lives for three
weeks on the run as a fugitive in the countryside, where he watches a
dead deer carcass being devoured by carrion, tries unsuccessfully to
drown himself, and gets caught by a farmer stealing his eggs from a
chicken coop, as his father's wife pays his fine to release him from
prison. There was no dialogue to explain why he's a fugitive or what's
on his mind. Martin then heads to the Paris apartment of his homosexual
half-brother Benjamin (Amalric) and his tense violinist roomate Alice.
Here, he becomes inarticulate, still with the wild look of someone who
is being hunted down.</P>
<P>The pretty-boy Martin becomes sexually obsessed with the neurotic Alice,
he even gets caught stalking her, but she sticks to her safe Platonic
relationship with the aspiring actor Benjamin, who is currently
supporting himself by being a store security guard, even though she is
tempted by him sexually, nothing romantically transpires-though she is
flattered by the attention. But when he moves out and becomes a
well-established male model in the fashion world, with pictures of him
on advertising posters all over Paris, things begin to change. He then
gives her the ultimatum that he wants her or else he won't see her
again. She turns down this proposal, but with a look more of sadness
than of love, she goes to him and says, "Take me, I'm yours if you want
me." Martin takes her to bed and the inexperienced lover makes up for
lost time as a virgin.</P>
<P>The trouble they soon experience comes twofold, Benjamin goes into a
jealous snit that he lost what is his and, secondly, when she tells
Martin that he's going to be a daddy, he goes into a coma and when he
comes out of that, the boy checks himself into an asylum, where the
drums beating in his head are what drive men crazy. It seems that the
possibility of him being a father triggered off memories of the guilt he
is living with and can't cope with. Alice decides she loves the guy and
will stand-by him no matter what, and in order to understand him, she
returns to see his two mothers, and tries to find out what is bothering
her man.</P>
<P>You have to stick with this one and not get too perturbed by the
unsatisfying finale to see this one through and then, you might feel its
emotional grip growing on you. It's a pure cinematic vehicle, where the
pictures tell the story better than the story seems to be told. There
was a strangely felt wry humor that underscored the dead serious mood
the film had. Alexis Loret, in his debut film role, gives an interesting
performance of someone who is always out of place no matter where he is.
But, when it comes to the heavy romance, I didn't feel that this romance
was as deep as portrayed. Though the director might have implied it had
more going for it than sexual gratification, I saw no other convincing
reason for the romance. It could be asserted that maternal instincts,
soul searching, and misplaced pathos on Juliette's part were responsible
for the romance, but I couldn't see any other reason but the libido.
Martin was just not a warm enough character to believe he could generate
so much unconditional love.</P>
