<PRE>ARMAGEDDON *1/2 (out of four)
-a review by Bill Chambers

<P>New address. Same old attitude. Don't forget to recommend a film,
read the journal, or send me some of that nasty HATE MAIL.)</P>
<PRE>                     starring Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv
Tyler, Ben Affleck
                            written by Jonathan Hensleigh and J.J.
Abrams
                                      directed by Michael Bay</PRE>
<P>It rocks-actually, lots of rocks fly at us or from us, in slow or fast
motion, at several points in the film. They seem
like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead
of just propelling forward, and when they
land-once in a while, when we need a break from the space sequences-they
cause damage enough to destroy the
Chrysler building and the like. (Nary a mention of these apocalyptic
events is made after they occur.) They also just
might be the most interesting element of ARMAGEDDON, a steroid user's
answer to Deep Impact.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis stars as Harry Stamper, a famed oil-driller commissioned by
the White House and NASA to stop a
giant asteroid before it travels beyond "zero barrier" and destroys our
planet. Why an oil driller? They require
someone experienced with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile
into said asteroid. (In one unintentionally (?)
hilarious sequence, NASA asks Harry to inspect a deep-core driller they
built based on his own blueprints; it is poorly
constructed-Harry criticizes almost every aspect of it. We trust NASA to
build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids?) Harry
assembles the obligatory "ragtag" bunch of "cowboys", including a blond
guy, a fat guy, a black guy, a wiseass, and the man who is sleeping with
his daughter (Affleck). Once they reach space, we experience sequence
after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent
a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to
do with it; I cannot count the number of times they almost fail the
mission on all my fingers and toes. Whether or not
they save the day, I will not reveal. Nor will you care.</P>
<P>I will say this: you know you're in trouble when Deep Impact dwarfs your
asteroid movie in terms of emotion and
scope. Willis has barely a chance to come alive; ditto for Affleck.
Their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third
act, in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the
material. Steve Buscemi's character-the
wiseass-is exceptionally problematic. "Rockhound", as he's called, is
sarcastic and foolish, so they tape him to a
chair, where he spends most of the film. So why did they bring him up
there to begin with? Rather, why write him
into the film?-give his almost-witty one-liners to serious Willis, who
scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic
tendencies: at one point he chases after Affleck with his shotgun for
screwing his daughter, firing often and causing
significant damage to his oil rig. I'm guessing he qualifies under NASA
guidelines as someone unfit for space travel,
at least in my world where the sky is blue. Liv Tyler is pretty and
humourless, as always; suspiciously, four of her
father's band's ("Aerosmith") songs grace the soundtrack. Director
Michael Bay lays the visual and sound effects
on thick, like ketchup, eventually drowning the movie on-screen. (The
middle hour is a non-sensical, pyrotechnic
assault on the average primate's brain.) Whenever someone dies in this
movie, a crew member inevitably yells out
"We lost (insert dead person's last name here)!" I must admit that not
once could I distinguish a dead
oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one, and close-ups of the corpses'
faces beneath cracked helmets provided little
assistance, as their skin was often covered in fake blood.</P>
<P>ARMAGEDDON is not as terrible movie as Godzilla. It looks nicer, and has
fewer plot-holes within its equally
ludicrous framework. It has a vivid soundmix. But at almost
two-and-a-half hours, I could not believe how little
actually happened over the course of the story. The love story has been
played up in the ads, perhaps hoping to
catch people before they recover from Titanic-fever. Bollocks! The
lovers in the film are miles apart
throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace
them with obligatory shots of Liv Tyler
tearing up while Ben Affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler.</P>
<P>Remember a little film called Jaws? In this film, three
independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a
fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark. They didn't much like each
other at first; eventually, they started to
respect one another. One of Jaws' great scenes involved the
would-be-Ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling
stories. This is the sort of male-bonding foreign to Bay or his
producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, who throw too many
characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds
that the world is about to end. Not once do
we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-I'd be
surprised if these actors bothered to
introduce themselves to one another before "action" was called. A male
friend who loved the film suggested to me
that perhaps I cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their
souls, who believe in dying macho concepts like
heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery. To this, I will respond
that the boys in ARMAGEDDON are neither
heroic, nor brave, nor smart, even: this team couldn't build a
birdhouse. And if I get no respect for disliking a movie
with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie
written by a team of body-builders and greeting card
authors-I've never been a prouder wimp my whole life.</P>
