(Alonzo), Norman Kerry (Malabar, Circus Strongman), John George (Cojo), Nick de

<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>One of the great silent films of all time. It was also one of the most offbeat
psychological dramas ever produced by a major studio, especially one such as
MGM. The collaboration between director/writer Tod Browning, himself a one time
circus performer, and the intense performance by Lon Chaney, was a thing of
magic. </P>
<P>Alonzo (Lon Chaney) is an armless knife-thrower in a gypsy circus, known as
"Alonzo,   The Armless Wonder." He's really not armless, but has his arms
strapped to his sides to appear limbless since he wishes to hide his identity
from the cops. He's a career criminal on the run, who with his cohort Cojo (John
George), continues to commit robberies while touring with the circus. Cojo is
the only one who knows his secret and is the only friend he has. Alonzo is able
to fling the knives with the toes of his feet, and his assistant Nano (Joan
Crawford) is the target. She's the beautiful daughter of the circus owner and
ringmaster, Zanzi (Nick de Ruiz). </P>
<P>Alonzo has become obsessed with Nano, and would do anything in the world for her
love. He would also, he tells Cojo, do anything he could to someone who takes
her away from him. Nano has a bit of a psychological problem, she can't stand
any man who puts their arms around her or who tries to touch her. She feels very
safe with Alonzo and they develop an affectionate bond of friendship, where she
feels good hugging him. The circus strongman Malabar (Kerry) also compulsively
loves her and won't take no for an answer, but he keeps putting his arms around
her as she pushes him away. </P>
<P>Zanzi doesn't trust Alonzo and when he sees his daughter alone with him again,
his anger builds because he feels he is putting "ideas" in his daughter's head.
In a fit of rage he beats Alonzo with a whip until Malabar puts a stop to it and
receives the thanks of Alonzo. But one evening Zanzi again confronts Alonzo,
this time in the dark shadows nearby Nanon's wagon and he notices that Alonzo
has arms. This causes Alonzo to strangle him to death, but Nano could only see
that the strangler had two thumbs on one hand. </P>
<P>Realizing that he can't marry her if he has arms, he decides to have them cut
off. He blackmails a doctor (Lanning) into doing the procedure. But when he
returns to see Nano, she tells him that she overcame her fear of having a man
put her arms around her and will marry Malabar. </P>
<P>The film builds to its bizarre ending as Alonzo plans to tear off the
strongman's arms during his act, where the horse runs on a treadmill and he
holds back the horse's reins with the strength of both arms. This was a
vengeful, gruesome and scary scene. </P>
<P>"The Unknown" is a tightly made film, with a sinister plot and a startling and
intense performance by Chaney. The film presents an excellent study of
character, though its theme is morbid and boiling with hatred it is still
appealing because of its edginess. "The Unknown" did well in the box-office, as
Chaney was a top Hollywood star at the time. It was the last of the great silent
films, as just 4 months later the first talkie opened: "The Jazz Singer." </P>
