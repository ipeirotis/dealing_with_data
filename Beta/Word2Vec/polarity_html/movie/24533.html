<P>     I'm not saying that there's absolutely nothing Julie Taymor isn't
willing to try in her feature film debut TITUS, but at some point during
the production I'm fairly certain I saw a kitchen sink fly through the
frame. It came somewhere between the Roman soldiers marching in
traditional costume and political rivals riding in motorcades, between the
swing band playing at an emperor's wedding feast and the swing of a camera
around a freeze-frame tableau of death a la THE MATRIX. There's no telling
from one minute to the next where or when we are, or what cinematic device
will make a cameo appearance. Virtually from the first frame, TITUS
unfolds as over two and a half hours of blood, bombast and auteurial
audacity.</P>
<P>     I'm having a hard time putting my finger on exactly why TITUS
actually left me marginally impressed instead of bored by the director's
"hey, check out what I can do" style. Sure, it's Shakespeare; it's also
the play T. S. Eliot called "one of the stupidest and most uninspired
plays ever written." The main narrative follows the tragedies that befall
a successful Roman general named Titus Andronicus (Anthony Hopkins) after
his return from a campaign against the Goths. Though the people want Titus
to become emperor after the death of the latest Caesar, the warrior
instead supports the late emperor's eldest son Saturninus (Alan Cumming). 
Big mistake. Soon Saturninus is married to Tamora (Jessica Lange), a Goth
queen with a grudge against Titus, and Titus' family begins meeting with
cruel fates -- many of them orchestrated by Tamora's Moorish lover Aaron
(Harry Lennix).</P>
<P>     TITUS' odd prologue finds a young boy (Osheen Jones) in a
contemporary kitchen playing violently with his toys before being spirited
away to the locations of the play. Initially, I suspected that Taymor was
preparing to put together an attack on the glorification and sanitization
of violence, with the boy as silent observer to the story's many murders,
sacrifices, dismemberments and throat-slashings. Indeed, the acts of
violence and vengeance are many and frequent, but the sub-text of the boy
as observer eventually vanishes as he is abruptly absorbed into the
narrative as Titus' grandson. Without a sense that there's some sort of
cultural lesson to be taken away from the gruesome events, they simply
become gruesome events. I'd never read TITUS ANDRONICUS nor seen any
production before this one, and I can't say I'm terribly eager to see it
again. T. S. Eliot wasn't being very hyperbolic in his assessment.</P>
<P>     Yet while TITUS is far from a gripping story, it's still a pretty
decent piece of theater. Taymor's roots are on Broadway (she directed the
stage production of THE LION KING), but that doesn't mean she can't make
use of a camera. At times, TITUS almost seems to be the work of a director
who isn't sure if she'll ever get the chance to make a film again, so she
leaves everything she's got on the screen. There are a couple of shots
that ended up lodged in my head -- a horrifying vision of Titus' daughter
Lavinia (Laura Fraser) discovered by Titus' brother Marcus (Colm Feore) 
after she has been raped and mutilated, and a truck carrying some grisly
artifacts of the Andronici's conflict with the emperor. Dante Ferretti's
production design and Elliot Goldenthal's score must have driven each man
mad, so many variations does Taymor ask of them. It's hard to imagine so
grim a tale given more energy through sheer force of a director's
imagination.</P>
<P>     It would be a cruel misuse of the word "entertaining" to say that
TITUS qualifies. It's well-acted enough -- Cumming in particular is a
delight as the foppish Saturninus -- but not a showcase for master
thespianism. In fact, Anthony Hopkins' best moment may be a ghoulish
reference to his renown as cinema's most famous cannibal. I didn't enjoy
all that much of TITUS, but I found myself admiring Taymor's choices even
when I didn't understand them, or even agree with them. Simply put, TITUS
is a display of film-making nerve -- the spectacle of a novice movie
director deciding to pick Shakespeare for her first work, and one of
Shakespeare's least respected works at that, then molding it into
something consistently watchable. Taymor gets her hands dirty the hard way
... and, fortunately for her, there's a kitchen sink lying around to wash
them in.</P>
