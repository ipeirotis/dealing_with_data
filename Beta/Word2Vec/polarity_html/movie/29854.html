<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Another obvious crime film with black and white partner cops. This one is set in
modern LA and filled with pointless violence, and with nothing relevant to say
about its dirty cop subject matter. It would have been just another entertaining
film that was eye-catching, amusing, and filled with non-stop action but for the
last fifteen minutes, when the film fell apart and came up with a very unsound
ending and ruined any chance for it to be appreciated in an artistic sense--even
for Denzel Washington's fine performance. The way it ended made no sense, as
this smorgasbord in violence had gangs of blacks, Mexicans, and even Russians,
interact with corrupt city law enforcers. The filmmaker chooses the craziest and
most unbelievable way for the dirty cop to get his comeuppance. </P>
<P>The white cop is an ambitious rookie on the force only 19 months, Jake Hoyt
(Ethan Hawke), who dreams of being a detective. He doesn't want to blow his
chances on his training day to get permanently assigned to an elite undercover
narc unit that busts the big-time drug dealers and will give him a chance to be
the good guy collaring the bad drug dealers, so he kisses up to his superior.
The job promises action and many arrests, things the young athletic cop
relishes. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) is the leader of five other police
officers, and he will determine if Jake is trustworthy after this one day of
training. </P>
<P>Denzel has the role of the dirty cop who has all the smart answers for why he's
so set on his vigilante ways. In his bogus philosophy, he tells Jake "It takes a
wolf to catch a wolf."  He goes on to say that in this business "You've got to
decide, Are you a wolf or a sheep." He's the mentor of the innocent,
incorruptible, straight-laced cop, who wants to save his city from drug dealers
and bring home an honest paycheck to pay for a suburban lifestyle for his wife
and kid. Denzel gives an over the top performance, taking his slimy character
down a rotten path of greed, corruption, and murder. For Denzel, this is a
chance for him to show off how he could be cast against type as the heavy and
still be charismatic. If anything, this pic shows that he's up to being a
baddie. He's dressed for the part wearing a gang-style black leather jacket and
having draped around his neck enough jewelry, including a diamond crucifix, to
please any hip-hop enthusiast. He's also up to the physical nature of the role
as he gives a muscular performance, and he is able to talk the street-talk with
the best of them. </P>
<P>To start their training unorthodox day, there is no police roll call to answer
to as Alonzo meets him in a coffee shop. It becomes apparent that Alonzo doesn't
follow the book, as he plays mind games with Jake and plants the seeds that you
either do things my way or it's back to hum-drum police work with no promotions
in sight. Jake is too tempted by the action to leave but, when he watches Alonzo
steal drugs that some college kids just bought from a snitch dealer, he begins
to have second thoughts. The slick Alonzo, using his vintage souped-up black
Monte Carlo as an office - forcefully induces the trainee to smoke pot laced
with PCP by threatening to not accept him into his unit if he doesn't and by
taunting him into believing that if he doesn't know what pot tastes like how
could he be a narc. That would endanger his life in the street. "Training Day"
has now tainted its hero and made its statement of what it thinks of undercover
work, and now the kid must fight his ambitions and see if he can remain
steadfast in what he believes. </P>
<P>The action-packed day continues with a social call to a jaded top drug dealer
who was a former colleague of Alonzo', Roger (Scott Glenn), who wishfully talks
about retiring to an island as the drugged-out Jake tries to tune into what's
going on; there's a visit to a bad black ghetto that the thugs run, where Alonzo
has underhanded deals with the gang leaders who secretly hate him because he's
abusive. He lives here with his secret family--a sexy ho from El Salvador (Eva
Mendes). They also encounter an attempted street rape on a young Mexican girl
that Alonzo wishes to ignore but Jake can't--which leads to Alonzo working the
two attackers over instead of arresting them; there's a funny scene of the cops
searching a drug house after faking a warrant in order to steal the drug money;
there's a restaurant business meeting with corrupt city officials, and all the
while Jake is being bullied and forced to react in shock and dismay at what he
sees going on. It was just too much slime to take in for one day, as somewhere
after the first half of the film the shock scenes simply wore off and the film
lost any dramatic effect; it just looked cartoonish. By the time Jake is asked
to cover-up a murder, the film has lost itself in its excesses. </P>
<P>But the twists in plot kept coming, and it took us down a seedier and more
improbable path. It seemed likely that Jake would have gotten off this crooked
job offer faster, if this film had wanted to achieve anything resembling
reality. The aim was obviously not realism, but to take the story into its own
interpretation of the corruption in the LAPD which was recently in the news.
This it does do successfully, showing all kinds of widespread violence and
corruption, including black-on-black crime, police frames, and the ugliness on
the streets. But the film's major failure is to go anywhere with this material
and say anything that was revealing. All the shootouts seemed glossy but the
final one seemed totally out of place, of the Russian Mafia going into action.
They looked like they belonged in a James Bond film and wandered accidently onto
the set. It left the film to be hung out to dry as just another forgettable
exploitation film, even though it was well-acted. </P>
