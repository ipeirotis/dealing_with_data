<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The simple message this one-note film envisions, is that one should
never be who they are not. To show how ridiculous the Fundamentalist
Christian family value adherents have gone in trying to force their
beliefs down everyone's throats, the film shows what they advocate can
be cruel to those who are caught in their moral trips. The debut feature
of Jamie Babbit is unabashedly awkward and to make matters worse, she
can't get the cast to stop mugging for the camera. The comedy was lame,
the characters were not interesting, only the idea was good if it could
have been developed into a story with more dimensions than the one it
belabored. The stupidity of trying to force someone against their will
from being a homosexual, is treated as a heavy-handed 'Saturday Night
Live' satire routine. There was not enough of a story for it to be
released as a movie. It was painful to watch this kind of kitsch for 80
or so minutes, which seemed to drag on for a hellish eternity. It is
just as tortorous watching this film as it probably is going through
such an indoctrination program.</P>
<P>A typical high school cheerleader in a suburban setting, the sweet,
innocent Megan (Natasha Lyonne), is driven home by her handsome high
school football player boyfriend Jared (Brandt Willie) to find her
family and friends gathered in the living room. They talk her into going
to a rehabilitation camp for homosexuals aptly named True Directions by
presenting her with the evidence of her lesbianism - her vegetarianism,
her Melissa  Etheridge poster, and her lack of responsiveness to her
boyfriend's tongue kisses (while  kissing him, she is looking longingly
over at the cheerleaders). Megan, who just wants to be normal, is
trapped by her self-righteous parents (Mink Stole & Bud Cort), the
dullness of the people in her suburban community, and with the
community's biblically defined gender roles offering no room for another
viewpoint.</P>
<P>The camp offers a 5-step program to rid one of homosexuality. The camp
director, Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty), is the rigid martinet who is a
walking cliché. Eddie Cibrian as Rock, is Mary's overtly queer son whom
she pretends is normal, used as a demonstrator for sexual correctness
exercises in the program. He is also the groundskeeper making sexual
gestures with his chain-saw, who camps it up to the point of going
over-the-top, losing all proportion for his character as being anything
but a cartoon figure. RuPaul Charles is the ex-gay counselor, whose job
is to straighten out the men ... his exaggerated gait and suppresed gay
tendencies never materialized as funny stuff, just a bad script he was
stuck with which was made more unbearable by his obnoxious performance.
All the boys in the camp were sorry sights, offering neither comedy nor
concern for them. While the girls were all forgettable types, except for
the one rebel who Megan will fall for, Graham (Clea DuVall). Clea is the
only one in the film who belonged in this film and made the most of her
role, making it believable as the rich bitchy girl who knows damn well
that she's a lesbo, but also knows that if she doesn't go through with
this farce of a rehab program, her parents will take away the trust fund
she stands to inherit.</P>
<P>The absurdity of the film is highlighted in its loud set designs, as the
girls are overwhelmed with garish pink and tangerine colored outfits and
room furnishings, while the boys are  furnished with this hideous bright
blue color. The other absurdity is in how artificial the planned steps
are and how meaningless it is to graduate from a program such as this
one. Of course, Megan, who wasn't gay to begin with, realizes that maybe
she could be gay as a result of this treatment.</P>
<P>This is not a good campy film, and to the bargain, after trying to get
laughs for the first half of the film, it then starts to take itself
seriously. But the theme is so absurd, that there really is no message
that can be delivered. Everything about it is strained. Natasha Lyonne
was miscast, she couldn't pull off what was required of the role, to be
someone who awakens in a subtle way to who she really is. She seemed to
be going for the hammy sweetness she thought her role required and when
the comedy part of the film was over and she had hot pants for Graham,
there was no spark on the screen to give the affair any life. It all
seemed manufactured, leaving the film telling its joke to an audience
they believe will be sympathetic. The problem with that is, the one-note
joke ran dry a long time ago.</P>
<P>I just couldn't wait for the film to end. If you are going to make a
campy B movie, then it takes more than crudeness and over-the-top
performances to make it funny. I'll take my campy film with no pretenses
to art ... let it be a film that is bitingly hilarious (OK, just funny
will do).</P>
