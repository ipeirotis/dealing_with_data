<P>     It's DUMB AND DUMBER meets LETHAL WEAPON sans Mel Gibson.  Can any 
premise be more doomed from the start?  Actually, the saddest thing 
about this unfunny, misguided motion picture is watching two performers 
I admire -- Joe Pesci and Danny Glover -- stumble their way through such 
obviously inferior material.  I suppose it's worth remembering that 
Glover and Pesci meshed well in two LETHAL WEAPON movies, albeit 
primarily because the characters were cleverly written.  Here, although 
the two actors display a certain "buddy" chemistry, that's a fragile 
thing to build a movie on.   </P>
<P>     As the title implies, GONE FISHIN' is about two men who go fishing.  
They're Gus (Glover) and Joe (Pesci), a couple of North Jersey guys who 
win a contest to spend a November week angling in the Florida 
Everglades.  So, hitching their rowboat to the back of Joe's '68 
Plymouth Barracuda, they head south.  Things start to go awry somewhere 
in the Carolinas when a slick con man, Dekker Massey (Nick Brimble), 
makes off with Joe's car, leaving the two men stranded.  Fortunately, 
they get a lift from Rita and Angie (Rosanna Arquette and Lynn 
Whitfield), a couple of women who are passing through on their way to 
Florida.  It turns out that Rita's mother was one of Dekker's many 
victims, and the daughter is out to recover the money he stole.  Poor 
Gus and Joe become embroiled in a situation involving guns, stolen 
jewels, and a treasure map when all they really want to do is find a 
secluded spot and cast their lines. </P>
<P>     I can't help thinking that if this movie had allowed us to spend 
ninety minutes with Gus and Joe sitting in a rowboat, catching fish, and 
talking, it would have been infinitely better than what's on screen.  
Even Pesci, a decent comic actor, can't cull humor from mirthless 
material.  For the most part, GONE FISHIN' seems uncertain how to get 
laughs.  Its PG rating robs it of the opportunity to use the kind of 
flatulence jokes that turned DUMB AND DUMBER into a hit, so it settles 
for making Gus and Joe act like little kids.  That approach is a 
failure, but no one, not director Christopher Cain nor screenwriters 
Jill Mazursky Cody and Jeffrey Abrams, seems to recognize this.   </P>
<P>     With so few comic bits that actually succeed, GONE FISHIN' quickly 
turns into a dull and meandering affair, drifting from one cliche to the 
next.  All of the expected staples are present:  runaway boats, high-
speed chases, predictable one-liners, and a bunch of equally trite 
contrivances.  All the while, we're looking for a single bright spot -- 
one solitary thing to make us chuckle so that the $4.50 matinee price 
doesn't seem like a complete waste of money. </P>
<P>     If you look hard enough, you'll find it.  One sequence with a 
sleazy boat salesman is well-written, nicely acted, and ably directed.  
It's funny, and, surprisingly enough, reasonably smart.  It also only 
lasts about three minutes, and, after that, GONE FISHIN' plunges back 
into the murky depths from which it briefly emerged.  By the time we get 
to the animatronic alligators, it's all-too-easy to forget that this 
movie contained a worthwhile moment or two.  When it comes to GONE 
FISHIN', it's best to stay home. </P>
