<P>     Depending upon one's point of view, THE WINSLOW BOY is either as
unlikely a piece of material as one could expect from David Mamet or a
perfect fit in the Mamet oeuvre.  Certainly it's surprising to find Mamet
directing a script by another writer, even more surprising to find the
ultra-contemporary Mamet directing a period piece, and more surprising yet
to find the profanity-happy Mamet directing a G-rated script.  There's
also something perfectly Mamet-like in the film's themes of people seeking
the truth of things behind the formalized dance of conversation.  Mamet
isn't straying far from comfortable ground, but he strays far enough to
find an intriguing new perspective on film-making.  THE WINSLOW BOY may be
his finest work as a film director, perhaps because he's working from a
less tightly-controlled script.</P>
<P>     The story, set in the early 1910's, concerns an upper-middle class
English family called the Winslows.  Father Arthur (Nigel Hawthorne), a
banker, is comfortable with the life he has made, and even with the lives
of his underachieving son Dicky (Matthew Pidgeon) and Suffragette daughter
Catherine (Rebecca Pidgeon).  He is not at all comfortable, however, with
youngest son Ronny's (Guy Edwards) dismissal from military school when he
is accused of stealing a five-shilling postal order.  Determined to clear
his son's name, Arthur throws all his resources into Ronny's defense,
including retaining famed lawyer Sir Robert Morton (Jeremy Northam).  But
the Winslows face an uphill battle trying to obtain a civil trial before
either their money or Sir Robert's political connections run out.</P>
<P>     A contemporary movie-goer might expect THE WINSLOW BOY to turn into a
courtroom drama, chock full of witness stand backpedaling and banging
gavels.  In fact, there's not a second of courtroom footage in THE WINSLOW
BOY; the closest it gets is Morton's tense interview with Ronnie before
deciding to take the case.  Rattigan's text is more concerned with subtler
matters than the melodrama of legal confrontations, including issues still
resonant fifty years after the play's debut.  As the Winslows' resources
dwindle, Arthur begins to wonder whether he can afford to pursue the case
indefinitely, inspiring questions on the modern connection between wealth
and justice.  The story also attacks the casual dismissal of pursuits of
justice, not on the basis of right or wrong, but on the basis of how
annoying it is to have normalcy disrupted.</P>
<P>     As thought-provoking as THE WINSLOW BOY may be, however, it's often 
far too sedate in its interpersonal relationships.  Rattigan's narrative
generally focuses not on the people involved in the Winslow case, but on
all the business surrounding the case: the intense press scrutiny 
(including a "women's issues" reporter more interested in curtains than
Ronnie's guilt or innocence); the vagaries of public opinion; the
machinations required even to bring a case against the Admiralty.  The
characters in THE WINSLOW BOY face consequences for their choices, but the
choices are more interesting to Rattigan than those consequences.  There's
a Merchant Ivory vibe to the repressed emotions without the Merchant Ivory
readiness to show the intensity behind them.</P>
<P>     Mamet has never been known for his emotionalism, but the fault here
appears to lie far more with Rattigan.  Indeed, Mamet takes some of the
simplest scenes and charges them with more feeling than they might deserve
(notably Arthur's demand of honesty from Ronnie).  He has always been a
remarkably efficient film director, and THE WINSLOW BOY certainly doesn't
stray in that regard.  He does, however, find a facility with actors not 
always evident when he's working from his own words.  Hawthorne is
brilliant, Northam is appropriately enigmatic, and even Rebecca Pidgeon
seems vaguely human.  There's little Mamet can do with the huge chunks of
dialogue involving exposition of off-stage events, or to fill in the
spaces between the people, but he does a lot with a story that's more
conceptual than actual.  THE WINSLOW BOY is an interesting challenge to
which Mamet rises, applying his intricate construction as well to a
stately manor as he does to a skyscraper.</P>
