<P>     Potential viewers who may be scared away from BOOGIE NIGHTS by its
subject matter, take note:  you're not likely to find a more potent
morality tale anywhere this year.  The milieu may be the pornography
industry of the late 1970s and early 1980s, but those with prurient
interest need not apply.  BOOGIE NIGHTS is that rare example of riveting
film-making which also instructs, so unobtrusively you almost can't tell
you're being instructed.  Never has the self-delusional narcissism of the
"Me Decade" been portrayed with such an eye to the repercussions.  This is
the story not just of an endless party, but of the harrowing morning after
the party finally does end.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson opens his narrative in 1977,
swooping through a San Fernando Valley disco as he introduces his
principle characters:  adult film director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds);
his leading lady Amber Waves (Julianne Moore); perpetually skating ingenue
Rollergirl (Heather Graham); black leading man Buck Swope (Don Cheadle)
and a 17-year-old busboy named Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg).  Horner sees
something in the young man -- not the least of which is his spectacular
male endowment -- which encourages him to bring Eddie into his film-making
family.  Re-christened Dirk Diggler, the new stud on the block becomes an
instant sensation in the industry headlining the erotic adventures of
private eye Brock Landers.</P>
<P>     And just as instantly, he gets caught up in the glitter and glory of
the 70s in Southern California.  BOOGIE NIGHTS does a spectacular job of
re-creating its era, with its Pee-Chee folders, 8-track tapes and Fresca,
but its greater triumph is making the tunnel vision of its characters both
hilarious and pathetic.  When Jack's sincere pronouncement that he longs
to make story-centered sex films clashes with our glimpses of the 
mechanical, blank-faced films he is creating, it's enough to make you
laugh out loud; when Dirk proudly shows off his "imported Italian nylon"
print shirts, it's like watching a smug dinosaur blissfully unaware of his
own impending extinction.  The characters in BOOGIE NIGHTS have no sense
that everything they do and everything they enjoy will soon be considered
utterly ridiculous -- or worse, that they will cast a shadow over the rest
of their lives.</P>
<P>     That is exactly what happens as BOOGIE NIGHTS blasts into the 80s
with a literal bang.  Anderson takes the story on a darker turn, watching
the characters discover consequences for their actions they never
anticipated.  The pace flags somewhat in the second half hour, but in a
way it had to -- after the coke-fuelled pool parties, all that remains to
show us is the inevitable, painful hangover.  It is here that the
exceptional cast truly begins to shine:  the always dazzling Julianne
Moore as a mother in search of children; a surprisingly dignified Burt
Reynolds becoming a disgusted auteur of the amateur video era; Don Cheadle
as an aspiring entrepreneur who finds his past thwarting his attempt to go
legit; and Mark Wahlberg as a cocaine addict who discovers his one true
talent vanishing with the drug's effect on his ability to "perform."
Appropriately, there isn't much about the final 45 minutes of BOOGIE
NIGHTS which could be considered "fun."  Cautionary story-telling rarely
gets this grim, electrifying and compelling.</P>
<P>     The most talked-about moment in BOOGIE NIGHTS will probably be the
final shot, in which Wahlberg finally displays the equipment
(prosthetically-enhanced, if you must know) which has been the subject of
so much discussion through the rest of the film.  It would be easy to
consider that moment gratuitious, but it would be just as inappropriate as
thinking of BOOGIE NIGHTS just as a movie about the porno business.  In
effect, the whole film is about the ultimate "dick thing," a group of
people who simply can't see the world beyond what's going on between their
legs.  Dirk's pep talk to his own genitalia undercuts the seemingly
idyllic conclusion which precedes it -- it turns out he hasn't really
learned much of anything.  Viewers, on the other hand, have a chance to
learn more than they might expect from BOOGIE NIGHTS...for instance, that
sometimes a sex film isn't just a sex film.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 boogie fevers:  9.</PRE>
