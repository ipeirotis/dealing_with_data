<PRE>                                    SPEED
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton,
           Jeff Daniels.
Screenplay:  Graham Yost.
Director:  Jan DeBont.</PRE>
<P>     Since the dawn of time, three Great Questions have defied the
greatest minds:  Is there a God?  Is there existence after death?  And
how does Keanu Reeves continue to get work as an actor?  All right,
that might be a slight exaggeration; I have some ideas about that life
after death thing.  Reeves remains a mystery, a physically striking but
mush-mouthed thespian who has been cast by Coppola, Bertolucci and
Branagh.  A post-BILL AND TED star-making vehicle has eluded him,
however--until now.  Arriving with more buzz than a swarm of killer
bees is SPEED, and you can believe the hype.  Thrilling and relentless
to a fault, SPEED seems destined to score big box office and make
Reeves a very hot property.</P>
<P>     Reeves plays Jack Traven, a risk-taking member of the L.A.P.D.'s
anti-terrorist unit.  In the film's sensational prologue, Jack and his
partner (Jeff Daniels) foil a bomber (Dennis Hopper) holding an
elevator full of people hostage.  Jack thinks the bomber is dead, but
he returns, still seeking his $3.7 million but now with a score to
settle as well.  The bomber tells Jack that a city bus has been rigged
to blow if it drops below 50 miles per hour, and that any attempt to
evacuate the passengers will also lead to the destruction of the bus.
Jack manages to get on board the bus, searching for a way to defuse the
bomb and helping the passenger (Sandra Bullock) who has taken over for
the incapacitated bus driver to keep them all alive and speeding.</P>
<P>     As high concepts go, SPEED would have been difficult to screw up
completely.  Where I had my doubts was regarding the ability to keep
things varied and interesting; there are only so many ways a bus can
crash through guardrails and other cars.  But astonishingly, SPEED
continues to come up with new and interesting predicaments just when
you think there can't be anywhere else for it to go.  Screenwriter
Graham Yost and director Jan DeBont almost give themselves too tough an
act to follow by opening with the elevator rescue, a stunningly staged
sequence that will leave you breathless before you're even out of
popcorn.  Once the action hits the road, the set pieces come fast,
furious and rarely derivative.  The location moves from crowded
freeways to open spaces, each new environment providing new
challenges.  There is even that rarity of rarities, a moment that
inspires a collective audible gasp, followed closely by relieved
laughter.  The term "edge of your seat" is thrown around a lot, but
that is exactly where I spent the majority of SPEED's two hour running
time.</P>
<P>     Still, there is the Keanu question, and the fortunate answer is
that Jack Traven is the perfect role for Reeves.  He is asked to do
little more than set his jaw and look good in a tight T-shirt, and he's
good at both.  The taciturn Traven is a switch from the Willis/
Schwarzenegger school of one-liner heroism, and something of a welcome
one at that.  With Reeves maintaining a poker face, the required
tension release falls to the supporting cast.  Sandra Bullock, so
annoying as Stallone's partner in DEMOLITION MAN, is extremely
appealing as driver/passenger Annie, managing to combine strength and
emotion in a surprisingly seamless performance.  Dennis Hopper as a
psycho killer is no stretch, but he plays it with panache, and Alan
Ruck (best known as FERRIS BUELLER's buddy Cameron) has a couple of
good moments as a tourist on the bus.  The performances are better than
one might expect from a film like SPEED, and from Keanu Reeves in
particular.</P>
<P>     If there is a fault to be found with SPEED, it's that it really
doesn't know when enough is enough.  The bus's physics defying leap
over a stretch of incomplete freeway is more comically absurd than
exciting, and almost lost me.  Once the bus-based plot is over, there's
still another fifteen minutes to go, and perhaps out of some sense of
houw an action film has to end there is a mano-a-mano between Reeves
and Hopper aboard a commuter train.  At that point, yet another set of
improbable crises becomes overkill.  And ironically, it may have
eliminated one possible plot for the sequel.  Don't be surprised if
there is one; SPEED is 1994's THE FUGITIVE, and then some.</P>
<PRE>     Summer's first thrill ride is here.  Buckle up.</PRE>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 exploding buses:  9.</PRE>
