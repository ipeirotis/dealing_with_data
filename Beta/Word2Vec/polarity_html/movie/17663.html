WHEN TRUMPETS FADE (director: John Irving; cast: Ron Eldard (Manning),
Zak Orth (Sanderson), Martin Donovan (Capt. Roy Pritchett), Dylan Bruno
(Sgt. Talbot), Dwight Yoakam (Lt. Colonel), Frank Whaley (Chamberlain),
Timothy Olyphant (Lt. Lukas), Dan Futterman (Despin), 1998)</P>
<P>This is a gritty, workman-like WW11 HBO made for TV movie, that is much
better, surprisingly, than most of those kind of movies usually are,
taking place in a battlefield in the Hurtgen Forest, 1944, on the border
of Belgium and Germany, though it was shot in Hungary. This battle was a
precursor to the Battle of the Bulge, and is not as well known, but
24,000 U.S. troops did lose their lives there in bloody combat. The film
is seen through the eyes of Pvt. Manning (Ron), whose main purpose in
battle is to stay alive. In a year when two epic war films were made,
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and THE THIN RED LINE, this low budget movie holds
its own with those films storywise, only lacking the great
cinematography of those films, but its  cinematography was realistic
enough, aiding in the clarity of telling the story, that is highlighted
by an engaging characterization by Ron Eldard and the other soldiers who
look as if they are really WW11 soldiers. Eldard's quiet toughness and
demeanor seems to fit his role as a non-conformist soldier, even though
Manning is not exactly a hero, but more of a man who is wrestling with
his conscience, thrust into a situation he didn't relish, due to
unforeseen circumstances and clever manuevering by his superior
officers, a role in which he comes through in the end with flying
colors, ironically getting killed in action, in the end, because of his
reward for previously surviving. Now this has been tried in many of the
older WW11 films, but for the most part, it didn't work because the
acting was not as convincing as these unheralded actors are.</P>
<P>We first see Manning in action trying to carry one of the badly wounded
survivors from his squad back to his company area, but is resisted by
the soldier, who is scared out of his mind. Manning is forced to shoot
him, rather than leave him behind in pain, with no chance of being
rescued. Upon his return to his company, his commander, Captain
Pritchett (Donovan), has the task of telling him he is the sole
survivor, and to his regret, even if he doesn't fully trust Manning, he,
at least, recognizes that he has an innate battle sense, which is why he
chooses to make him a sergeant; it will be his job to lead the new
replacements into the next battle, which is part of the big push toward
Germany. The heart of the movie revolves around the credibility of the
human drama involving how Manning is forced to take this responsible
position, even as he tries to talk the captain out of it, knowing full
well that he will now have to look out not only for himself but for
others, when his ability to survive before, just depended on how he
looked out for himself, which he proved that he was quite capable of
doing. In such a short time, we feel that we know Manning and know what
he will do, and that his tough mental attitude seems more realistic than
many of the other soldiers we see with a proper military attitude. It is
hard to say for sure if we can like a person such as Manning, but even
as we question his motives, whether or not they are selfish, we still
respect him as a man who will not blindly follow orders, even if he has
to be insubordinate. This fuzziness about his character holds our
interest throughout the film.</P>
<P>The replacement soldiers have no clue of what they are getting into,
having no battle experience, as they are now unfairly thrust into the
middle of some of the fiercest fighting taking place. One of the new
soldiers, Warren (Zak), is perfecto for this part. When on his first
tour in a foxhole, he asks the person he relieves of duty the most
sensible question he can ask, "What am I supposed to do here?" The logic
of that question and the inexperience of  his new sergeant in telling
him what to do on watch, and the natural snafus that are part of the
army, all come into play in the consternation written all over Warren's
chubby bespectacled, purely innocent American face, stuck in a war whose
ideology sounds good in the text books and newspapers back home, but has
a strange way of losing force in a foxhole.Warren was undoubtedly picked
on by Manning for this detail, because of his nerdy physical appearance
and his inability to hide his greenness and fear. Be that as it may,
Warren grows up rapidly and handles himself with dignity, and becomes
the sole survivor, as he becomes Manning's heir apparent.</P>
<P>There is some kind of friction between the field officers and the
regular soldiers, the ones who bear the brunt of the war and who are
asked to die for their country, if need be. Dwight Yoakam plays the Lt.
Colonel, who is acting the part of the hard-nosed, uncaring leader,
sending men into battles where there is little chance of them returning
in one piece. Thusly, he orders Capt. Pritchett to take a bridge the
Germans have heavy firepower on. Here the story gets a little
incredulous, as no squad volunteers for that detail, the captain tells
Manning he will give him a section 8 discharge if he volunteers for the
job. Manning had previously asked for that but it was denied him, but
here it sounds phony that Manning would accept, but he does, putting his
new replacements in a danger they really shouldn't have been in just for
his selfish interest. Everyone in the squad gets killed but Manning and
Warren, but the bridge is temporarily secured by the combat instincts of
Manning. A few things then happen, as this tightly drawn tale begins to
weaken into a predictable ending, as Lt. Lukas (Olyphant) has a nervous
break down after seeing all the casualties, and the Lt. Colonel orders
Manning to take his place and be a lieutenant; again, this is done
against Manning's wishes. Also, a Sgt. Talbot (Bruno), who resents
Manning's unwillingness to be a team player, accuses him of abandoning
his green troops and coming back again without a full squad.</P>
<P>Each of the recent war films I have seen has its own grit and dirt to
it, as they seemed to be made nowadays with a new determination to be
more realistic and less all apple pie than ever before, as most of the
pre-Vietnam War films were. I welcome this kind of realistic filmmaking,
and since war never seems to go out of style, it is worthwhile seeing
how young men fight in such wars, maybe some day all sides will figure
out that there is a better way to settle things. Until then, there is
nothing like a good war film to bring the war into our homes and
consciousness, and this one is a reasonably good one.</P>
