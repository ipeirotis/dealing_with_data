<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>David Lynch's Lost Highway, his first feature film after five years, is
a surreal thriller with a puzzling plot, that asks a lot from the
viewer, as far as accepting this far-fetched tale on face value. It's
meant to be a non-conventional film, a shocker, an attempt at
post-modern noir, an avant-garde sci-fi ghost story that is stylish and
engrossing, but what it mostly is, is a confusing film that tries to be
weirder than his Eraserhead and Blue Velvet films, but is too outlandish
to be compared with those superior features. It also smacks of being
pretentious, of putting down the characters in nonhuman terms, as if
they are so unimportant that they can easily be reincarnated to appear
as someone else, without any explanation being given. It was a cold
story, seemingly with psychological undertones about
multiple-personality disorders that stretches logic to the breaking
point. But it held my attention throughout and concludes with a
roller-coast ride down a dark, desolate highway, with an ending that
does little to give meaning to the puzzle. But it does complete its
narrative by tieing up the loose ends of what the characters were
plotting and it keeps intact its pessimistic mood.</P>
<P>Fred Madison (Pullman) is a jazz saxophone player living in an
ultra-modern posh house in the Hollywood Hills section of L.A., who is
distraught because he suspects his sexy brunette wife Renee (Patricia
Arquette) of cheating. A videocassette is left on their doorstep showing
that their house is being observed. The next day another tape is found
on the doorstep, it reveals the couple sleeping in their bedroom, which
prompts them to call the cops to investigate. Fred, also, at this time,
suffers from a series of nightmares in which he sees a mysterious,
pasty-faced man (Blake). Coincidentally, at a party given by Andy, a
friend of his wife's, he sees the same mystery man he saw in his dream.
Strangely, this mystery man knows he was in Fred's dream. A third
videocassette arrives, this one shows the results of a grisly murder, as
Renee is bludgeoned to death and Fred, the presumably innocent victim
has no memory of her slaying and doesn't believe he did it, yet is
nevertheless convicted of first degree murder. And before you realize
what's happening, Fred is in an isolated cell on Death Row awaiting to
be juiced to death.</P>
<P>While in his cell, Fred unexplainably changes into a younger man, a
garage mechanic named Pete (Balthazar Getty). Pete winds up in Fred's
cell with a gash on his puss. Fred just vanishes for the time being. The
captain of the prison exclaims, when he sees what happened, "This is
some spooky shit we got here." It sounded like this is something that
could have been said in an adult version of an 'Amos and Andy' sketch.</P>
<P>Pete when released from prison goes home to his supportive parents and
punky girlfriend Sheila, and returns to his auto mechanic job. Mr. Eddy
(Loggia), a ruthless gangster, admires the way Pete fixes his cars. On
one of those car visits, he is accompanied by someone who could be Renee
(still Arquette) but with blonde hair and who now goes by the name
Alice. She is his mistress, and he is quite willing to kill anyone who
makes a play for her.</P>
<P>Alice entices Pete to begin this dangerous affair with her, and when she
fears Mr.Eddy is getting wise to them, she talks him into doing a
robbery in the desert and running away with her.</P>
<P>Lynch then goes into exploiting his usual themes of violence, gore and
dubious sexual situations and we also get to see Arquette stroll around
in her underwear, when she's not completely nude. She was the least
interesting of all the characters, partly because of her insipid
performance and partly because the two characters she played were not
particularly interesting.</P>
<P>Robert Blake, as an androgynous creep, is mysteriously portrayed as some
sort of specter, who could be Renee and Alice in another form. Even
Loggia has two identities and names, Mr. Eddy and Dick Laurent. I'm not
exactly clear what it means, but a lot of things in this film serve as
doubles, including the couple's house which is a double for the Lost
Highway Hotel, where some heavy-duty action takes place in the film's
concluding moments.</P>
<P>Both Bill Pullman and Balthazar Getty are effective in their roles, as
they both seem to be acting in a low-key mode. While the Loggia role was
too predictably gangsterish and seen too often in recent films to bring
much to the table here (it was second-rate in maniacal comic-viciousness
compared to Hopper's same type of role in Blue Velvet). The movie was
somewhat effective not because of the actors or the story, but because
it was elusive, atmospheric, unpredictable, different in form, and
gracefully ethereal. It was a film that took chances, resulting in an
uneven work, but in its dark moments was able to shine as a haunting
film. If one wishes to make sense of this film, it would have to be done
on a metaphorical level, and it would take dismissing logic and loving a
film that relishes in its darkness and obscurity.</P>
