<P>     A woman enters a secret laboratory filled with screeching, caged
animals, each the product of evil scientific experiments.  While
there's no sign "Raw Meat" tattooed on her forehead, anyone familiar
with the genre knows her chances of getting out alive.  Cut to later
that evening, when hard- hitting TV reporter Lori Tanner (Ally Sheedy,
looking like she should have stayed in bed) breaches the
apparently-impenetrable security at a company called EMAX (which
consists of a solitary guard who's never on duty and any number of
unlocked doors).  There, Lori finds animal atrocities, and decides to
release a lovable 200-pound dog named Max and take him home.  Dr.
Jarret (Lance Henriksen) is suitably upset by the dog-napping, and lets
the police know his feelings in yet another embarrassingly over-the-top
performance by an actor I once respected.  The problem is that Max
isn't a normal dog (what a surprise!), but a genetically engineered
killing machine, and the drug that keeps him under control is about to
wear off.  Instead of MAN'S BEST FRIEND, we're about to get MAD DOG IS
GORY.</P>
<P>     Actually, there aren't too many deaths in this movie, but in some
ways that's unfortunate, because when MAN'S BEST FRIEND isn't adding to
its body count, it's spending time showing the characters running
around getting nothing done, engaging in poorly-written dialogue, or
participating in some inane expository scene.  Admittedly, there are a
few nice touches (such as Max's "courting" of a female dog to the tune
of "Puppy Love") which show that writer/director John Lafia was willing
to make occasional stabs at parody.  One could make a case, I suppose,
that the entire movie is a wonderfully-conceived satire, but I don't
think that was intention, nor does the overall script seem to bear out
such an interpretation.</P>
<P>     Possibly the most bizarre sequence in MAN'S BEST FRIEND, and
certainly the one to get cat-lovers up in arms, is when Max chases an
orange tabby up a tree, follows it, then eats it whole.  The cat's
apparent crime is to have annoyed a couple of kids who, frankly, have
personalities that make them appealing dog-fodder (it doesn't happen;
no one under the age of 18 gets mauled).</P>
<P>     If there was any question of the direction in which Ally Sheedy's
career is going, it's answered here, where she turns in a
non-performance in which she somehow manages to get out-acted by a
dog.  Lance Henriksen, whose career peaked in ALIENS, notches another
unimpressive credit for his already-tarnished resume.  The most
interesting thing about Dr. Jarret is his short bleached-blond hair.</P>
<P>     As horror/thriller movies go, MAN'S BEST FRIEND has a double
disadvantage:  it's slow-moving and the monster dog isn't immune to
bullets.  In fact, the ending is so abrupt and anticlimactic that it
will leave many veterans of the genre feeling cheated.  (Where's the
inevitable resurrection where the bad guy comes back for a second
go-'round?)  This film has the capacity for disappointing just about
everybody, especially someone who walks in expecting to see BEETHOVEN'S
SECOND.</P>
