<P>THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR by DeWyNGaLe    Rating: B</P>
<P>The Thirteenth Floor, the third in what I would call "the reality check movie
series", is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year,
The Matrix and eXistenZ.  All three made you think, made you wonder what is
real, what isn't, and if our world is just a huge game.  The Thirteenth Floor
doesn't reach the level of originality, creativity, and curiosity sparked by
The Matrix and eXistenZ, but it certainly gives a great shot at it.  In The
Matrix, we were told that the humans are simply a virus.  In eXistenZ, we
learned that our life could be just a game.  In The Thirteenth Floor, we learn
that we are just electronic devices, living under another world of electronic
devices.  There is just one world on top of another, and everything in them are
fake and electronically generated.</P>
<P>The Thirteenth Floor took a huge, risky turn that I didn't expect it to take,
and I'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make.  Rather than focusing
just on the reality parts of the film, The Thirteenth Floor becomes a murder
mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds.  After the mysterious
murder of computer program designer Hammond Fuller, played by Armin
Mueller-Stahl, Douglas Hall, played by Craig Bierko, a man that worked under
Fuller for many years, must travel through an electronic computer device that
Fuller was using, to the year 1937, which consists of computer generated
characters only.  The simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden
days.  All of the people involved are just characters, or are they?  Douglas
strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their
world to ours, and killed Fuller.  Along the way, Douglas interacts with many
different potential suspects, and a woman who claims to be the daughter of
Fuller, Jane Fuller, played wonderfully by a talented young actress, Gretchen
Mol.</P>
<P>The Thirteenth Floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going,
and doesn't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer's
interests.  I was worried that this film would be too much like The Matrix and
eXistenZ, and I wouldn't enjoy it, but there were enough twists and turns to
keep me thinking and attentive to the film.  Unfortunately, many potential
would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content, letting
the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened.  The scenes
that aren't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere, leaving you
wondering, " What is the point of this?"  </P>
<P>Sometimes it was hard to believe that this story, with terrible dialogue, some
bad acting, especially from Craig Bierko, and scenes that go absolutely
nowhere, are actually true.  I know this isn't a true story or anything, but a
film should be able to make you think that it is.  On the plus side of acting,
we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece
Shine in 1995 actor, Armin Mueller-Stahl. In The Thirteenth Floor, he is back
and is still giving believable and amazing performances.  Another plus is
Gretchen Mol's realistic performance, creating her character with depth, not
just staying in the one-dimensional phase.</P>
<P>Don't expect the intensity of The Matrix or eXistenZ to come out of The
Thirteenth Floor, just expect another film that messes with your mind for
awhile, and shuts you down like any other movie would.  Thrills, chills, and
spills aren't what you will get in this film, but you will just get another
trip to send your mind on, scrambling it until you've had enough.  </P>
<P>The Bottom Line- Let's hope this is the last of the "reality check" based
movies for awhile.</P>
