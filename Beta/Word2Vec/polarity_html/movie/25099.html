<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This riveting noir thriller was made on the heels of the Kefauver crime
hearings in the U.S. Senate. Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) is the loving
family man and inscrutable homicide sergeant, called in to investigate
an obvious suicide of a veteran policeman. Concluding the investigation,
he receives a call from Lucy Chapman about the suicide, who tells him
she has some information. He visits where she works as a bargirl
hustler, skeptically listening as she tells him that she was Tom
Duncan's girlfriend and that he didn't commit suicide. Bannion has a
judgmental thing about women, looking at them as either saints or
whores. His wife is a saint, Lucy is a whore... . But Bannion is
dutiful, so he goes back to the widow to recheck the reason for the
suicide, as she tells him again, it was because of a terminal illness.
But, Bannion is skeptical, as he is left without any doctor's report as
proof. He also wants to know about the expensive summer home the cop
owns and how he got it on a policeman's salary. Bertha Duncan (Jeanette
Nolan) is not pleased with the visit and telephones the crime boss in
the city, Mike Lagana (Scourby), that she doesn't want him around her
house anymore. Lagana arranges with the police commissioner to get
Bannion to forget the investigation.</P>
<P>Bannion is ordered the next day by his boss, Lt. Wilkes, to stay away
from her, telling him there is pressure coming down on him from the
higher-ups. But Bannion soon learns that Lucy Chapman was found tortured
to death on a deserted road. It is out of his jurisdiction, but he still
investigates her death. He knows her death was connected with her seeing
him and now believes Lucy was telling the truth about Bertha Duncan,
that she has replaced her husband on Lagana's payroll because she has
some incriminating evidence against the organization her husband left
and is blackmailing them with it.</P>
<P>Bannion goes to Lagana's house and tells him that he knows he's behind
all the city corruption and behind Lucy's murder. Lagana retaliates by
having his men put a dynamite
bomb in his car, which kills Bannion's wife by accident.</P>
<P>Bannion is forced to go on a solo crusade when he discovers the police
commisioner is on Lagana's payroll; he is suspended from the force after
insulting the commissioner.</P>
<P>Bannion opens up a can of worms, showing that the city is being
corruptly run by the egomaniacal Lagana, and that the police
commissioner and some city council members play poker with his henchmen,
Vincent Stone (Marvin).</P>
<P>Stone is a latent homosexual psychopath who does contract killings for
the big boss, living with his moll in an abusive but materially
rewarding relationship for her. The moll is the sexy but ditsy Debby
(Grahame). The most unforgettable scene in the film is when Stone reacts
violently when he learns that Debby was seen talking with Bannion and
tosses a pot of scalding coffee at her, which permanently scars one side
of her beautiful face.</P>
<P>There is no stopping Bannion now, as with the methodical ease of a
professional hit man, he takes on the syndicate, using his anger from
his wife's murder and the contempt he has for his fellow officers'
cowardly behavior, to take it out on the mobsters. He becomes just as
menacing in his actions as the crime boss, leaving a trail of death
behind him.</P>
<P>His solace comes, when his faith in human beings is restored, as a
crippled secretary (Evanson) goes out of her way to help him identify
the one who killed his wife, when old army veterans who served with his
in-law band together to protect his threatened young daughter, and when
some of his fellow officers can't take the corruption anymore and stop
worrying about their pension to offer him support.</P>
<P>The film's title is derived from the big heat that comes down on the
gang when Mrs. Duncan is murdered by Debby, who can't forgive Vince for
what he did to her. Mrs. Duncan's death releases all the dirt on the
syndicate. For Bannion, this is seen as a hopeful sign that people can
change. Debby's courage heartens him again and allows him to return to
being a homicide detective. Her death at the hands of Vince, comes as
she returns to his apartment to scald him in the face so that he can
also look like she does. Her death gives her salvation in Bannion's
eyes, as it allows her to be cherished for her good side that has at
last won out from her bad side. He can now tell her about his wife
before she dies, as he no longer considers her to be a whore.</P>
<P>They don't get much better in noir films than this stark and gritty
classic. It has the auteur signature of Lang written all over it, with
outstanding performances from a cast that puts their stamp of reality on
the film. Its nihilistic message about humanity is scarring, Glenn
Ford's pyrrhic victory in the end and his restoration to his old job,
seems to have a cynical feel to it, meaning that violence and corruption
go together in city politics like ham and eggs. It has all of Lang's
concerns put into the film, about a corrupt society, sadistic violence,
the corruption of police officers measured against the stark goodness of
other police officers, and the revenge motif that the film is steeped
in, which allows Lang to show, that by doing what is right you must pay
a dear price. Institutions break down in the face of corruption and Lang
believes that it is only through individualistic acts that the
institutions can be saved. This is a dangerous film, its message is not
an easy one to receive.</P>
