<P>In 1987 the stock market crashed, and Oliver Stone's WALL STREET was released
to critical acclaim and packed movie houses. WALL STREET lucked out in its
timing; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had, and
though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated, that very
ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential Reagan-era
businessman. Stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs. evil tale
relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange. Critics and
audiences lauded WALL STREET, elevating its status to that of a contemporary
classic. I'm proud to say that I will never be counted as one of them. I found
WALL STREET to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of Stone's
output with its thin caricatures, obvious sentiments, and a charisma barren
performance by the young Charlie Sheen. Stone goes for broke in every scene
(the same could be said for nearly all of his works). This approach tends to
bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions. He directs stock
exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as
if they were in a plummeting airplane. It's all an excuse for Stone to ratchet
up the emotion with false intensity, rather than explore what these situations
are really like. I have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically
manipulative (as they are presented in BOILER ROOM) rather than laughably over
the top. These guys are salesmen after all, not televised judges.</P>
<P>More than anything I am baffled by why so many adore WALL STREET. The only
possible solution I can muster is its release date. And not just the timeliness
of the "Greed is Good" subject matter: The film was plumped down in the
eighties, a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form, and a
group of glamorous Brat Packers smirked their way through inane high concept,
low result movies. In my mind, the eighties will forever be remembered as a
decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies, but bad music, bad hair,
and bad clothes. Maybe Stone's After School Special set in Wall Street was
viewed as a welcome change of pace.</P>
<P>BOILER ROOM is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to Stone's
piece of crap. They both feature a consequential father-son relationship,
though BOILER ROOM'S is much more subtle and touching. And they are both
concerned with the power of greed, yet the men in BOILER ROOM are akin to
poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth, heartless
Gordon Gecko figures of WALL STREET. BOILER ROOM is a message movie as well,
though (at least until the end) doesn't shove it in our faces.</P>
<P>BOILER ROOM is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will
go for that cash. As I said, this film is indeed timely in a society where WHO
WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE is the number one prime time show every day (bringing
about a revolution of prime time TV watching that hasn't been seen in quite a
while); not only do we want to be millionaires, we want to watch other people
become millionaires! In our super-judgmental, power-oriented culture the desire
for money supersedes everything; when you have money, you have it "all".
And Seth (Giovanni Ribisi) wants it "all" the easy way. He's a well-intentioned
college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage
firm (the kind that sells junk stock) whereupon he meets others just like him.</P>
<P>Ben Affleck is cast as Jim, the company headhunter, who struts in commanding
the room like a frat boy Gordon Gecko. His job is to influence trainee's into
becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their
man hood. It's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of B.S that
they're told to dish out to prospective buyers. Affleck's character is
obviously supposed to recall Alec Baldwin's similar character in GLENGARY GLEN
ROSS, and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance. Affleck shouts,
curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like Baldwin, minus the edge.
When Alec played the scene he became the part, spewing those brutal lines as if
they were his own. By comparison Affleck simply looks as if he were doing a
really hammy line reading.
The brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks: They storm
to work like football players on the way to the big game. Rap music thumps on
the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are:
intellectual gangsters. They aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood
especially during leisure time where the lumbering Scott Caan seems all too
eager to use his fists in minor disputes. We drink up this world along with
Seth, and watch him become seduced by it, just like we might be.</P>
<P>As in all cautionary tales, BOILER ROOM begins with seducing us into its
illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing, then smacks us with the
consequences of all the recklessness. I know this story. We all do. But it can
work if it's told with intelligence and energy, and that is how writer\director
Ben Younger tells it. As a director of (please excuse my French) mise-en-scene
Younger has much to learn. His style is sitcom bland. But his writing isn't.
Younger's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch; his dialogue
is like a junior David Mamet.</P>
<P>Despite the moderate camera work Younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with
tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script. The
brokers\hucksters counter every customer objection, gently bullying them into
buying stock. These moments are filmed like psychological action scenes: a
tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn't aware that he
is one.</P>
<P>With the exception of Affleck's brief appearances, the performances are truly
exceptional. Ribisi, who has the edgy looks of a character actor, is extremely
potent here, working his pale angular face, and eerie, plaintive stare for all
their worth. He conveys child-like vulnerability (his character seems to hide
in a corner whenever things aren't going his way) in some scenes, and in others
he's ferociously cut throat. The Jekyll and Hyde contradiction works well in
the movie: Ribisi is confident when it's just him and the phone, but cowardly
in front of authority figures including his abrasive father (authoritatively
played by Ron Rifkin).</P>
<P>BOILER ROOM thankfully avoids WALL STREET-like histrionics in the sales-pitch
sequences; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological
ploys. Those ploys are taught to Seth by Chris (Vin Diesel), a kind broker who
alternates between Seth's friend and his mentor. Diesl shines in his minor
role. This week I saw the sci-fi opus PITCH BLACK in which Diesel plays a
completely different role in an equally effective manner. In that film he has
the kind of role that might have gone to Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 80's, and
in BOILER ROOM he has the kind of role that might have gone to Elliot Gould in
the 70's. Nicky Katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what
he can't have.</P>
<P>Nia Long, as the firm's secretary, (a lone black women amongst many white men)
is Ribisi's love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant
as most of the parts this talented actress gets, but develops into something
more interesting. The two make an oddly likeable couple. Long is smart and
brash, and Ribisi is charmingly aloof. At one point he says to her "I'm just
lookin' for some chocolate love". It's a terrible line but Ribisi delivers it
in such an innocuous child-like way, it becomes sweetly endearing.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, towards the end, the BOILER ROOM turns a tad schmaltzy. There is
much crying, hugging, and sorrowful stares. This is okay when taken in small
doses, but Younger's conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo
moments, one following the other. A particular misstep is his attempt to show
the effect that Seth's manipulations have on one of his poor victims. It's not
a bad idea but the execution is lacking, with those scenes feeling tacked on to
further spell out the message. That message being, "Greed is Bad". Yes it's
patently obvious, but BOILER ROOM conveys it by introducing us to a culture
that I haven't seen much of in the movies: The disenfranchised twenty something
entrepreneur. And all WALL STREET did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy
world of saints and sinners. BOILER ROOM offers neither extreme. It gives us
what is in between, and for that I am thankful.</P>
