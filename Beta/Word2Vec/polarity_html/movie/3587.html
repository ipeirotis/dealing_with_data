<P>     DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO is a noir romance/thriller steeped in 
the bizarre, with the accent on "bizarre."  Take away all the weird, 
ultimately pointless mystical mumbo-jumbo and you're left with a story 
that makes very little sense.  Put simply, DESTINY is a mess.  It's a 
colorful, atmospheric mess polished with a hip, pseudo-intellectual 
sheen, but it's still a mess. </P>
<P>     The makers of DESTINY should have heeded the lesson of David 
Lynch's TWIN PEAKS.  Early in its run, when the TV series was a 
character-based mystery with supernatural overtones, it was fun, 
fascinating, and quirky.  But, when the more outlandish elements began 
to dominate, the program became self-indulgent and incomprehensible.  
DESTINY is like TWIN PEAKS at its worst--lots of strange goings-on 
that get "explained" by such facile quotes as "The universe is 
expanding... It's beyond man's power to stem the tide of chaos." </P>
<P>     The story--such as it is--follows the exploits of an escaped 
convict named Julian (Dylan McDermott) who has arrived in Las Vegas for 
two reasons:  to pick up the proceeds of a bank robbery from his
one-time partner Thoreau (James LeGros) and to reclaim his girlfriend 
Lucille (Nancy Travis).  Matters aren't simple, however.  Lucille is 
living with wheeler-dealer Tuerto (James Belushi) and isn't sure she's 
ready to revive a three-year-old relationship.  And the money is gone.  
Apparently, Thoreau was robbed by someone named Johnny Destiny (Quentin 
Tarantino), an ultra-cool dude with perfect hair who has a habit of 
taking swims in glowing pools while little ribbons of electricity kiss 
his body.  But that's because Johnny isn't exactly human--he's the 
embodiment of luck. </P>
<P>     Aside from a script that doesn't care whether the viewer gets it or 
not, there are several significant problems with DESTINY TURNS ON THE 
RADIO.  In the first place, the film thinks it's funnier than it 
actually is.  A significant portion of the dialogue is delivered
tongue-in-cheek, and there are several failed attempts at broader
comedy.  Straight or satirical, it's difficult to appreciate what
director Baran has put up on the screen, and if there's some kind of
joke going on here, it seems to be on those who venture into a theater
to see this movie. </P>
<P>     The cast is barely worth mentioning.  There aren't any standouts, 
and we're forced to watch talented performers like James LeGros mix 
ineffectually with those of lesser ability (James Belushi and Nancy 
Travis).  Quentin Tarantino is on hand, but his role doesn't require 
much more than a sardonic grin, something the actor is easily capable 
of.  Dylan McDermott, who has the most screen time, is flat in a role 
that Nicolas Cage probably could have livened up considerably. </P>
<P>     DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO is swamped with style and atmosphere.  
Often, the visual and audio elements of the film overwhelm the 
admittedly-tenuous storyline and paper-thin characters.  In general, I 
appreciate offbeat pictures, but that's when there's something worth 
searching for beneath the surface.  In this case, once you strip away 
the packaging, all that's left is an empty shell.  Ultimately, the most 
clever thing about DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO is the title. </P>
