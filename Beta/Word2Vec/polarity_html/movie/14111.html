<PRE>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
A film by Steven Spielberg
Starring: Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, and Edward 
Burns</PRE>
<P>    Steven Spielberg's second epic film on World War II is an 
unquestioned masterpiece of film.  Spielberg, ever the student on film, 
has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its 
grittiest, and most powerful entries.  He also managed to cast this 
era's greatest answer to Jimmy Stewart, Tom Hanks, who delivers a 
performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle.</P>
<P>For about 160 out of its 170 minutes, "Saving Private Ryan" is 
flawless.  Literally.  The plot is simple enough.  After the epic D-Day 
invasion (whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular), Capt. John 
Miller (Hanks) and his team are forced to search for a Pvt. James Ryan 
(Damon), whose brothers have all died in battle.  Once they find him, 
they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go 
home.  Accompanying Miller are his crew, played with astonishing 
perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational.  
Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Davies, and 
Burns are the team sent to find one man, and bring him home.</P>
<P>The battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary.  
Literally.  There is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that 
will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the 
film's first 20 minutes.  Spielberg films almost the entire movie 
without music, leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion, and 
they do to perfection.  The sequences in France, all of them, beginning 
with the battle and ending with the battle, are fabulous, especially the 
dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and 
countrysides, trying to save Private Ryan.</P>
<P>There are no words I can use to describe the true horror and power 
of these sequences.  This is what Coppola was looking for in "Apocalypse 
Now", but couldn't create.  The sheer horror of these sequences all but 
condemn war.  The performance by Hanks as the leader of this gang is 
also extraordinary.  He is head and shoulders above of the rest of the 
actors in the world, with his comic timing, dramatic flair, his quiet 
emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears.  Hanks is this country's 
finest actor, and he proves it here.</P>
<P>However, Spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece.  With a 
chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time, Spielberg 
creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film.  The sequence involving 
Army Chief-of-Stafff George Marshall and Mrs. Ryan is decent, but 
doesn't hold up to the rest of the film, relying on wartime cliches to 
power it.  But that is forgivable.  What isn't is the bookends of the 
film, the cemetary sequences.  The first one is quite good, a decent 
introduction into the lives of these men.  The last sequence is 
atrocious.  The forced emotion, accompanied by a ridiculous piece of 
music, is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film.  
These flaws are what downgrade "Ryan" from the greatest film of our era, 
to the greatest war film of our era.  Spielberg should have trusted his 
own material, and he should have trusted Hanks to deliver the most 
chilling line of the movie, to end his masterpiece right there.  The use 
of the flag, though patriotic, is in contrast to the movie's theme.  The 
power of the bulk of the film, however, is astonishing.  Spielberg has 
truly made a wondrous work of art, that persists even after first 
viewing of the film, is extraordinary.  This is the film of the year.</P>
