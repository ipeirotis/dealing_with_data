<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Following on the heels of "The Exorcist", "The Omen" is another
box-office success, one of many commercial horror thrillers spawned in
the 1970s, and much better critically than most others. It is even a
more satisfying film than The Exorcist. What makes this film so
captivating, is how it relies on narrative and not special effects to
build on tension.</P>
<P>It's June the 6th, in Rome, at 6 a.m. (notice how that reveals the
configuration of 666, the number of Satan in John's Revelations), when
an American diplomat, Robert Thorn (Peck), learns from Father Spiletto
that his child has died at birth and he is given the unethical
proposition of switching babys, not going through an adoption procedure
because his wife Kathy (Lee) wants her own child. A baby becomes
available because at the same time of his child's delivery, another
woman without any relatives, gave birth to a healthy child, but she
dies. Robert accepts this switch, believing it would crush his wife to
learn of their child's death. But, he doesn't tell her of his good deed.
This adorable cherub turns out to be none other than the Antichrist.
There must be a moral here about accepting someone else's baby from a
priest without playing by the rules. Or maybe, by taking the Bible
literally, that can become a problem. Because the film will play on the
biblical induced fears found in the book of Revelations, whose
prophesies tell how Armageddon will take place through the rise of the
Antichrist from the hands of a politician.</P>
<P>How this film gets to hold its head higher than most of the other films
of this nature, is because the acting is first-class, the telling of the
story is tight, and the criss-crossing between London, Rome, and
Jerusalem, is suspenseful. The film is in constant motion, so it is made
difficult to stop and think, and reflect how much hokum there is in the
story.</P>
<P>Bizarre happenings start to take place in the Thorn's new home in
London, as Robert has been appointed the ambassador to Great Britain.
His first nanny (Palance-Jack's daughter) hangs herself at Damien's
(Harvey) five year old birthday party, after a black rottweiler (I've
never been partial to that breed), who is a dog sent from hell, appears
at the party. The dog acknowledges Damien as a friend and goes back into
the woods, but will reappear whenever Damien needs protection.</P>
<P>A photographer from the papparazzi, named Jennings (Warner), gets a
picture of the suicide, and will become fascinated with the ambassador,
taking many other photos of him and his family.</P>
<P>There follows a string of bizarre events concerning Damien. Damien is at
the zoo, as giraffes flee from him and baboons attack the car he is in
with his mother. And, oh yes, there's a strange hiring of the new nanny,
Mrs. Baylock (Billie). She looks as if she came straight out of hell, in
fact, it later is revealed that she is an apostate from hell, here to
help bring Damien into the devil's fold. In one scene, she warns Kathy
not to bring Damien to the Episcopal church, he's too young to
understand those rituals. But the Thorns get prickly about what she
said, and sure enough, when their limo gets near the church, Damien
tries to scratch his mother's eyes out.</P>
<P>The next bizarre twist comes by way of a Father Brennan, who acts as if
he had a nervous breakdown. He tries to communicate with the stubborn
ambassador about how the child they have is Satan, but unfortunately his
way of communicating, is by ranting that he saw the child at birth and
knows what a monster he is. That is something no parent wants to hear
about their baby. So, I can't really blame the very prudish and
politically sensible Thorn for not believing the priest. But, when he is
told by the priest that his wife is in danger, he meets the priest in
the park and is told to go to a certain area in Jerusalem and get the
excorcist there to tell him how to kill his Antichrist son. Naturally,
Robert tells the priest to take a powder. But in next morning's
newspaper he reads of how the priest was found dead, transfixed by a
lightning rod that came from the nearby church. This gets Thorn's
attention, at last.</P>
<P>The ambassador becomes very worried, helped by Jennings, who notices
something strange in all the photos he has taken of the Thorns, and then
the ambassador becomes even more troubled by the news that his wife's
fall, induced by Damien and Mrs. Baylock, requires hospitalization, as
she loses the baby he didn't realize he was having until Father Brennan
told him about it. All this leaves the ambassador befuddled, looking
only as Gregory Peck can look, when things that are supposed to make
sense don't.</P>
<P>With the aid of Jennings, Thorn goes to Rome to locate the hospital
records and the mother of his adopted baby, and also to see Father
Spiletto again. And after a few shocks here, he goes to Jerusalem and
finally tracks down the exorcist (McKern) Father Brennan told him to
see. While in Jerusalem, there are a few more shocks, and the story
excitedly swings back to London. Here, a few more shocks develop. The
film succeeds because it knows how to tell a suspenseful story and not
rely on green vomit for its shocks, like The Exorcist resorted to, as
The Omen manages to have its shocks look sensible and seem convincing.</P>
