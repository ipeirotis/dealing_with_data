<P>     THE FULL MONTY is the third recent dramatic comedy to emerge from 
the United Kingdom to illustrate the effects of unemployment on the 
individual and the family.  Like BRASSED OFF! and THE VAN, THE FULL 
MONTY combines humor with light drama to explore the manner in which a 
group of men cope with the emotional and financial toll of being "force 
adjusted."  Moreso than its two immediate predecessors, however, THE 
FULL MONTY is interested in getting the audience to leave the theater 
with a warm feeling, and, considering this undemanding agenda, it's 
reasonably successful.</P>
<P>     No one would ever call THE FULL MONTY ambitious.  In fact, with its 
confident reliance upon formulaic situations and familiar characters, 
it's anything but that.  Most of the credit for the film's success must 
go to the game troupe of actors and director Peter Cattaneo, who allows 
the story to develop in an unforced, easygoing manner.  Originality may 
be at a premium here, but THE FULL MONTY offers plenty of opportunities 
for laughter and genial smiles.</P>
<P>     The movie opens in Sheffield, England, a major steel working city 
whose central industry has been modernized and mechanized.  Productivity 
is up, but the victims of the automation are the workers, many of whom 
have been laid off.  THE FULL MONTY focuses on one such man, Gaz 
(Scottish actor Robert Carlyle, who played Begbie in TRAINSPOTTING), who 
can't find an appealing job and is hundreds of pounds behind on child 
support payments to his ex-wife, Mandy (Emily Woof).  Gaz's best friend, 
Dave (Mark Addy), and his former boss, Gerald (Tom Wilkinson), are also 
unemployed.  Their collective inability to find work is eating into 
their self-esteem.  Gaz's son doesn't want to spend time at his dad's 
house because it's always cold, Gerald is frightened to tell his credit 
card-obsessed wife that he doesn't have a job, and Dave loses his 
ability to perform sexually. </P>
<P>     Things change when the Chippendales arrive in Sheffield to perform 
a show.  The tremendous crowds that turn out for the event give Gaz an 
idea.  If male strippers who don't take it all off can rake in the 
money, what about those who are willing to show "the full monty"?  In 
short order, Gaz has recruited an unlikely group of dancers:  a sad 
loner (Steve Huison), an aging black man with rhythm and a bad hip (Paul 
Barber), and a cheerful, well-endowed young man (Hugo Speer) who has the 
body but not the moves.  Drawing upon Gaz's enthusiasm and Gerald's 
experience as a ballroom dancer, the band of six develop a routine, 
dancing with and without clothes to the songs of Donna Summer, Gary 
Glitter, and Tom Jones.</P>
<P>     Unlike other recent stripper movies (SHOWGIRLS and STRIPTEASE, for 
example), THE FULL MONTY throws pretended eroticism out the window.  
There isn't a sexually provocative moment in the film.  The nudity is 
discretely handled, although the actors did in fact perform a live strip 
show in front of 400 extras in a sequence that was, according to the 
director, "a one-take deal."  This lends a degree of spontaneity to THE 
FULL MONTY that makes the movie's climactic scenes more believable and 
enjoyable.</P>
<P>     The degree to which the actors manage to bring their characters to 
life is a key reason why THE FULL MONTY is a little better than 
countless other pictures with similar goals.  The six members of the 
group relate well to each other and engage our sympathy.  Robert Carlyle 
plays Gaz with the right mix of pathos and energy.  The actor continues 
to impress with his range, adding this film to an impressive resume that 
includes Ken Loach's RIFF-RAFF, Michael Winterbottom's GO NOW, and the 
aforementioned TRAINSPOTTING.  Tom Wilkinson (SENSE AND SENSIBILITY) has 
the "stuck up bastard with a good heart" role down pat.  And, as the 
overweight Dave, Mark Addy brings to the fore feelings of insecurity 
that almost anyone can relate to.  </P>
<P>     THE FULL MONTY is basically about overcoming adversity and 
succeeding is spite of certain perceived shortcomings (no pun intended).  
Cattaneo borrows a tactic that numerous, recent Australian comedies have 
adopted:  incorporating a slew of pop hits into the soundtrack.  What 
THE FULL MONTY lacks in depth, it makes up for in good will and 
likeability.  This isn't a great movie, but it's breezy, enjoyable, and 
easy to sit through.  And sometimes, even when dealing with a serious 
issue like unemployment, that can be the perfect tone to drive home a 
message.</P>
