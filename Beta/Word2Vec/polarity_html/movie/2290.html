<P>     What happens when you have low-budget, low-profile motion picture
that turns into an unexpected smash hit?  You make a sequel, of
course.  And, as proven by SISTER ACT 2, as long as you have the star
of the original, there's absolutely no need to concern yourself with
little details like plot, characterization, or acting.</P>
<P>     Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg) has returned to her Las
Vegas act, although this time to considerably more applause than she
experienced at the beginning of the previous movie.  It doesn't take
long for the sisters from the convent to show up and plead their case.
They are now teaching at St. Francis High School in San Francisco, and
the kids are out of hand.  Could Deloris return with them, resume her
alter ego of Sister Mary Clarence, and help sort things out?  After a
little friendly, nun-style persuasion, she agrees to don her habit
again, and the rowdy students at St. Francis High get a new music
teacher.</P>
<P>     If there's one thing that SISTER ACT 2 does, it makes the viewer
appreciate the first installment of the series.  During the course of
this film, I found myself longing for the original--and that's
especially surprising because I wasn't fond of it.  Nevertheless,
chapter one had quite a bit more going for it than this sorry excuse
for a sequel.</P>
<P>     SISTER ACT was occasionally enjoyable because of the freshness and
energy with which the pop-turned-gospel songs were performed.  This
time around, with the exception of the closing number ("Ain't No
Mountain High Enough"), that exuberance is missing.  In fact, most of
the fifties and sixties songs have been replaced by rap numbers, and I
can assure you that the technique doesn't work nearly as well.  How
many people really want to hear a rap version of "Joyful, Joyful"?</P>
<P>     Also missing in action is Harvey Keitel (Yeah, I know his
character is supposed to have ended up behind bars, but since when has
that stopped anyone?), who was one of the better performers in the
original.  Wendy McKenna and Kathy Najimy are back, but their roles
have been reduced to microscopic proportions.  If it weren't such a
pleasure to see these two, they might just as easily have been
altogether eliminated.  Of course, Whoopi Goldberg has also returned,
but the less said about her so-called performance, the better.</P>
<P>     The newcomers to SISTER ACT 2 don't do much for the movie.
Michael Jeter, who plays a Franciscan father, isn't especially funny or
entertaining (except during the previously-mentioned closing number,
which is better by far than anything in the one-hundred minutes that
precede it), and I'm still having trouble figuring out why James Coburn
was given a part.  The only one of the new group with any sparkle is
Lauryn Hill, although her character of Rita is sketchily-developed, at
best.</P>
<P>     It's kind of frightening that it took three writers to come up
with this "plot."  The story is pieced together using all sorts of
easily recognizable formulas, each tied to the others by some
ridiculous plot device.  The "dramatic" moments are enough to make even
the most stalwart movie-goer cringe, and the comedy is flat.  That
leaves the musical number to supply redemption, and they're not up to
it.</P>
<P>     Those who like stale, formula-driven comedies with
sickeningly-sweet happy endings, not to mention unbelievably-contrived
plots, will find SISTER ACT 2 an example of good entertainment.
However, I can't promise that everyone who enjoyed the initial
installment will find this one as pleasant a diversion.  The original
was at least an attempt at something a little different.  This one is
exploitation, pure and simple--a blatant grab at milking money from an
idea that's already bone dry.  Maybe the movie-going public in general
will forgive the producers for foisting this one upon them, but after
sitting through it, I'm in no mood to grant absolution.</P>
