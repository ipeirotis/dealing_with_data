<P>     AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS is a failed attempt to recapture the 
humor and horror of John Landis' 1981 feature, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN 
LONDON.  Where the original had comedy, the sequel has the kind of 
revolting silliness that can be found in TV sit-coms.  Where the first 
installment had chills, this one has sequences that are inappropriately, 
unintentionally funny.  In short, while AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON 
has become something of a minor classic in its genre, the woeful AN 
AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS seems destined for late nights on Cinemax (it 
even has the necessary gratuitous nudity).  </P>
<P>     The film opens with a trio of daredevil Americans -- Andy (Tom 
Everett Scott), Brad (Vince Vieluf), and Chris (Phil Buckman) -- 
sneaking up to the top of the Eiffel Tower to drink wine and do a little 
bungee jumping.  Soon they have company in the person of Serafine (Julie 
Delpy), who has decided to end it all.  She jumps, but Andy, with a 
bungee cord attached, goes after her, and manages to save her (at the 
price of a major headache).  Serafine disappears, but a smitten Andy 
seeks her out.  However, once he learns his would-be girlfriend's dark 
secret, he wishes he hadn't.  She's a werewolf, cursed to change into a 
hideous beast when the moon is full, and, to make matters worse, he has 
suffered a nasty bite himself.</P>
<P>     Actress Julie Delpy is far too good for this movie.  She imbues 
Serafine with spirit, spunk, and humanity, which gives us an emotional 
stake in the character's fate.  This isn't necessarily a good thing, 
since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN 
PARIS as a completely mindless, campy entertainment experience.  Delpy's 
injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the 
specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a 
better cast surrounding her.</P>
<P>     Delpy's previous credits include such memorable ventures as 
Krzysztof Kieslowski's WHITE and Richard Linklater's BEFORE SUNRISE.  
She was radiant, charismatic, and effective in both.  Given the nature 
and level of the material she has to work with here, she gets as close 
as possible to those adjectives.  It could be argued that Delpy is the 
only reason to see AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS, but even her most 
devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss.  And if your 
primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff, check out 
either KILLING ZOE or THE PASSION OF BEATRICE -- those movies have 
intelligible plots in addition to breasts.</P>
<P>     The rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of 
Delpy -- which is to say, they give performances appropriate for the 
screenplay.  Tom Everett Scott (THAT THING YOU DO) plays the lead like 
he's in a made-for-TV movie.  It would be kind to call him bland.  
Actors Vince Vieluf and Phil Buckman, as Andy's friends, are no more 
impressive.  Julie Bowen (HAPPY GILMORE) is suitably fetching as 
werewolf meat.  And respected French actor Thierry Lhermitte has a brief 
turn as another monster meal.</P>
<P>     On the technical side, it's all bad news.  The computer-generated 
werewolves look painfully unreal.  The creatures would probably have 
been more believable had they been men in wolf suits.  Repeated use is 
made of the "werewolf cam", an infrared wolf's point-of-view approach 
that's interesting the first couple of times it's employed, then becomes 
tedious.  And the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes 
that clash violently with the on-screen action they're matched to.</P>
<P>     Director Anthony Waller, who displayed a confident, edgy style in 
MUTE WITNESS, stumbles with this material, never being able to make the 
comedy and horror elements gel.  As a result, we get the worst werewolf 
sequel since THE HOWLING II: YOUR SISTER IS A WEREWOLF.  (I will give 
Waller credit for killing off a dog, though -- something that's rarely 
seen in movies these days.)  AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS is marginally 
entertaining in a "bad movie" sort of way, but that's a dubious 
distinction.  Ultimately, it's an unfortunate effort, for, while it 
isn't unbearable to sit through, it isn't a howl, either.  </P>
