<P>     If you have never had the opportunity to read the press notes for a
Hollywood film, you are missing an art form with more inspired comedy than
most of what they put on the screen.  I'm not saying the humor is
intentional.  Take ANACONDA, for instance, about which co-star Kari Wuhrer
opines in the press notes:  "There is a subtle message in this
film...(about) messing around with what is the most awesome, incredible
power on the planet:  the Amazon Jungle."  You only wish you could see her
try to say that with a straight face, to see what _really_ good acting is.
There are plenty of words one could use to describe ANACONDA, but "subtle"
ain't one of them.  B-movies don't get much B-movie-er than this one,
which doesn't mean it's a bad film.  On its own level -- thanks to some
hilariously ghoulish special effects -- it's actually something of a
guilty pleasure.</P>
<P>     The story begins with a documentary film crew preparing for a trip
down the Amazon River.  Anthropologist Steven Cale (Eric Stoltz) is
searching for a legendary but never-documented native tribe, and brings
along a crew of five people -- director Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez),
cameraman Danny Rich (Ice Cube), sound engineer Gary Dixon (Owen Wilson),
production manager Denise Kalberg (Kari Wuhrer) and narrator Warren
Westridge (Jonathan Hyde) -- to record that search.  But the journey takes
an unexpected turn when the crew finds a man named Paul Sarone (Jon
Voight) stranded on a grounded boat, and agree to take him along.  What
the crew doesn't know is that Sarone has his own agenda for the trip,
which involves tracking down a legendary 40-foot anaconda with a big
appetite and an even bigger attitude.</P>
<P>     I offer a warning here that some of the following information might
be considered spoilers, assuming you have been hermetically sealed away
from pop culture and have never seen a suspense film.  ANACONDA doesn't
work very hard to buck the conventions of the genre; in fact, it seems to
revel in them.  As one might expect, characters die.  As one might also
expect, they generally die in inverse order of their placement in the
credits.  ANACONDA even steals a page from 1980s slasher films by giving a
monster a taste for those with questionable moral fiber.  Smoke a joint?
Dead.  Have premarital sex (or even _think_ about having it)?  Dead.
Shoot a monkey? Dead.  The script serves up stock characters like the
pompous prima donna Westridge and the villainous poacher Sarone with a
giddy disregard for anything but plot, plot and more plot.</P>
<P>     Not that the plot makes much sense (beginning with why the narrator
is along on the shoot in the first place), or even moves very briskly for
a suspense thriller.  Director Luis Llosa (THE SPECIALIST) often can't
seem to decide whether ANACONDA is about the conflict with the snake or
the conflict with Sarone, and it proves to be a mistake to focus on the
shipboard clashes when it means the characters are going to have to talk
for any length of time.  Owen Wilson (BOTTLE ROCKET), a dead ringer for
Dennis Hopper, creates a sense of APOCALYPSE NOW deja vu when he starts
talking about Sarone like he was Col. Kurtz; vapid Kari Wuhrer pronounces
the word "satiated" like someone reading it off the page for the first
time without knowing what it means.  Voight, whose perpetual sneer and
absurd Paraguayan accent make Pacino's performance in SCARFACE look
positively subdued, goes madly over the top and looks like he's the only
person having any fun.  At least Eric Stoltz had the good sense to grab
his check and spend half the film in a coma.</P>
<P>     So why, then, is ANACONDA more fun than glorified B-movies like
TWISTER or INDEPENDENCE DAY?  Because it never pretends to be anything
more, and because it includes the kind of scenes a good monster movie
needs:  moments which leave you laughing even as you are going "eeewwwww."
Sometimes a film only needs one really memorable scene to leave you
feeling a goofy sense of satisfaction.  ANACONDA boasts at least three,
including a shot from inside the snake's digestive system (the
Ana-colon-cam?) and it doesn't even matter that the computer-generated
snake is nobody's idea of state-of-the-art visual effects work.  A B-movie
shouldn't be out to impress you.  ANACONDA is simplistic, and could have
used more of its monster, but it delivers.  I'll look for my "subtle
messages" in movies that aren't about 40-foot-long killer snakes.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 coils of the wild:  6.</PRE>
