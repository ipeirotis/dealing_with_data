<P>     Consider this situation:  two people approach an intersection from
different vantage points.  When an accident occurs, they both observe
the same facts, yet afterwards their versions of events differ
considerably.  Neither is lying; rather, it is the subjective rather
than the objective element of their account which is unique to each
witness.  This sort of difference of perspectives (albeit in other
circumstances) is one theme explored by writer/director David Mamet in
OLEANNA.</P>
<P>     Sexual harassment is certainly an issue of some importance in
today's society.  While it's easy to attack the issue from an obvious
point-of-view (e.g., Michael Crichton's DISCLOSURE), Mamet has decided
against something so clean cut.  Instead, he frames his story around a
series of incidents that could be viewed as either completely innocent
or not.  Ultimately, perhaps the question in OLEANNA is not whether
sexual harassment has been committed, but exactly who is persecuting
whom.</P>
<P>     Given equal time and treatment to the sexual harassment case is an
examination of the significance of today's college education.  What
value is there in a typical college education?  Is it more important to
go through the expected routines--taking notes, reading texts, and
passing exams--than it is to have one's intellect stimulated and one's
interests awakened?  To use Mamet's words, "Is higher education
useful?"</P>
<P>     As titles go, this one is rather obscure.  OLEANNA refers to a
folk story about how a man (named Ole) and his wife (Anna) bought acres
of swampland then sold it as farmland to those who were willing to
invest their lives' savings.  Once the money had been collected, the
pair vanished and the buyers were left with worthless property.  This
became known as the "Oleanna swindle."</P>
<P>     Adapted with almost complete faithfulness from Mamet's own play
(which began its worldwide theatrical run in 1992), OLEANNA is a two-
character piece.  For the most part, the dynamics are played out in a
series of rooms on an unnamed northeastern college campus.  The only
two speaking parts belong to William H. Macy as a middle-aged professor
and Debra Eisenstadt as Carol, a student who comes to him to discuss
why she's failing his course.</P>
<P>     Needless to say, these characters are central to Mamet's
presentation of certain themes.  Their relationship is developed
through three acts, each showing a new phase of their interaction.  In
some ways, the progression of OLEANNA is more like that of a
psychological thriller than that of a drama.  The film spirals in on
itself, twisting from sanity and reason to primal emotion.</P>
<P>     In the first act, Carol approaches the professor (who is left
unnamed) for help.  She's failing his course.  Instead of giving her
conventional advice, the professor explains to Carol his entire
philosophy of education.  She is offended by some of what he says, and
they argue, but their eventual parting seems to be amicable.</P>
<P>     Act two, however, reveals that Carol has filed a protest against
the professor, accusing him of sexual harassment.  Her charges are
accurate in fact, but neither intent nor context are considered.
Bolstered by a group of nameless, faceless supporters, Carol is no
longer the nervous, uncertain girl of act one.  And, as her
self-assurances waxes, the professor's wanes.</P>
<P>     As is always the case, Mamet's dialogue has a rhythm and cadence
all its own.  Early in the film, this, combined with a sluggish tone,
causes OLEANNA to seem staged and unnatural.  Later, however, as the
pace builds, the strengths of what the actors are saying--and how
they're saying it--outstrip the weaknesses.</P>
<P>     By photographing OLEANNA using dim lighting frequently designed to
hood the eyes, motives, and feelings of the characters, cinematographer
Andrezej Sekula (RESERVOIR DOGS, PULP FICTION) enhances the sense of
claustrophobia created by Mamet's restrictive setting.  By the end of
the movie, we in the audience feel as trapped as the characters on
screen.</P>
<P>     OLEANNA is not a conventionally enjoyable experience, but it isn't
intended to be.  The film probes deep into some of the darker facets of
human interaction, and anything with this keen an edge will cause
discomfort.  Three out of four "characteristic" movie-goers are likely
to view this as a bad movie (too slow, too pedantic, too stilted).
OLEANNA, however, is no more intended for that crowd than are they for
it.  This film has been made for those willing to look beneath the
surface to see a taut, intellectual sparring match where there is no
absolute truth.  For these viewers, this picture will leave an
indelible imprint.</P>
