<PRE>THE BIG LEBOWSKI
Rating: ***1/2 (out of four)
R, 1998
Directed by Joel Coen. Written by Joel and Ethan Coen.
Starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore. </PRE>
<P>With the exception of their surrealistic satire Barton Fink, the films of Joel
and Ethan Coen fit into two broad categories: quirky and sometimes darkly
humorous takes on the "film noir" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and
spin increasingly out of control (FARGO, MILLER's CROSSING, BLOOD SIMPLE), and
off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric, scatter-brained lead
character (RAISING ARIZONA, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY). Their latest offering, THE
BIG LEBOWSKI, falls within the latter category, though there are elements of
the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this
film. The main difference, however, is that while the protagonists of RAISING
ARIZONA and THE HUDSUCKER PROXY had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't
quite have the brains to get it all together, the main character of THE BIG
LEBOWSKI seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world, but he
doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling, smoke pot, and
generally relax. </P>
<P>That main character is Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), introduced
by the film's rambling narrator (Sam Elliott) as "quite possibly the laziest
man in Los Angeles county." The Dude is unemployed, needless to say, and
spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends, Walter
(John Goodman), a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun
when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ("Has the whole world
gone CRAZY?!" he shouts at a suspected cheater), and Donny (Steve Buscemi),
who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by
Walter for it ("Donny, you have no frame of reference here!"). These three
seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments, and as the film begins they
are anticipating an important match with rival bowler Jesus Quintana (John
Turturro), who, when we first meet him, is doing a dance in the bowling lane
to accompany a Spanish version of "Hotel California" and, if it's possible,
seems to be even more of a head case than Walter. </P>
<P>If that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone, then
perhaps this will: the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion
by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the Dude's rug. They've mistaken him for
a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the "Big" Lebowski (David
Huddleston) and whose nymphomaniac wife Bunny (Tara Reid) owes money to porn
producer Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara). The Dude goes to the Big Lebowski
seeking compensation for his ruined rug; he doesn't have any luck, but when
Bunny is apparently kidnapped, the elder Lebowski asks him to deliver the $1
million ransom. </P>
<P>Unfortunately, Walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off, and before they
can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers, the Dude's car gets
stolen, along with the briefcase containing the money. Soon, the Dude is being
harassed not only by the Big Lebowski himself but also by Treehorn and by a
group of German "nihilists" who demand the ransom money even though they may
not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place; the Dude and
Walter suspect that Bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort
money from her husband to repay her debts to Treehorn. Meanwhile, the Big
Lebowski's daughter Maude (Julianne Moore), a feminist avant-garde artist who
likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked, wants to recover
the money for her family. </P>
<P>The plot, however, is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters
to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc. The previews for THE
BIG LEBOWSKI feature Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Run Through The Jungle,"
and it fits: the Coens see Los Angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and
nutcases, with the sometimes bewildered Dude left to run through it and try to
avoid any more trouble (usually unsuccessfully). The film doesn't feature
quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the Coens' other comedies (though
there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor, particularly in the Dude's
dream sequences and acid flashbacks), but it more than makes up for it with
the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact. The film
sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the
Coens have not only set their characters loose in this "jungle" but are also
themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations
- but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to
overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic
resolution. </P>
<P>There's also a noticeable (but not too heavy-handed) thread of social
commentary in THE BIG LEBOWSKI, which, incidentally, takes place just as the
Gulf War is about to begin; at the beginning, we see George Bush on television
making his "This aggression will not stand" speech. The Coens take aim at just
about every elite L.A. subculture in the book: the egotistical wealthy
businessman ("The bums will always lose!" shouts the Big Lebowski at one
point), the porn industry, the overbearing Malibu policeman who berates the
Dude for disturbing their "peaceful beach community," and so on. By the end,
we really start to admire the Dude, who almost certainly harbors the least
"aggression" of anyone in this story; his passive resistance (emphasis on
"passive," albeit) to the elite emerges as something more than just another
quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters. He also
turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head, even if he
doesn't like to use it very much; his sarcasm towards Treehorn and the Malibu
policeman shows that he knows when he's getting a run around, and he does
manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end. </P>
<P>The Coens certainly poke fun at the Dude for his laziness, but they don't just
treat him as fodder for cheap shots either. I think that, more than anything,
is what makes THE BIG LEBOWSKI a standout comedy: it manages to approach
characters like the Dude and, to some extent, Walter, with genuine affection
while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained. Audience
members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo
by the end of the movie, given that they seemed like nothing more than the
butts of an extended joke at first. "It's good knowin' he's out there, the
Dude, takin' it easy," posits the narrator towards the end. I dare say that
truer words have seldom been spoken.</P>
