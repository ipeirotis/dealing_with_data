                           (NELLY ET M. ARNAUD)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     NELLY AND MONSIEUR ARNAUD (NELLY ET M. ARNAUD) is a French film
that garnered numerous awards there.  For me the film is a fascinating
character study of Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud, but others will probably
characterize the picture as a romance to which I would not argue.  This
is one of those rare films that appears to have no actors.  These
characters are so realistically drawn that I did not for a minute think
I was observing actors, rather I was eavesdropping on real life.</P>
<P>     First, a warning.  If you must have sex or nudity or if you need
dramatic events and fast pacing to enjoy a movie, do not waste your
time with NELLY AND MONSIEUR ARNAUD as you will be quite disappointed.
This is a film that takes its own sweet time and one with a satisfying
but slightly surprising ending of the sort you hardly ever see in
American films.  Don't try to guess the ending you will be wrong, and
anyway, the fruits to be savored of this film are getting to know the
characters.</P>
<P>     As the story unfolds, Nelly played by Emmanuelle Beart (Manon from
MANON OF THE SPRING and Claire Phelps from MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE among
many films) is at a Parisian cafe confiding her marriage problems with
her friend Jacqueline (Claire Nadeau).  Nelly tells Jacqueline that her
husband, Jerome (Charles Berling), is a couch potato who lost his job
and who is not serious looking for another one.  Nelly lost hers too,
but is doing odd jobs in a futile attempt to attack their mounting
debt.</P>
<P>     Into the cafe comes Monsieur Arnaud played by Michel Serrault (Mr.
Raymond in LES DIABOLIQUES (1954) and 53 other films after that).  It
seems that years ago Monsieur Arnaud had an affair with married and now
43 year old Jacqueline and is still a good friend of hers.</P>
<P>     Whereas Nelly is 25 with the looks of a fashion model, Monsieur
Arnaud is 40 years her senior, but strikingly handsome and
distinguished.  He has gorgeous, straight, silver gray hair, and wears
impeccable suits (costumes by Catherine Bouchard).  Both have excellent
bodies and the camera loves them.</P>
<P>     For good looking characters, their talent has nothing to do with
their physical attractiveness.  Both turn out to be compassionate
people who are good listeners.  Moreover the performances by Beart and
Serrault are compelling and worthy of Academy Award consideration.
Once Monsieur Arnaud hears Nelly's tale of woe, he loans her enough
money to get her out of debt, and he gives her a job transcribing and
editing his memoirs of his time in French Polynesia after the war when
he was a young judge.  Although the job is to be performed in his
apartment, there are no strings attached.</P>
<P>     There is a slight mystery about Monsieur Arnaud since he stopped
being a judge in mid-career and became a wealth businessman.  As he
explains it, "We struck it rich in real estate, making Paris ugly."  He
is in the process of selling his vast collect of rare and not so rare
books telling Nelly, "You reach an age when you read the same few books
over and over."  The reason to see the film is the evolving
relationship between the two of them and their rich conversations
together.  At one point, in jest, he confides in her, "Marry an old man
like me and you'll have liberty, security, and austerity."</P>
<P>     Nelly quickly and amicably divorces her husband and eventually
strikes up a relationship with Monsieur Arnaud's publisher Vincent
(Jean-Hugues Anglade).  Most of the show for me remains a beautiful
character study of two people.  The script by Jacques Fieschi, Claude
Sautet, and Yves Ulmann is exquisite.  Director Claude Sautet takes a
story and slowly wraps his audience into it.  A mesmerizing tale.</P>
<P>     NELLY AND MONSIEUR ARNAUD runs 1:46 with carefully and almost
dreamy editing by Jacqueline Thiedot.  The picture is in French with
easy to follow English subtitles.  The film is not rated, but would be
PG or PG-13.  There is no sex, nudity, or violence.  I remember only a
single mild cuss word.  Given the subject matter, my guess is that it
would not interest kids under 10, but I don't see how it could harm
anyone.  I recommend this delightful talkfest of a film to you and give
it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
