<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>Ever wonder what happened to Gabe Kaplan?  You remember, he was the
title character in that 70's sitcom, "Welcome Back Kotter."  Always
trying to help out the Sweathogs, frequently trying to dodge Mr.
Woodman, ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole.  "So," you ask,
"where is he now?"  Mr. Kaplan actually spends much of his time these
days playing professional high-stakes poker.  That's right.  I'm not
sure if it's his main source of income, but from what I've heard, the
guy occasionally comes away with $20,000 at a time.  And there you
were, thinking I was going to tell you he was doing off-Broadway
theater.  You silly goose.</P>
<P>Well, Gabe Kaplan isn't in the movie ROUNDERS, nor is the film about
the actor come gambler's life.  But ROUNDERS is about poker, and Gabe
plays poker, and I thought that was kind of a neat connection.  Sorry
about the segue, or lack thereof.</P>
<P>Matt Damon plays Mike McDermott, a law student who also has a singular
talent for the game of poker.  He's been playing for a while, and more
than being proficient, he has caught the bug.  He goes to all the
underground games in New York City, knows the regulars, and knows how
to win.  In the beginning of the film, he's built up a nice thirty
grand nest egg, which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor
where the big boys play.   Mike is there to make his bid into the
upper echelon by staking it all against Teddy KGB (John Malkovich), an
Oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the Russian Mafia.  Mike has the
potential to take a large pot and go to Vegas and buy into the World
Series of Poker, but instead he loses it all in a single hand.  Months
later, he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery
truck.</P>
<P>When Mike's best friend and poker buddy Worm (Edward Norton) finishes
his jail term for hustling some students, he wants to pick up right
were they left off, working as a team to part others with their
betting cash.  Although Mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to
his girlfriend and fellow law student, Jo (Gretchen Mol), Worm
connives Mike into playing once more, and Mike, bitten again by the
bug, slides down that slippery slope, risking his relationship,
education, and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of
his life.</P>
<P>To make a film about gambling, a filmmaker will usually have to play
up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters.  This
is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a
leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with
a stogie in his mouth.  ROUNDERS, however, seems to go more for the
latter than the former.  The card clubs Mike and Worm frequent aren't
very glamorous at all.  There's a basement, a lodge with elk heads on
the wall, a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which
director John Dahl sets his shots.  Except for one brief instance when
the two players visit Atlantic City, the film is bereft of the
flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt
table.  The reason ROUNDERS still captures our attention is because it
is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities
which enjoy and are slaves to it.</P>
<P>We're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear
motivations, and good actors to play them.  Matt Damon is very natural
as Mike, who struggles between his desire to play the straight and
narrow by finishing law school, and answering what may be his true
calling, playing professional poker.  Ed Norton's Worm is truly a
worm, always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what
they're worth.  John Turturro, who amazes me with his acting range,
tones it down in this film by playing Joey Knish, a virtual poker
prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent
and child support payments.  He's both a friend and mentor to Mike,
and Turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing, just as John
Malkovich's heavily-accented Teddy KGB is imposing as an adversarial
dragon Mike must slay to prove himself.</P>
<P>Martin Landau is also thrown into the mix as one of Mike's law
professors, Abe Petrovsky.  While Landau slips well into the role, his
character, spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's
self, facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable
ending.  Perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of
acting talent, however, is Gretchen Mol who just didn't seem to have
much presence on screen.  She's a genuine peach to look at, kind of a
cross between actress Renee Zellweger and singer Jewel (and I wouldn't
be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired
triumvirate and attempted to take over the world), but her delivered
lines seemed very flat, and I found myself looking for Matt Damon's
reactions instead.</P>
<P>A good thing about ROUNDERS is that it doesn't get bogged down in the
character development and statement making so much that it can't find
time for humor.  The film is peppered nicely with scenes that both
make you laugh and keep the pacing going, such as a sequence where
Mike and Worm move rapidly around New York from one game to the next,
in widely different locales.  One game in a cigar club had me in
stitches.  "I LOVE the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper," says
one of the players, clearly more interested in displaying his
pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his
other.  I was hoping Mike and Worm would really take these guys.</P>
<P>With all the poker being played, ROUNDERS had the potential to be very
confusing.  You might think you know a lot about poker, but think
again.  Luckily, we're given a narration by Damon during the more
intricate moments to explain what's going on.  The narrations are more
informative than intrusive, and apprise us of what the stakes are and
why certain players want to do the things they do.  It's nice that as
the characters develop, so does our comprehension of their world.</P>
<P>As a film about success and survival in the realm of underground
poker, ROUNDERS delivers in spades.  Wait!  As a film about the
culture of cards, ROUNDERS is an ace.  Hang on!  Packed with great
acting and great characters, ROUNDERS is a full house.  Okay, I guess
that's enough.</P>
<P>Oh, by the way, if you ever want to get into a game with ol' Gabe
Kaplan, be sure to bring a note from Epstein's mother.</P>
