<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A contemporary, "light romantic comedy",  about three childhood friends
from junior high school in New York City's Upper West Side, Jake
(Stiller), Brian (Norton), and Anna (Jenna), who become very close,
doing everything together as a trio. But Anna, who was a very pivotal
part of their life because of her high energy and warmth and manner of
bringing them all together, moves to California and the two boys lose
contact with her, but they still remain best friends. Jake chooses not
to go into his father's lucrative business, instead becomes a rabbi,
while Brian becomes a priest. Anna Banana, as the boys affectionately
call her, returns to New York for her job, after being away for 15-
years. She has become a high-powered corporate executive, and when she
meets the boys at the airport, they see that she is still energetic and
has also grown into a most beautiful woman, attracting both of them. She
acts and looks a lot like Gwyneth Paltrow.</P>
<P>The film runs needlessly on for over two hours and takes this story into
many different areas concerning religious faith, personal goals,
cultures, comedy routines, and romance, with too many themes for it to
adequately cover. It manages to concentrate mostly about taboos in
religious matters, which creates many awkward moments for the filmmaker,
who tries to juggle the themes of an interfaith romance and of a priest
trying to face his vow of celibacy, and of how both men fall for the
same girl. It also depicts how both religious men try to shake up the
complacency in their congregations, mainly with pop culture brought into
their traditional services, and with an interfaith community center they
both initiate featuring karaoke music. Rabbi Jake amusingly brings in a
Harlem gospel choir to sing the Jewish holiday song "Ein Kelohainu."
Both religious men use their abilities as stand-up comedians to fill
their Upper West Side congregations and seem happy with their choice of
vocation.</P>
<P>The film opens with a drunk Brian sitting in an empty bar and telling an
incredulous bartender the story of why he is drunk...the old story of a
rabbi and a Catholic priest... but this time with a slightly different
twist! The film goes into flashback and Brian tells how Jake fell in
love with Anna, but that Jake felt he couldn't do anything about it
because it would break his mother's heart (Bancroft), as he tells of how
she cut off his brother from the family because he married a non-Jewish
girl, and how it would upset the congregation and its conservative
leader (Rifkin), probably causing him to lose his job. Jake's other
problem is that the congregation does not want a bachelor rabbi and
exerts pressure on him to marry a Jewish girl.</P>
<P>Anna's problem is that she is married to the cell phone; she is always
on the job, which leaves her feeling soulless; and, she is thinking for
the first-time now that she is 29-years-old, that life has past her by,
that she might have placed the wrong values about what is important in
life. She is ready to love Jake but because of the cultural problems
involved, the romance is ending.</P>
<P>For Brian, the problem is that he has fallen in love with Anna and
doesn't know about her romance with Jake. When she calls him late one
night when she is upset that Jake left her, he assumes, that she wants
to see him because she feels the same about him and doesn't know what to
do. In one of many awkward scenes, to make its point about religious
restrictions, Brian foolishly starts kissing her and telling her he will
give up his vows for her. She then tells him about Jake...which is the
reason for his drinking binge.</P>
<P>The film spends a lot of energy going back and forth among these
characters, trying to understand why they are all so upset.</P>
<P>In Jake's congregation, the members consider him a most eligible
bachelor and fix him up with their daughters. It shows him on two dates
and both with results that were not as funny as they were intended to
be. On the first, a sexually aggressive date (Edelstein) tries to get
him to take her into the bedroom against his better judgment. On the
second, an ABC news correspondent (Sofer) tries to connect with him over
a dinner date, where he brings along Anna and Brian. There actually
didn't seem to be any reason why he shouldn't be going out with her, but
for Anna, and because the plot of the film is skewed that he shouldn't
meet a Jewish woman.</P>
<P>In between all these serious problems, the film is able to work best
when it brings in its lowbrow comedy routines and pratfalls in diverse
moments: a thirteen year old boy whose voice is breaking at his
Bar-Mitzvah, the rabbi being an avid collector since childhood of
"Heroes of the Torah" trading cards jumps for joy at receiving a hero
rabbi card, the rabbi faints at a circumcision ritual, the priest
jumping butt-first into the holy water when his robes catch on fire, Ken
Leung as a pushy karaoke machine salesman who loves to sing, and a
hostile security guard who gives the film a Charlie Chaplin slapstick
flavor to it.</P>
<P>The film was only mildly pleasing for the following reasons: Jenna
Elfman was too attractive and had too much of a sunny disposition for
either rabbi or priest, therefore the romance part of the film never
took off. She was what she was, a high-level corporation person on the
rise, more suited for someone in her field than either of these two
childhood friends. The romance between her and the rabbi was not only
unlikely, but not convincingly done. The pace of the film was
meandering, focusing too much attention on close-ups of Jenna and the
side-bar subplots that added nothing relevant to the story. The story
itself, which tried to be cute and touch upon current controversies,
added nothing new by its discoveries. The film stopped dead in its
tracks when it took itself too seriously and a series of sermons were
delivered about how Ben Stiller should resolve his love problem. Its
premise promised something groundbreaking to say about a nice Jewish boy
loving a gentile, but ended up mimicking the traditionalists: if she
wants to marry, let her convert.</P>
<P>What the film did fairly well, was show a tolerant attitude by both the
retiring rabbi (Eli Wallach) and the veteran priest (Milos Forman), who
talked to the younger men in a kind way and gave them helpful reminders
of who they are without trying to force something down their throat.</P>
<P>For first-time director and all-around actor Edward Norton (FightClub/
The People vs. Larry Flynt/ American History X), this was a curious film
for him to choose to direct, since he chose one that is particularly
lightweight, considering some of his acting roles have been in
cutting-edge films, which makes you wonder where he's coming from.. The
results are that the film is more awkward than controversial, more
secular in spirit than religious, and it revisits grounds that are all
too familiar and have been done far better by people like Woody Allen.
That love wins out over faith, should surprise no one who has watched
Hollywood films over the years and how they love to give people the
endings that make them feel-good, and most people feel-good when they
see lovers who love each other be together in the end. The best one can
say about this film, was that its heart was in a better place than its
script. The worst that can be said about it, was that its responses to
the controversies it brought up, were decided in too timid a way for the
film to leave any impact.</P>
