<PRE>Brief Comments:
The Tigger Movie -- ** (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>Film Criticism By Zachary McGhee
Rated G, 77 minutes, 2000. Walt Disney.
Directed by Jim Falkenstein.</PRE>
<P>I feel kind of bad so casually dismissing kindhearted kids' fare like "The
Tigger Movie", in which Tigger goes on a search for his "real" family after
being rejected by Pooh Bear and Co. when he requests that they go bouncing with
him and demands that, eventually, they all discover that they are his family,
but too much of this film had me thinking that AA Milne would be rotating like
a rotisserie in his grave over this literary sacrilege. The movie's
themeâ€'accepting different kinds of families, particularly adoptiveâ€'is nice
enough, but the metaphor isn't disguised too well. The presence of "Toy Story
2" in the same multiplex had me drawing a mental Venn diagram of their positive
aspects, and ultimately finding the similarities column thin, and the "Toy
Story 2" column about ten times longer than Falkensteinâ€™s obvious potboiler.
Meanwhile, the movie rushes with the narrative, but somehow seems prolonged as
a whole, even though it clocks in at a mercifully short 77 minutes. Nice try,
but something about "The Tigger Movie" just screams "Direct-to-Video".</P>
