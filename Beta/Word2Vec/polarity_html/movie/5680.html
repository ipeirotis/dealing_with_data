<P>     There's nothing particularly deep or challenging about this movie.  
The title, FLED, says it all.  For most of its one-hundred minute 
running length, this is one chase after another.  When the film keeps 
moving, and doesn't dwell on things like character development or plot 
plausibility, it offers a certain minimum entertainment value.  
Unfortunately, there are lulls when attempts are made at exposition, 
and, during those periods, FLED becomes unbearably dull, not to mention 
incredibly stupid.</P>
<P>     Actually, Kevin Hooks' energetic direction, coupled with Laurence 
Fishburne's commanding presence, makes this picture more watchable than 
it has a right to be.  Aside from occasional, clever quips (such as 
tongue-in-cheek references to THE FUGITIVE and Fishburne's Oscar-
nominated performance in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), there's nothing 
remarkable about the creaky script, which does everything it possibly 
can to keep the two leads on the run from good guys, bad guys, and 
everyone in between.  Logic and intelligence have little part in these 
proceedings.</P>
<P>     Since the film opens with a black guy, Piper (Fishburne), and a 
white guy, Dodge (Stephen Baldwin), chained together and on the run, 
it's reasonable to connect FLED with Stanley Kramer's 1958 feature, THE 
DEFIANT ONES, which starred Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier.  The 
similarities are purely superficial, however.  THE DEFIANT ONES was a 
multi-layered film; FLED is pure escapism with nothing under the 
surface.  It's stock bits of LETHAL WEAPON, THE FUGITIVE, and 48 HOURS 
rolled into one.</P>
<P>     Piper and Dodge are working on a Georgia prison work gang when all 
hell breaks loose.  A prisoner gets a gun and starts shooting, killing 
guards and inmates indiscriminately.  Piper and Dodge, who are chained 
together, escape.  Apparently, however, someone on the outside has 
orchestrated their break-out.  Dodge, a top hacker, possesses a computer 
disk containing incriminating information about a major figure in the 
Cuban mob.  Now everyone wants Dodge and his disk, including the mob's 
class-A hitman, the police, and crooked federal agents.  (Bad Feds again 
-- haven't these guys been the villains in every other movie this 
summer?)  During the course of the flight for life, the fugitives are 
helped by Dodge's exotic dancer girlfriend (Brittney Powell) and a 
pretty divorcee (Salma Hayek) who shows interest in Piper.</P>
<P>     Stephen Baldwin, one of the interchangeable acting Baldwin 
brothers, is adequate, and Salma Hayek (DESPERADO) is attractive, but 
FLED's attention magnet is Fishburne.  A consummate professional, he has 
never turned in a sub-par performance, regardless of the quality (or 
lack thereof) of his role.  He's a good friend of Hooks', which explains 
his presence here, but those who sit through this movie won't care why 
he appears -- they'll just be glad he does.  Otherwise, enduring the 
film would be far more difficult.</P>
<P>     There's not much else to be said about FLED.  It's not a complete 
entertainment wasteland, but this is definitely not the time of year to 
distribute such a routine, unspectacular action feature.  It probably 
would have played better against less imposing competition.  So, 
although FLED hints at the promise of its director, who previously
made PASSENGER 57, it's not the kind of picture that will get 
people racing to theaters.  When the movie's over, you're likely to
be left feeling that, despite all the running around, you really 
haven't gotten anywhere.</P>
