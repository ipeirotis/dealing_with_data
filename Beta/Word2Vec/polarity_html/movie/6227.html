<P>     If JUDE strikes you as not at all typical of what you expect when you
think about films based on "classic British novels," it is only because it
is quite faithful to its source material in its subject matter.  Thomas
Hardy's _Jude the Obscure_ was one of the most controversial novels of its
time, one which inspired outraged reaction against its portrayal of
adultery, atheism and marital sexuality.  JUDE's still-relevant theme of
the consequences of non-conformity make it a natural for cinematic
treatment, and Michael Winterbottom has directed a beautifully filmed and
beautifully acted adaptation.  It is somewhat unfortunate, then, that JUDE
is so true to the narrative thrust of Hardy's novel yet falls short in
plumbing its thematic depths.</P>
<P>     Christopher Eccleston stars as Jude Fawley, a working class
Englishman of the late 1890s who is inspired by his schoolmaster Richard
Phillotson (Liam Cunningham) to dreams of becoming university-educated.
While teaching himself the classics, Jude works as a stone-mason, but he
is distracted from his plans by Arabella (Rachel Griffiths), a farmer's
daughter he marries when he believes he has gotten her pregnant.  The
marriage is not made in heaven, however, and Arabella leaves Jude,
allowing him to return to his educational pursuits in the university town
of Christminster.  There Jude meets his cousin Sue Bridehead (Kate
Winslet), a beautiful but highly unconventional young woman who becomes
Jude's close friend.  The friendship grows into something more, but the
circumstances of their lives contrive to keep them apart, and produce
terrible consequences when they reject societal expectations.</P>
<P>     It is often a kind of critical laziness to tick off discrepancies
between a film and its source material, but in the case of JUDE certain
omissions create gaps of logic.  Hossein Amini's script does a largely
superb job of selecting where to condense scenes and delete sub-plots,
losing little relevant narrative information, but there are problems with
the development of character motivations.  Both Arabella and Phillotson
are reduced to minor supporting players, and we don't understand enough
about what their decisions mean to the story.  One pivotal sequence
focuses on Jude's young son, who acts in a manner dependent on Hardy's
characterization of him as almost supernaturally mature and fatalistic.
Ross Colvin Turnbull, the young actor who plays Little Jude, can't quite
muster that quality, and his actions, while startling, don't seem
plausible.  Lost also are many of the contradictory facets of Sue's
personality, particularly her almost phobic aversion to sex.  Hardy's Sue
jumps out a window to avoid sleeping with her husband; Kate Winslet's Sue
becomes Jude's lover in a scene which is played almost as comic.</P>
<P>     That is not to slight Winslet's performance, which is captivating.
She makes Sue a vibrant, intelligent object of desire, a woman who refuses
to accept the roles anyone else imposes on her, and the force of her
spirit makes her fate all the more tragic.  Eccleston is impressive as
well as Jude, whose pursuit of his dreams results in a series of
disappointments but not in the breaking of his will.  Both are well
directed by Winterbottom, who gives JUDE a kinetic energy, though his
rush to include all the critical events in the story might leave you a bit
dizzy.  Also outstanding is the cinematography of Eduardo Serra, both in
the stark black-and-white of the prologue and in the muted colors of the
body of the film.</P>
<P>     JUDE is certainly effective film-making, but it could have been more
_affecting_.  This is a story of people challenging the social order at
their own peril, and once Winterbottom establishes that fact, JUDE is
quite compelling.  It simply takes a terribly long time for him to
establish that fact, and as a result JUDE is an appealing but fairly
conventional star-crossed love story for much of its two hours.  Winslet
and Eccleston are always able to make you care about whether or not Sue
and Jude will find happiness, but Amini and Winterbottom should have been
able to build the understanding that it was impossible.  There are enough
powerful moments and intriguing performances in JUDE to hold your 
interest, and the story still feels daring a century removed from its
publication.  There is just that small missing link that leaves JUDE's
fundamental tragedy a bit too obscure.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 faint Hardys:  6.</PRE>
