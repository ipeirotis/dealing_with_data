<P>     The relentless preachiness engaged in by RED CORNER is the sort of 
approach that makes fire-and-brimstone sermons seem subtle.  If this was 
the film's only weakness, it might be forgivable, but director Jon 
Avnet's latest effort is an all-around stinker.  Pull almost any word 
out of a negative pool of adjectives and you'll have an accurate 
description of RED CORNER:  dumb, boring, painful, laughable, idiotic, 
moronic, inane, bad, etc.  Occasional scenes are almost salvaged by the 
effective performance of little-known actress Bai Ling, but, ultimately, 
her solid portrayal of a Chinese defense attorney gets lost amidst so 
much tripe.  RED CORNER is easily one of the year's worst big-budget 
motion pictures.</P>
<P>     Red China is apparently very upset with Richard Gere.  Not only is 
he an outspoken supporter of the exiled Dalai Lama, but, to add insult 
to injury, he has now starred in a movie that is openly critical of the 
Chinese legal system.  American movie-goers suckered into seeing RED 
CORNER should be equally outraged.  Gere's lackluster performance is one 
of the reasons why the film is close to unwatchable.  He vacillates 
between scenery-chewing and wooden displays that would make Steven 
Seagal proud, and his delivery of Robert King and Ron Koslow's ripe 
dialogue is often so overwrought that it's impossible to stifle a 
snicker.  Truthfully, the Chinese have little to worry about -- no one 
could possibly take this film seriously.</P>
<P>     Gere plays American businessman Jack Moore, who's in Beijing to 
wrap up a major deal with China's Ministry of Radio, Film, and 
Television.  Moore's American-based company is offering a slate of 
"pornographic, violent, and superstitious" Western fare, and, thanks to 
the support of the progressive-minded son (Byron Mann) of the Minister, 
they have the inside track.  Then, one night, Moore brings a Chinese 
girl back to his hotel room for some champagne and sex.  He is rudely 
awakened the next morning by Chinese police officers, who show him her 
dead body, point out that his clothes are soaked in her blood, then cart 
him off to prison.  Worse still, it turns out that the dead girl is the 
daughter of a high-ranking Red Army general.  Since American lawyers are 
not permitted to practice in China, Moore is forced to make due with 
Yuelin (Bai Ling), his court-appointed attorney.  Her advice:  plead 
guilty, since the legal code reads "leniency for those who confess; 
severity for those who resist."  But, despite being mistreated by his 
jailers and ignored by the American embassy, Moore is determined to 
prove his innocence.  </P>
<P>     In the past, with movies like FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, director Jon 
Avnet has successfully navigated the tricky line between drama and 
manipulation.  Here, he fails utterly.  There isn't a dramatic moment in 
RED CORNER that rings true -- not Moore's sad family history, his 
"courageous" moral stance in defense of Yuelin, nor the predictably 
over-the-top climactic court sequences.  For good measure, there's also 
one of the silliest foot chases in recent memory, with a handcuffed 
Moore leaping from rooftop to rooftop while half the Beijing police 
force inexplicably fails to catch up to him.</P>
<P>     The heroes in RED CORNER are few and far between.  Aside from the 
lone good American (Moore) and the one good Chinese citizen (Yuelin), 
it's hard to find someone who isn't duplicitous, self-serving, or 
downright evil.  Cartoon characterizations abound, and it isn't just the 
Chinese who suffer; every Westerner in RED CORNER has hidden motives, 
and no one except Yuelin is willing to risk their neck or career to 
stand up for an innocent man.</P>
<P>     From time-to-time, RED CORNER falls into the "so bad it's 
enjoyable" category, but the movie is much too long to be more than 
fitfully engaging for connoisseurs of awful films.  Those hoping for an 
intelligent expose of the Chinese legal system will likewise be 
disappointed -- the movie's political agenda is obvious, but not 
effectively presented.  This is yet another example of the white 
outsider struggling against oppression and injustice (Avnet has already 
used this approach once, in 1992's THE POWER OF ONE).  Maybe somewhere, 
buried deep under layers of dross, there's the kernel of an interesting 
story in RED CORNER.  But what reaches the screen is so irredeemable 
that it deserves to be consigned to the darkest, most obscure shelves of 
the local video store.</P>
