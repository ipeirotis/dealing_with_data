<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A taut suspense yarn in B&W, that plays like noir because of all the
eerie shadows on the wall and the conviction for murder of an innocent
man. David Starrling (Zachary Scott) is a wealthy architect, living in a
penthouse apartment, who has a cute 6-year-old daughter Susan (Gigi) by
his deceased wife. His new wife Celia (Kristine) is very attractive but
Susan hasn't warmed up to her. David lovingly gives Susan a doll called
Cupid as a coming home present and gets his wife perfume, as Susan says,
"She doesn't like perfume because it smells."</P>
<P>When David returns home after a six-week absence, his daughter gleefully
greets him, but his wife is not there. When David is in his building's
lobby, he sees his wife kissing his sister-in-law's fiancé, Crane
Weymouth (Helmore), after being driven home by him.</P>
<P>That evening Crane and Celia's sister, Dell Faring (Ann Sothern), come
over for dinner and David catches the two in a lie about where they were
that day. Dell is upset that her sister is having an affair with her man
and excuses herself from the dinner engagement.</P>
<P>Later on in the evening, the spat continues between David and Celia, as
he walks toward her with a loaded gun, and she, fearful he is going to
shoot her, knocks him out by hitting him with a mirror. Meanwhile, Dell
has returned to the apartment to talk with her sister and tells her that
she hates her for always taking away everything she has always wanted.
Celia tells her we'll talk about it in the morning and gives her David's
gun, afraid to keep it in the house when David regains consciousness. By
accident, Dell kills her sister, and the little girl who was awakened in
her bedroom next door, comes into the darkened room and sees the shadow
on the wall of a lady wearing a hat with a feather. It reminds her of
her new Indian doll, Cupid. Susan's screams bring the police and David
is charged with the murder. He doesn't remember a thing but is convinced
he must have killed his wife. He will be convicted and sentenced to the
electric chair.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Susan has become shellshocked and walks around in a stupor.
She is being treated by a child psychologist, Dr. Caroline Canford
(Nancy Davis), who is trying to get the child to play pretend games in
order to remember what happened that night so that she can clear her
psychic blockage and return to her normal self.</P>
<P>Dell, fearful that Susan will regain her memory, unsuccessfully tries to
poison her, then drown her while she sleeps in a specially prepared
water bed in the hospital used to cure her nightmares, and when that
attempt also fails, she becomes her legal guardian and removes her from
the hospital. But when dropped off at Dell's fancy Connecticut home by
Dr. Canford, Susan sees her shadow on the wall and once again screams.</P>
<P>This villain role is out of character for the always sweet Ann Sothern,
but she shows great agility in handling the difficult role. The
melodramatic script was often not believable and the action part of the
story looked like pretend acting, just like the therapy Nancy Davis was
applying to Gigi. But the stars pulled this one together and made the
tense story, revolving around the little girl, seem plausible. Gigi
Perreau was marvelous, giving a convincing performance as a little girl
who could be both adorable and then almost frightened out of her mind.</P>
