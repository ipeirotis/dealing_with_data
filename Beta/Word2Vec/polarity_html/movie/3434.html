<P>     Violence comes in many shapes, sizes, and forms.  Twenty-six years
ago, when Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH was first released, it caused a
stir because of its gritty, uncompromising style. The deaths in this film
are neither sterile nor heroic.  When a gun is fired, the result is
inevitably messy.  In many ways, especially in its determination not to
glorify bloodshed, THE WILD BUNCH shares key themes with Clint Eastwood's
UNFORGIVEN--only this film came twenty-three years earlier.  A classic
in its original theatrical cut, THE WILD BUNCH is nevertheless improved
with eleven minutes of footage restored.</P>
<P>     The movie opens during 1913 in the small south Texas town of San
Rafael.  The Wild Bunch--a gang of six--have moved in to pull off a
robbery.  What they don't know is that it's a setup--the sacks of money
are filled with washers and there are dozens of gun-toting bounty hunters
hidden in ambush.  Things turn bloody and numerous innocent citizens are
caught in the crossfire.  The gang escapes with the bounty hunters hot on
their trail.</P>
<P>     Leading the Wild Bunch is Pike (William Holden), an aging outlaw who
enjoys planning his capers as much as carrying them out.  He's beginning
to feel his age, however--an old wound makes it nearly impossible for
him to mount his horse and he wonders how many more jobs he'll be good
for.  Pike's right-hand man is Dutch (Ernest Borgnine), another grizzled
veteran of the robbery circuit.  The gang is rounded out by Sykes (Edmond
O'Brien), Angel (Jaime Sanchez), and the Gorch Brothers (Warren Oates and
Ben Johnson).  One member of the Bunch is missing, however.  Thornton
(Robert Ryan), once Pike's closest friend, was arrested as a result of a
past screw-up, and now commands the mercenaries hunting his old buddies.</P>
<P>     It's possible to view THE WILD BUNCH as a straight action picture,
albeit a highly stylized one--Peckinpah's use of multiple angles and
quick cuts is amazing.  All the traditional elements of the genre are
present:  shoot-outs, male bonding, and a high body count.  The
director's methods of orchestrating tension are such that the movie has
its fair share of edge-of-the-seat moments.  But there's a lot more here.
THE WILD BUNCH has level upon level of complexity even beyond the obvious
metaphor of Vietnam, and has been structured to satisfy the more
discriminating movie-goer.</P>
<P>     Loyalty is certainly one theme.  For all the internal strife within
the Bunch, the bonds that tie them together are far more powerful than
those which seek to break them apart.  Betrayal of any sort is
unthinkable, which gives added resonance to the dynamics between Pike and
Thornton.  Once companions, now enemies, only death can free one from the
other.  Oaths are important because they cement loyalty.  One line,
spoken by Pike, summarizes the film's viewpoint:  "When you side with a
man, you stay with him."</P>
<P>     More striking than THE WILD BUNCH's consideration of loyalty is the
way the movie relates children to the violence surrounding them.
Peckinpah populates his film with many young faces, most of whom have no
lines.  Through every scene of slaughter, they are there, cringing
fearfully out of the way, eyes glued to the carnage, their souls slowly
corrupted.  With sadistic glee, they pit red ants against scorpions, then
set fire to all the combatants.  Aging men, weary of the violence of
life, see children as innocents--"We all dream of being a child, even
the worst of us.  Perhaps the worst of us most of all."--but they don't
see that hardships leave their mark early.  In THE WILD BUNCH, there are
always children watching, until the very end, when one does much more.
This transition from observer to participant drives home Peckinpah's
message.</P>
<P>     For anyone who doubts the importance of THE WILD BUNCH, this new
version is recommended viewing--an opportunity to witness a style that
has influenced film makers from Scorsese to Tarantino.  Not only does THE
WILD BUNCH illustrate Peckinpah's mastery of his medium, but it presents
a story that is effective on nearly every level:  the emotional, the
visual, and the visceral.  There aren't many epic motion pictures of this
scope these days, so it's a rare treat to look back more than two decades
and see something on the big screen that is as potent and relevant today
as when it was first released.</P>
