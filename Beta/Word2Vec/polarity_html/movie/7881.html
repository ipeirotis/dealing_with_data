<P>     IRMA VEP, Olivier Assayas' incisive and entertaining 1996 feature, 
takes an offbeat look at the current state of French cinema.  Cut from 
the same cloth as such recent American features as MY LIFE'S IN 
TURNAROUND and LIVING IN OBLIVION, Assayas turns the camera on the 
behind-the-scenes process, and the results are both comic and revealing 
(although it should be noted that this film is not as openly jokey as 
the other two movies).  In a picture that has a lot to say about the 
film making process and the people who engage in it, Assayas has not 
restricted his commentary to the French movie industry -- he has words 
for the American and Hong Kong brands, as well.</P>
<P>     IRMA VEP isn't lacking when it comes to a drawing card.  The sight 
of actress Maggie Cheung (SUPERCOP) garbed in a skintight, black latex 
outfit should be enough to create lines at the box office (it won't, but 
that's beside the point).  Cheung is playing herself here -- a 
successful Hong Kong actress who has been pegged by an aging French 
director, Rene Vidal (Jean-Pierre Leaud), to play the part of Irma Vep 
in his remake of Louis Feuillade's 1915 silent serial, LES VAMPIRES.  
Vidal's vision is to have Cheung dressed like Michelle Pfeiffer in 
BATMAN RETURNS, slinking around the Paris underworld.  And, out of some 
misplaced artistic sentiment, he has decided to honor the original by 
filming the new version as a silent, black-and-white offering that's 
more strange than it is compelling.  </P>
<P>     Re-arrange the letters in the name "Irma Vep" and you get 
"vampire."  However, LES VAMPIRES, like Vidal's remake, has nothing to 
do with the creatures of the night that Bram Stoker wrote about in his 
classic DRACULA.  The vampires here are a group of expert thieves, who 
spend their nights creeping through the streets of Paris, stealing what 
they can, where they can.  </P>
<P>     When it comes to Vidal's version, there are problems.  The first is 
that Maggie doesn't understand French, and no one in the crew knows 
Chinese, so all communication takes place English.  Vidal, who is trying 
a comeback after his once-promising career has hit rock bottom, spends a 
great deal of time muttering unintelligibly about his artistic 
viewpoint.  Once, in a fit of pique, he declares of the fetishist film, 
"It's not a game -- it's very important."  The costume designer, Zoe 
(Nathalie Richard), has developed a crush on Maggie, and is trying to 
surreptitiously find a way to get her into bed.  Meanwhile, in an 
attempt to get into character, Maggie dons the catsuit in real life and 
tries her hand at an actual burglary.</P>
<P>     IRMA VEP works extraordinarily well on two levels.  It explores the 
movie-making process, and, in doing so, exposes the fakery and hypocrisy 
that often emerges in the self-serving, so-called "intellectual cinema."  
One character states that many French movies have become boring because 
they're intended only for the elite, and that the tendency of French 
directors to embrace such limited projects is contributing to the death 
of the movie industry.  It's an interesting theory, and one that stands 
in contrast to the belief that big-budget, mindless action films are 
responsible for the decline in the quality of American movies (another 
subject that does not go unnoticed by IRMA VEP).  Assayas has fun with 
this idea, and gets quite a bit of mileage playing off the commonly-held 
perception that French cinema is dull and talky.  There's also a more 
serious point to this aspect of the movie, as it will prod viewers into 
considering what they look for and appreciate in a film, and whether the 
true strength of the medium lies in its variety and versatility.</P>
<P>     What really makes this project work, however, is its ability to 
create a believable group of characters.  Assayas uses the tricks of 
cinema verite -- handheld shots and long takes -- to good effect, as we 
immediately become involved in the lives of these people.  Maggie is our 
often-bewildered but always good-humored guide through this strange 
land, and we become attached to her almost from the beginning.  The 
other characters grow on us as Assayas lets us peek into their lives, 
hearing their private conversations and learning their secret desires.  </P>
<P>     The crowning sequence of the film has Maggie, in costume, slinking 
through the corridors of her hotel, intent upon a theft (although it's 
difficult for her to be stealthy when her costume makes a squishing 
sound every time she moves).  She sneaks into a room, watches from the 
shadows as a naked woman (Atom Egoyan's wife and frequent leading lady, 
Arsinee Khanjian) argues over the phone with her boyfriend, then takes a 
necklace.  Moments later, she's on the roof, in the pouring rain, bathed 
in a soft, yellow light.  It's a magical moment.</P>
<P>     Are French films stuffy?  At times, yes, and that's one of many 
reasons why even the most "accessible" French movies are relegated to 
art cinemas in this country.  IRMA VEP gleefully defies such facile 
labeling, however.  This is a sly, sexy endeavor that presents its 
audacious viewpoint with style and intelligence.  IRMA VEP features some 
wonderful performances (notably those of Cheung, Leaud, and Richard), 
that, in concert with its sure direction and smart script, make for a 
wholly satisfying motion picture.  </P>
