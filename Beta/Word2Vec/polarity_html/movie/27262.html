<P>     As the title character in THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT, Woody Harrelson
says at one point (and I paraphrase), "If the First Amendment protects a
scumbag like me, then it will protect anybody." That's the approximate
thematic gist playwright Doug Wright is going for in QUILLS: an
exploration of the idea that even free speech at its most extreme and
offensive should still be free. It's a worthy enough idea to espouse, and
the movie based on Wright's QUILLS should have been plenty worthy as well
-- if only it weren't so damned self-congratulatory about its position. As
splendidly staged as Philip Kaufman's cinematic version of QUILLS may be,
it's ultimately stunted by a text so concerned with making its artistic
points that it flops as simple story-telling.</P>
<P>     QUILLS takes us to Paris during the reign of Napoleon, where street
vendors are selling scandalous, sexually explicit novels attributed to
"Anonymous." Of course, everyone knows they are the work of the Marquis de
Sade (Geoffrey Rush), even though he is currently an inmate of Charenton
Asylum under the kindly supervision of a priest, the Abbe Coulmier
(Joaquin Phoenix). He has been smuggling out his work with the help of a
laundress named Madeleine (Kate Winslet), arousing the ire of Napoleon
himself. The emperor sends Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine), noted
alienist, to clean up matters at Charenton. But the not-so-good doctor
finds that silencing de Sade will be no easy matter, as the prolific
nobleman is practically compelled to spill his obscene thoughts onto
paper.</P>
<P>     Thus begins an all-around celebration of the purgative powers of
porn. The Marquis, we are told, has been so tainted by the world around
him that he must spill "the toxins in his head" into his stories;
Madeleine, who revels in his naughty work, tells Coulmier, "If I wasn't
such a bad woman on the page, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman
in life." QUILLS offers a dozen different defenses of free speech at its
most unfettered, including commentary that we must know vice in order to
appreciate virtue, and a taunt from the Marquis to the Abbe: "Are your
convictions so fragile that they cannot stand in opposition to mine?"
Every five minutes or so, there's another re-phrasing of the same point in
a slightly different way: Art is just art, words are just words, and even
the most ghastly art and the most ghastly words must be given their table
in the marketplace of ideas.</P>
<P>     A debatable point, to be certain, but the problem isn't so much
whether or not one concurs with Wright's absolutist interpretation of
freedom of speech. The problem with QUILLS is that Wright is so intent on
hammering his point home that he ignores little matters like fleshing out
his characters. Winslet and Phoenix are effective as the essentially good
people aware of their darker impulses, but Wright is mostly interested in
them as representations of the dark impulses in all of us. Michael Caine
plays one narrow-eyed note as the hypocritical man of morality who,
naturally, is sexually cruel to his own young wife (Amelia Warner) and
leeches funds from de Sade's wife to help finish his opulent home. And
Rush, while thoroughly entertaining as the ultimate libertine, never gets
at what de Sade was ultimately all about as a human being. Once you've
figured out what Wright is saying in QUILLS -- and it doesn't take all
that long -- the playing out of the narrative feels like a long walk
around in circles.</P>
<P>     Wright does deserve credit for not taking the easiest ways out with
his arguments. He shows de Sade's work provoking a group of madmen to
violent acts, and he doesn't soft-pedal the cruel, petulant de Sade
himself as a torture artist just to make him more sympathetic as a
tortured artist. There are several individually enjoyable scenes in
QUILLS, from the "telephone game" rendering of one of de Sade's tales to
the staging of a bawdy play intended to humiliate Royer-Collard.
Physically, it's a lovely production to behold. Emotionally, it is
provocative stuff. But intellectually, it's redundant. It's clear that
Wright believes even the kind of art that could inspire a Columbine
massacre must not be suppressed. It's equally clear that he feels pretty
good about himself for saying so. Ironically, QUILLS probably works best
as simple, sensual, prurient-interest entertainment. As a presentation of
ideas, it's more thesis than theater.</P>
