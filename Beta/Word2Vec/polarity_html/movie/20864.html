<PRE> Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a Dogma 95 styled film, where the Danish filmmaker's group
manifesto determines the rules for how the film is to be made. The idea
is to give their films a fresh look and for them to provide the
unexpected, and to catch on film the complete truth from its characters
and their situations. This film was shot with a small video camera (a
Sony PC7) that fits in the palm of your hand, then it is transferred to
the prescribed Dogma 35-millimeter format. I suppose it is fair to
assume that one of the reasons that this manifesto was drawn up in 1995
by four Danish filmmakers--Christian Levring, Soren Kragh-Jacobsen,
Thomas Vinterberg, and Lars von Trier-- was to give them publicity and
challenge the film community to create innovative films. So far the only
two films I saw from this group, von Trier's The Idiots & BREAKING THE
WAVES, have been  challenging and impressive films.</P>
<P>For those interested in what their Dogma document actually states, I
give you the following example:</P>
<PRE>           "1. Shooting must be done on location. Props and sets must not
           be brought in. (If a particular prop is necessary for the story, a
           location must be chosen where this prop is to be found.)</PRE>
<PRE>           "2. The sound must never be produced apart from the image or
           vice versa. (Music must not be used unless it occurs where the
           scene is being shot.)</PRE>
<PRE>           "3. The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or
           immobility attainable in the hand is permitted. (The film must
           not take place where the camera is standing; shooting must take
           place where the film takes place.) "4. The film must be in
           color. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little
           light for exposure, the scene must be cut or a single lamp
           [must] be attached to the camera.)</PRE>
<PRE>           "5. Optical work and filters are forbidden.</PRE>
<PRE>           "6. The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders,
           weapons, etc. must not occur.)</PRE>
<PRE>           "7. Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That</PRE>
<PRE>           is to say that the film takes place here and now.)</PRE>
<PRE>           "8. Genre movies are not acceptable.</PRE>
<PRE>           "9. The film format must be Academy 35 mm.</PRE>
<PRE>           "10. The director must not be credited.</PRE>
<PRE>           "Furthermore, I swear as a director to refrain from personal
           taste! I am no longer an artist. I swear to refrain from creating a
           'work,' as I regard the instant as more important than the whole.
           My supreme goal is to force the truth out of my characters and
           settings. I swear to do so by all the means available and at the
           cost of any good taste and any aesthetic considerations."</PRE>
<P>Rules like that rub me the wrong way. What I ask from a film, is for it
to be imaginative and well-made, and I don't particularly care how the
filmmaker accomplishes that.</P>
<P>Henning Moritzen is Helge (played with a restraint and a certain
brilliance, not allowing himself to become a stereotypical villain).
Helge, a prosperous patriarch, is celebrating his sixtieth birthday by
having his family and friends come to his country-estate hotel for his
bourgeois birthday party, complete with a hired toastmaster (Bondam) to
keep things looking well-organized and professional. The celebration
will turn into a feast of dark family secrets revealed "bombshell style"
in front of all the guests and hotel staff, while everyone tries to
catch their breath and figure out how to act.</P>
<P>It would be impossible to go into the minute details of the film without
immeasurably spoiling it for the viewer who hasn't seen the film. My
pleasure in seeing it was that I was caught completely unaware of what
was to occur and that shock kept me absorbed in the story, not quite
knowing what to expect next. This might be the secret reason why the
film worked so well, as I was made to feel like one of the guests in
this theatrical film.</P>
<P>The psychically crippled children and their estranged relationship with
their father is the key to the story. Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) is the
eldest son, brooding that his twin sister, Linda, has within the year
taken her life in her bathtub. He missed her funeral, which was the last
family gathering and hasn't seen anyone in the family for quite a while,
living in Paris, even owning a few restaurants there. But Christian's
mission for coming to this party has a definite purpose, it is to let
his father know what has been on his mind ever since childhood. He will
be able to accomplish this mission with the help of the hotel staff who
keep the guests from leaving by stealing their car keys, and with the
needed personal aid of the chef (Bjarne), his childhood friend, who will
see to it that he gets a chance to get his message across. He will also
get solace from the pretty waitress Pia (Trine), who is in love with
this troubled soul. Then there is the youngest in the family, Michael
(Thomas Bo Larsen), Christian's volatile brother whom the family is
ashamed of because of his crudeness and instability, who is married to a
vulgar woman (Helle Dolleris), whom he treats like a dog. But, at least,
he is the only one of the children to provide his father with three
grandchildren. Helene (Paprika Steen) is the flighty sister who studied
anthropology and now wants to be a singer, suffering from depression,
who brings an American black man (Gbatokai) to the celebration, which
will culminate in the families' racist feelings coming out in the open.
All the children are disappointments to the incestuous father. Their
mother (Birthe) acts as the father's voice of reason in all the family
matters, trying to soothe out the wrinkles in their life by turning a
blind eye to what she sees, until even she can't look away any more.</P>
<P>The result of the film was exhilerating, Dogma or not, it is a work that
is scathing, penetrating layers of deceit and festering wounds that
cannot be healed. The guests were  left confused by all the startling
revelations they were privy to, some wanting to just leave but couldn't,
some trying to decide if what they were hearing was true or not but
amazingly taking it all in stride, as if they were shock-proof. But the
cruel truth and tenseness rule the weekend, even when all the
disturbances are deftly handled by the  toastmaster who tried to keep
the traditional birthday party afloat with good cheer and dance and
games. But it was to no avail.</P>
<P>To point out how the guests weren't quite sure of anything that was
happening there, they are shown eating lobster, or salmon, or tomato
soup, each one unsure of what they were served.</P>
<P>The Celebration is indeed a celebration not to be forgotten soon. It
drains the emotions, somehow satisfies the intellect, and challenges the
conventions of the usual fare of sophisticated family drama. I felt like
I was serving as a witness for this dysfunctional family, asked to judge
the family head as he is forced into finding out who he really is.
Vinterberg declares how the impact of Helge's revelation affected
everyone in the immediate family, and how that acted as a cleansing for
the tribe, something that was essential for their psyches. At least,
they now have some kind of a shot of pulling themselves together, even
though the film does not show any of them changing internally. They are
still their old selves (good and bad) after the revelations come out,
but only this time they are all on the right side and are more armed
with information about what went on as they were growing up. And how the
film accomplished this, was through good storytelling, where one doesn't
need any false constraints, something that is reminiscent of Greek
tragedy or Shakespearean drama.</P>
