<PRE>                                  QUIZ SHOW
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  John Turturro, Rob Morrow, Ralph Fiennes, David Paymer,
           Paul Scofield, Hank Azaria.
Screenplay:  Paul Attanasio.
Director:  Robert Redford.</P>
<P>     There is a certain irony to the involvement of Robert Redford in
the making of QUIZ SHOW.  Much like QUIZ SHOW's anti-hero Charles Van
Doren, Redford became a star based on nothing so much as his golden boy
good looks and charm.  There is perhaps even more irony in the selling
of QUIZ SHOW as a story about a loss of American innocence, since it
may be the ultimate debunking of the myth of the Eisenhower-era
American dream.  Brilliantly written and directed, it is a tale of how
television sold us what we wanted to believe about our country, and a
frighteningly contemporary examination of the cult of image.</P>
<P>     QUIZ SHOW opens in 1958, when prime time game shows like
"Twenty-One" were ruling the airwaves.  Herbert Stempel (John Turturro)
is the reigning champion, but only because the show is rigged to keep
the winners winning.  When Stempel's ratings wane, producer Dan Enright
(David Paymer) has him take a dive, and brings in Charles Van Doren
(Ralph Fiennes) to replace him.  Van Doren, an attractive upper-class
intellectual, becomes a national sensation; Stempel, meanwhile, becomes
bitter over his ouster from the champion's throne.  When Congressional
investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) begins looking into the quiz
shows, Stempel tells all, leading to a series of Congressional
hearings.</P>
<P>     QUIZ SHOW opens with a visually arresting sequence which perfectly
establishes the foundation for Redford and screenwriter Paul
Attanasio.  In a series of dream-like dissolves, Goodwin looks over a
beautiful new Chrysler he knows he can't afford, while the salesman
makes his pitch.  Here he becomes a stand-in for everyone who was duped
by "Twenty-One," wanting too much to believe the fantasy.  As he
conducts his investigation, Goodwin befriends Van Doren, and begins to
travel in Van Doren's privileged world, revelling in his assimilation
until his wife accuses him of being "the Jewish Uncle Tom."  What
Goodwin learns, as the head of "Twenty-One" sponsor Geritol (slyly
portrayed by Martin Scorsese) explains, is that the viewers "watch to
see the money."  It's all about the dream, a dream of equal opportunity
that doesn't exist on the quiz show's carefully controlled,
demographically attractive selection of champions.  Morrow's subtle
performance as Goodwin shows how even a man who was "first in his class
at Harvard" (as he constantly reminds everyone) could be taken in.</P>
<P>     Morrow's is just one of a half-dozen performances in QUIZ SHOW
which will draw Academy Award consideration.  John Turturro turns in a
savage portrayal of Herbie Stempel, a life-long social outcast who sees
his removal from the spotlight as a personal betrayal, yet still finds
himself caught up in Van Doren's fall from grace.  Ralph Fiennes'
enigmatic Van Doren could have been flat and passive, but he becomes a
sheltered and overgrown child in Fiennes' capable hands, desperate for
approval and a fame independent from his literary family.  Veteran
actor Paul Scofield is dynamic as Mark Van Doren, whose mere commanding
presence does as much to explain the younger Van Doren's motivations as
Fiennes' performance; their scenes together are spectacular.  David
Paymer is also noteworthy as the slick and savvy Enright.  Only Hank
Azaria, as Enright's too- dense-for-words assistant, comes off a bit
overplayed.</P>
<P>     For my money, however, the true star of QUIZ SHOW is Paul
Attanasio, whose screenplay is certainly the finest of the year.  Every
characterization is full and rounded; every scene is a perfect
development of theme.  The dialogue is filled with crisp, subtle and
quotable lines.  In one perfect moment, Charles Van Doren's indignant
insistence to Enright that "I am a professor at Columbia," is followed
by a studio gopher who announces, "The professor's needed in makeup."
It's a brilliant encapsulation of how Van Doren had been taken over by
his own image, emphasized later in a masterful scene at his
Congressional testimony.  QUIZ SHOW is yet another example of what is
possible when a script is this good, the direction is perfectly
complementary, and the acting is first-rate.  The film to beat as
1994's best picture has arrived.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 points:  10.</PRE>
