<P>     By the end of Nick Broomfield's controversy-plagued documentary KURT
& COURTNEY, I think I knew as much about Broomfield himself as I knew
about Kurt Cobain or Courtney Love.  The film might have begun as a
biographical study, exploring the tempestuous tives of Nirvana lead singer
Cobain and riot grrrl-cum-actress Love both before and after their 1992
marriage, but that's not the story it ends up telling.  Instead, it
becomes the tale of Broomfield's ongoing battle with Love over the making
of the film -- her successful efforts to persuade MTV to withdraw funding,
her objection to the use of several songs, her attempts to intimidate
anyone involved in the production.</P>
<P>     No one can blame Broomfield for being infuriated at Love,
particularly when her 11th-hour legal stunt forced KURT & COURTNEY out of
the Sundance Film Festival lineup.  It might have been easier to
sympathize with him, however, if his presence in the film weren't so
consistently intrusive.  Like Michael Moore, Broomfield has no qualms
about filming himself in the process of making his documentary film;
unlike Moore, Broomfield isn't entertaining enough to warrant all the
screen time.  In fact, he's just plain annoying at times, interjecting
commentary over virtually every musical selection (or lack thereof) and
casually referring to Cobain's hometown of Aberdeen, Washington as a
"redneck logging town."  Even his habit of shooting from inside the car as
it pulls up to various locations feels pretentious, an attempt at
you-are-there urgency which conveniently ignores that automotive jaunts
hardly make for compelling cinema.</P>
<P>     Lucky for Broomfield that his subject is such a wild and provocative
one.  KURT & COURTNEY features as wonderfully twisted a cast of characters
as any recent film has compiled:  Love's estranged father Hank Harrison,
whose casual aggression towards his daughter provides a frightening
insight into her childhood; Love's ex-boyfriend and former Portland-area
singer Rozz Rezabek, seething bitterness at the career he might have had
if Courtney hadn't driven him to hate it; a one-time friend of Love and
Cobain named Amy who may or may not have photos of them doing heroin
together, but certainly is trying way too hard to look like Courtney.
Broomfield also spends time examining rumors that Cobain's 1994 death,
ruled a shotgun suicide, was actually a murder engineered by Love.  This
angle introduces us to El Duce, a demented, drunken punk band frontman who
claims Love once offered him "50 grant to whack Kurt Cobain."  Watching
the kind of people with whom Kurt and Courtney surrounded themselves makes
you wonder why both of them didn't end up dead long before.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, KURT & COURTNEY doesn't seem out to convict Courtney Love
of soliciting murder, debunking many of the contentions of conspiracy
theorists like private detective Tom Grant.  It's far more damning in its
contention that Love's drive for fame and success tends to crush
everything in its path, and that her history of verbal and physical
assaults is just a hair's breadth removed from her obsessive need to
control her public image.  It would have been chilling to watch that
personality connected more directly to Cobain's psychological
disintegration, but the troubled soul has little more than a cameo role in
the film.  Instead, Courtney is primarily connected to Nick Broomfield,
who finally follows Love on-stage at an ACLU benefit to chastise her
hypocrisy.  KURT & COURTNEY tends to drift away from its potentially
fascinating subject; it's a record of celebrity turned caustic, intercut
with a record of a film-maker's pique.  You almost wonder why he didn't
call the film KURT & COURTNEY & NICK.</P>
