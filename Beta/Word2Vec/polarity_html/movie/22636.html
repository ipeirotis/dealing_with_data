<P>The film "Magnolia" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie
poster suggests. The dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the
petals on the flower. They all come from the same stem and as the flower begins
to develop they grow farther and farther apart. The numerous characters in the
film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one
another socially. From a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host,
each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain. They are each
seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness. Whether
this companion is a distant family member or a spouse, each character begs for
one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one. </P>
<P>"Magnolia" is a clever, well thought out film from prodigy director-writer Paul
Thomas Anderson of "Boogie Nights" fame. The detailed character analyses and
the powerful script make "Magnolia" memorable.  However, what really is
impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several
unrelated stories, the film is never confusing. Anderson's control over
transitioning from one story to another story is masterful. He also knows
exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of "Magnolia's" scenes
drag on too long. Any three hour film that does not deliver even one
uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending. From the fascinating
beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't
get boring.  It is obvious that Anderson put a lot of time into connecting each
subplot. This is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation. Every
character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees. For
example, cop John C. Reilly is connected to game show host Phillip Baker Hall
through Hall's daughter Melora Walters who once went on a date with Reilly. The
fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows
that there are universal pains that all classes, races, and genders suffer.
Anderson's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing. The
only mistake Anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making
his actors all sing an Aimee Mann song simultaneously. This was foolish not
only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it
had a Broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from
your typical Broadway musical than you can get.</P>
<P>The performances in "Magnolia" are perfection. This is a classic example of
flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting. Anderson allows many of
Hollywood's best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best, character
acting. All of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are
able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen
then most movie stars can do in a feature length film. Worth noting is Tom
Cruise, who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny
but depressing tour de force performance. He was probably noticed more than the
other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much
different and impressive than those in the past (however any actor in this film
could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints) The only
problem I had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously
edited down such as Melinda Dillon's character as Phillip Baker Hall's wife.
She seemed to be thrown in towards the end and I felt very little sympathy for
her because I had not seen her enough earlier in the film.</P>
<P>"Magnolia" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters.
Anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous
people in only a few hours. To see that Anderson is able to perfectly portray
this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of
diversity. Diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of
time. I predict a lot of diversity and success from Anderson in the future.</P>
