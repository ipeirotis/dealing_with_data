<P>     Reviewing a Jackie Chan film is a lot like reviewing a James Bond 
film – it's necessary to take the movie in the spirit it was intended, 
which means that, while familiar motion picture elements like plot and 
character development are necessary ingredients, they are not focal 
points.  In fact, judging any Jackie Chan movie by stodgy and 
traditional criteria would result in a rather lackluster result.  
Fortunately, there are enough other elements (comedy and action in 
particular) to more than offset the uninspired storyline.  Even at his 
worst, which MR. NICE GUY definitely isn't, Chan is fun to watch.</P>
<P>     Ever since New Line Cinema released RUMBLE IN THE BRONX three years 
ago, Chan's popularity in the United States has been on the rise.  
RUMBLE was quickly followed by American theatrical rollouts of FIRST 
STRIKE, SUPERCOP, and OPERATION CONDOR.  Currently, Chan's first major 
Hollywood feature, RUSH HOUR, is in production.  Meanwhile, the 
changeover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese hands has done nothing 
to dampen Chan's popularity in Asia, where he remains the biggest star 
in the firmament.</P>
<P>     MR. NICE GUY represents the next step in Chan's global conquest – 
his first all English-language picture.  Originally slated to be filmed 
in New York City, the location was changed to Melbourne for financial 
and logistical reasons.  The cast is comprised largely of non-Asian 
actors, including Western martial arts star Richard Norton, with whom 
Chan has worked twice before (TWINKLE TWINKLE LUCKY STARS, CITY HUNTER).  
The director, Samo Hung, has a long history with Chan, having directed 
him in seven previous pictures.  In addition to taking the helm, Hung 
makes an appearance in front of the camera in a small-but-pivotal comic 
role as a cyclist who gets pushed too far.</P>
<P>     As a change of pace, Chan doesn't play a policeman or secret agent 
this time.  Instead, he's a popular TV chef named Jackie.  Although 
fighting bad guys isn't his thing, he can't resist a damsel in distress, 
and, when a redheaded TV reporter, Diane (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick), is in 
need of help, Jackie's assistance causes him to be unwittingly pulled 
into a crime war that features drug dealers on one side and gang members 
on the other.  Meanwhile, there's the matter of an incriminating video 
tape that Jackie has which everyone wants.  To get it, they're willing 
to go to any lengths, including kidnapping Jackie's girlfriend, Miki 
(Miki Lee), breaking into his house, and terrorizing him at a public 
appearance.</P>
<P>     There's more action and comedy in MR. NICE GUY than in the last few 
Chan films.  Perhaps thankfully, considering how convoluted some of the 
storylines are, there's also less emphasis upon plot.  This allows us to 
concentrate upon Chan's spell without being distracted by implausible 
and unnecessary narrative details.  MR. NICE GUY gives us the basics:  
Chan at his action/comedy best, a bad guy (Norton) who enjoys chewing on 
the scenery, and three attractive women (Lee, Karen McLymont, and 
Fitzpatrick).  Throw in about a half-dozen high energy martial arts 
fights, several impressive action/chase sequences, and a spectacular 
finale, and the recipe is complete.  Who cares that there are some 
sizable storyline gaps or that one character, Diane, virtually 
disappears (without explanation) two-thirds of the way through the film?</P>
<P>     MR. NICE GUY contains its share of memorable moments.  The most 
dynamic of these involves Chan's attempts to avoid, then corral, a 120-
ton mining vehicle which is subsequently used to wreak mass havoc 
(including trashing a $1.5 million house).  There's also a fun chase 
with a runaway horse-and-carriage careening down Melbourne's Swanston 
Street.  Finally, there's an amazing fight sequence that features Chan 
having close encounters with some power tools, including two circular 
saws.  And for those who like unusual product placements, Pepsi gets 
one.</P>
<P>     As usual, however, the centerpiece of MR. NICE GUY isn't all of the 
expertly-choreographed action sequences, but Chan himself.  Unrestrained 
and charismatic, the international celebrity manages not only to smile 
his way through most of the film, but to cause audience members to do 
the same.  The action is never too violent, and it's always tinged with 
comedy.  Chan, whose mannerisms recall those of Buster Keaton and 
Charlie Chaplin, pays tribute to the silent comics in a hilarious scene 
that involves a bunch of opening and closing blue doors.  With its blend 
of crowd-pleasing elements, MR. NICE GUY is irrepressible fun.</P>
