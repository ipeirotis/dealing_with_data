<P>     On March 13, 1996, the self-effacing Polish film maker, Krzysztof=20
Kieslowski, died of heart failure in a Warsaw hospital.  The film world=20
mourned, especially when it was revealed that Kieslowski, who had been=20
retired since the completion of RED in 1994, was contemplating a return=20
to work with a new trilogy of films about heaven, hell, and limbo.  What=20
we are left with in the wake of the director's passing, however is an=20
extraordinary r=E9sum=E9 that includes such memorable features as CAMERA=20
BUFF, DECALOGUE, THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE, and the THREE COLORS=20
trilogy (BLUE, WHITE, RED).  Less than a year before his death,=20
Kieslowski agreed to be the subject of a short documentary by his long-
time assistant, Krzysztof Wierzbicki.  The hour long film, which was=20
made for Danish television, featured Kieslowski's recollections of his=20
life and movies, along with several candid shots of the director=20
relaxing and enjoying his retirement.  What was initially intended as a=20
fairly inconsequential interview unwittingly turned into a remarkable=20
tribute. =20</P>
<P>     Does I'M SO-SO offer any new insights into the director's psyche? =20
It does, even for those who have poured over his autobiography,=20
KIESLOWSKI ON KIESLOWSKI.  During the course of one hour, there's hardly=20
any topic that goes untouched by Kieslowski, which speaks highly not=20
only of the subject of the film, but of the interviewer, Wierzbicki. =20
Kieslowski has always shunned the spotlight (preferring to "sit in a=20
dark room and smoke"), so it's a credit to this film's director that he=20
was able to present such a candid and moving portrait.</P>
<P>     Kieslowski confesses that because he knows Wierzbicki (as well=20
several other men in the crew), "We can discuss=85 meaningful and personal=
=20
topics."  He goes on to talk about, in some detail, his philosophy of=20
documentary film making.  After saying that he made documentaries --=20
movies about "people who lead real lives" -- to describe the world that=20
we live in, Kieslowski goes on to reveal a series of stringent=20
guidelines that he followed.  For example, he believes that everyone is=20
entitled to their privacy and certain things should not be photographed=20
for the screen.  "Can you film a real death and use it as a=20
documentary?"  he asks.  It's meant to be a redundant question.=20</P>
<P>     Admitting that he turned the camera on himself in every picture=20
that he made (like the protagonist in CAMERA BUFF at the movie's end),=20
Kieslowski never saw himself as anything more than a film director with=20
a bleak view of the world.  "I have only one good characteristic.  I'm a=20
pessimist=85 The future is a black hole."  He also doesn't claim to have=20
the answers to the questions posed by his films, saying that "Knowing is=20
not my business, not knowing is."  And he indicates that he believes all=20
interpretations of his films to be valid, stating that he made movies so=20
that everyone could take something different from them.</P>
<P>     I'M SO-SO presents a broad overview of Kieslowski's career, zeroing=20
in on a few select films for more in-depth discussion.  These are: =20
1980's TALKING HEADS ("an experiment"), 1976's THE CALM, 1979's CAMERA=20
BUFF ("the film shows the camera's power"), 1981's BLIND CHANCE, 1988's=20
DECALOGUE ("we wanted to brush up those 10 well-written sentences"), and=20
1994's RED.  At one point, Kieslowski also reveals that he once met an=20
Italian man who had experienced something very similar to the story=20
presented in THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE.</P>
<P>     The title comes from Kieslowski's belief that people should not lie=20
about how they're feeling just for the sake of polite conversation.  As=20
a result, when someone asks him how he's doing, instead of replying=20
"Well" or "Very well", he says "I'm so-so."  In truth, however, there's=20
nothing "so-so" about this particular motion picture.  KRZYSZTOF=20
KIESLOWSKI: I'M SO-SO is a striking picture of an extraordinary man who=20
made some of the most powerful films of the last two decades.  This=20
movie will live alongside the director's body of work as an important=20
and informative companion piece.</P>
