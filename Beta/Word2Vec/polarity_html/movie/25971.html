<PRE>HOLLOW MAN (2000)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Paul Verhoeven</PRE>
<P>Screenplay: Andrew W. Marlowe, Gary Scott Thompson</P>
<P>Starring: Kevin Bacon, Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, William Devane, Greg 
Grunberg, Joey Slotnick, Mary Jo Randle, Steve Altes, Rhona Mitra</P>
<P>Paul Verhoeven, the Dutch auteur who dragged his violent, sexually aggressive 
aesthetic into American film, has never been what I'd consider a thoughtful 
director (though some of his films, notably STARSHIP TROOPERS, have been 
lauded as artistic achievements), but he is the kind of Hollywood film maker 
who's managed to, no matter what the budget, make his films distinctive and 
even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on 
which he toils. STARSHIP TROOPERS was essentially a B-monster movie remake of 
his enthralling Dutch War film SOLDIER OF ORANGE (a great film that's nearly 
impossible to find on video, yet SHOWGIRLS is everywhere), in which he cast a 
troop of stunningly attractive mannequins; the square jawed Casper Van Dien 
and Denise Richards (who may actually be 45% silicone), in what feels like an 
American propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage. It's 
not a completely successful film, but as a 
failure it's certainly an interesting (and mostly entertaining) one.</P>
<P>My favorite Verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores; 
SPETTERS, a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the 
sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned SOLDIER OF ORANGE (haven't 
yet gotten around to seeing THE 4th MAN or TURKISH DELIGHT). I believe his 
best Hollywood film to be ROBOCOP, a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic 
hero that's as touching as Schwarzenegger's in T2. That movie was violent but 
not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent Verhoeven pics. Its 
violence seemed to be there for a purpose, namely to create an atmosphere of 
unpredictable dread, not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience. 
There's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of ROBOCOP wherein 
the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him. He tortures the officer 
by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic. It's a startling moment of 
barbaric, maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that 
could be designated as splatter punk-noir.</P>
<P>In HOLLOW MAN Kevin Bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up, 
he impales a co-worker, drowns another and so on. But why? His character is 
introduced as a smug genius, the kind who's always impeccably dressed and 
races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the 
world to hear, sort of like a scheming uber villain from DALLAS or MELROSE 
PLACE, though once the character becomes invisible, this film has him pull a 
180 shift into a psychotic movie monster. The kind who just won't die. HOLLOW 
MAN's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist Linda 
(Elizabeth Shue, acting as if she were Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm) and her 
lover, a hunk of beef scientist played by Josh Brolin who's saddled with the 
film's worst lines ("I've lost cohesion again!"). They're a typical Aaron 
Spelling couple, good-looking but as vacant as George W. Bush's Republican 
National Convention speech (i.e. Bush referring to Clinton; "…so much 
promise…but to what end? To what end?"-- this actually got applause! Suddenly 
Warren Beatty doesn't look so absurd). The rest of the film's characters are 
all well past thirty, though act like annoying high school party animals 
insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners; Is it just me 
or have labored insults become Big Budget Hollywood's new character 
developing technique? Ahh, what a cynical time we live in…</P>
<P>As the picture opens we meet Cain (Kevin Bacon), an egocentric scientist 
working with the crew of 
aforementioned irritating scientists on a Top Secret (so Top Secret the 
government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to 
perform their extensive experimentation's) project with the goal to make 
invisibility a possibility (for what purpose is never hinted at). They've 
performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary 
causing Caine, in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's Late Show origins, to 
impulsively experiment on himself. Caine neglects to let the Pentagon in on 
his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest 
of the crew will think the Pentagon gave the go ahead. Our mad scientist is 
turned invisible (after several FX-heavy complications), then he inexplicably 
(it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more 
savage creatures, but this is never explored, and if that was the case why 
the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human?) begins 
raping, assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases, always with a lame 
wisecrack ready a la Freddy Krueger.</P>
<P>It grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's Verhoeven's films 
that have become hollow. Like the rest, this one is cold, heartless, and full 
of contempt for humanity, but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of 
wit, insight and makes no statement other than "audiences will pay for 
anything these days". It's an affront to anyone looking for something 
stimulating on an intellectual level, or even those hoping to spend a 
Saturday night with a fun, thrill-a-minute ride. Verhoeven has instead served 
up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason 
to care.</P>
<P>The previews make HOLLOW MAN look like an irresistible flick. How can one not 
have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art FX to illustrate an 
invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self? A couple weeks ago, 
after seeing the trailer, a bunch of friends and I got into a long discussion 
of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible 
individual indulging in their newfound ability. HOLLOW MAN looked like the 
first film to do so and whoa, in a serious manner to boot. But oh yeah, it is 
directed by Paul Verhoven not Atom Egoyan or Peter Greenway. Verhoeven 
delivers the sleazy "goods", but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing 
manner, here it just feels icky and uncomfortable. The director keeps his 
camera trained at his nubile actresses, caressing their breasts with his lens 
all while faux-PSYCHO music strains in the background. It's plainly obvious 
that Verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism (like in the classic PEEPING TOM) 
but exploiting it and not even doing that very well. It's funny that with all 
the technology $90 million can get you Verhoven is stuck at trying to figure 
out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand.
Most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet 
another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain 
can pop up for more attacks. In fact it's largely irrelevant that Bacon is 
invisible since, by the end, most of his potential victims don infer-red 
glasses that track his body heat. As in every Mad Slasher film we get the 
killers POV (a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses 
triggered unpleasant memories of SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE), and lots of scenes 
where people are unknowingly stalked.</P>
<P>The film only provides one moment that I found genuinely creepy. It happens 
when a lab assistant (Kim Dickens, who looks like she stepped out of Playboy) 
in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible Bacon, suddenly pauses. "Are 
you looking at me?", she queries, obviously haunted. It's a little moment in 
a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a 
plot that should have run its course by 1982 (the apex of the Mad Slasher 
craze). Those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being 
as bad as URBAN LEGEND or I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. And they're 
the only reason to check out HOLLOW MAN, preferably as a mid-week bargain 
rental. You've been warned. But you probably won't listen, will you? Tis' a 
pity…</P>
