<P>        THE LASERMAN: somehow the title of writer-director-producer Peter
Wang's film conjures up images of superheroes, like UltraMan and Spiderman.
You kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot
laser beams from his fingertips.  As it turns out, THE LASERMAN _is_ about
crime and about laser beams, but there aren't any superheroes.  Instead,
Wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters
living in the ultimate cultural melting pot: New York City.  THE LASERMAN
is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity, eccentricity, and electricity.</P>
<P>        The film tells the bizarre story of Arthur Weiss (Marc Hayashi), a
Chinese-American laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after
he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment.  He loses his job
but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser
technology to commit dastardly deeds.  Arthur's professional life is
cluttered with moral dilemmas.  His personal life, on the other hand, is
cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives.  In fact, Arthur is
by far the blandest character in the film, despite a charismatic
performance by Hayashi (the San Francisco-based actor whose films include
CHAN IS MISSING and THE KARATE KID II).  It's the auxiliary characters who
give THE LASERMAN its unique spark.</P>
<P>        Arthur's not-so-typical Jewish mother, Ruth, for example, is
convinced that a Chinese Soul is trapped in her Jewish body.  She has dyed
her red hair black, she takes herbal medicine daily, and she is perpetually
cooking up strange delicacies, such as Matzo balls in soy sauce--the
ultimate fusion of Jewish and Chinese cuisine.  Veteran stage actress Joan
Copeland takes the part and runs with it, almost stealing the movie in the
process.  She plays Ruth as a driven woman, determined to overcome her
genetic heritage by immersing herself in Chinese culture.</P>
<P>        Arthur's girlfriend Janet (Maryann Urbano) is a kooky free-spirit
who would rather meditate than copulate; her ultimate goal is orgasm
through Zen meditation.  Arthur's best friend, Joey (Tony Leung), is a
small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine
guns.  Joey is married to Arthur's Jewish sister, but he is also having an
affair with a Chinese immigrant who works in a whore house.  Arthur's
11-year-old son, Jimmy, played by the amazingly adorable David Chan,
is--horror of horrors--bad at math!  He finds it impossible to meet his
father's lofty expectations.</P>
<P>        The various people in Arthur's life come together to form a rich
tapestry of humanity.  Like Wang's earlier film, A GREAT WALL (about a San
Francisco family visiting relatives in China), THE LASERMAN revolves around
cultural differences.  Every character in the film is, in some way or
another, trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance
between his native culture and the American way.</P>
<P>        The movie also offers a provocative look at technology.  Wang
appears in the movie as Lieutenant Lu, a detective who is fed up with
machines, even though he relies on them to do his job.  The film views
technology with a wary eye, acknowledging its necessity while at the same
time realizing its potential dangers.  Wang raises the time-honored
question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their
inventions.  Was Einstein responsible for the A-bomb?  Is Arthur Weiss
responsible for his lasers?  The movie pits spirituality against
technology, man against machine, and the result is a draw.  According to
the film, technology has its place, but we must employ it with great
forethought and caution.</P>
<P>        Ironically, by its very nature, THE LASERMAN is a triumph of
technology--the technology of filmmaking.  Wang's direction is exquisite,
especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically
cross-cuts between the various subplots, perhaps in homage to D.W.
Griffith.   Cinematographer Ernest Dickerson, who has worked on all of
Spike Lee's films, gives THE LASERMAN a distinctive, artistic look.  Mason
Daring's score, which includes a send-up of Bach, is right on target.</P>
<P>        THE LASERMAN is an ambitious endeavor, which is to be applauded,
but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault.  Wang serves up so many slices of
life in the film that it's hard to digest them all.  For instance, one
character (Arthur's sister) has negligible screen time, and consequently we
just don't care about her marital problems.  In weaving his web, Wang has
included a few too many strands.</P>
<P>        Overall, however, THE LASERMAN is a charmingly eclectic concoction.
On the surface, the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller,
overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style.  The heavier issues
emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film.  You can ponder the
moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in
China Town.</P>
