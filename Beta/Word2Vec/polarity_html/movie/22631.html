<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Jim Jarmusch (STRANGER THAN PARADISE/PERMANENT VACATION/ DOWN BY LAW/
MYSTERY TRAIN/NIGHT ON Earth) has directed and written a poetically
unique and disturbing Western, one that is an American masterpiece, and
is clearly one of the best films of the '90s. The electrical guitar
played and scored by Neil Young, complements the eerie mood of the film,
as Young's improvised melodic theme is repeated with different strains
and variations to it throughout. The film could also be viewed as if one
were reading a book of poems, as each scene is separated by a blackout,
which allows the next scene to be read as a new poem or viewed as a new
development in the film, one that is not necessarily related to the
previous scene.</P>
<P>The film opens with a written quote onscreen from Henri Michaux- " It is
preferable not to travel with a dead man." This sets the tone for the
film, which will take a jaundiced look at how the white man settled the
west and abusively treated the Native Americans. This film is viewed on
the side of the outsider, the loner, and the visionary, who have the
wherewithal to see through all the violence that America is built around
in its pursuit of happiness and economic comfort. Aside from Jarmusch's
deadpan humor, the dreamlike intonations, the psychedelics, and the
surreal camerawork (a beautifully shot black-and-white film by Robby
Müller slowly unfolding, that catches hold of the deathlike odyssey
sequences and the superb imagery of the landscape), but also relates a
strong history lesson and a colorful mystical tour of the death
experience that adds an especially vibrant visionary sense to this
stunning and problematical film.</P>
<P>In the late 19th century, a meek, orphaned young man, foppishly
misdressed for his journey in a checkered suit and bow tie, named
William Blake (Johnny Depp), leaves Cleveland by train with a letter
guaranteeing him a job as an accountant for the Dickinson Metal Works
out west, in a town called Machine.</P>
<P>The train ride is a trip into the hostile frontier, where the rugged
passengers will at one point open fire on a herd of buffalo going by.The
white man cruelly killed off for no reason, the Indian's natural food
supply, as they performed a form of genocide against the Native
Americans. The only civilized conversation Blake has on the train, comes
from the fireman (Crispin Glover), who is smudged with soot on his face,
telling Blake he can't read his job acceptance letter, but forewarns
him, "I wouldn't trust no words written on no piece of paper."</P>
<P>Blake's destination point, is a squalid place, with no redeeming
features or common civility about it. It is a menacingly dark and
satanic mill town that he has gone to for his economic salvation. It is
a comment on the Industrial Revolution and how it destroys people's
sensibilities and their environment, and takes away any hopes that they
might have had for a quality life. The further bad news that comes
Blake's way, is when he is told derisively by the office manager (John
Hurt) at the Metal Works, that the job was filled a month ago, and when
Blake demands to speak to the boss, John Dickinson (Robert Mitchum), he
is told by the morbid bossman, to get the hell out of there before he
shoots him with the shotgun he is pointing at him. To console himself,
the low-on-funds easterner buys a small whiskey bottle in a saloon and
when he comes out, a former prostitute who is now selling paper flowers
and has the name of one of the real poet's visionary muses, Thel (Mili
Avital), gets pushed in the mud by some ornery local. Blake helps her up
and the two misfits in town, find that they are kindred spirits and
spend the night in her bed. This turns out to be unfortunate for the
young man, as Thel's former fiancé, Charlie Dickinson (Gabriel Byrne),
the son of the Metal Work's boss comes to visit her, and finding Blake
there, he attempts to kill him, but Thel takes the bullet meant for him,
as Blake, though critically wounded in the chest, uses her gun to stop
Charlie from killing him.</P>
<P>Blake escapes from the town by horse and is spotted on the outskirts by
a wise-talking Indian, calling him a stupid white man, who is treating
his wounds, but who realizes that the bullet is lodged permantly in his
chest and that he will soon be a dead man.</P>
<P>The outcast Indian has taken the name Nobody (Farmer), which is a good
indication of how the white man considered the Native Americans. He was
captured by British soldiers as a youngster and paraded around to
different cities in a cage, and when he was brought to London, he aped
the way the British talked and they thusly gave him a chance to go to
their schools. That's where he read the Western world's greatest
visionary poet, William Blake, and knew he met someone who felt the same
way about life's meaningful things that he did. When the young man tells
him, that he is named William Blake, Nobody thinks that he is a
reincarnation of the poet and he treats this white man with a new
respect, believing that he is a dead white man but his poetry is eternal
and that is what he carries with him in spirit, even if he is ignorant
of it. William Blake states that he is not a poet and doesn't even
understand poetry. Nobody just comments on his modesty. The two
dissimilar men will now go on a spiritual journey that is similar in
some ways to the one the real Blake took and the one the Native
Americans took, and they will also try and elude the white men that
Nobody can smell from their stench, who are following them.</P>
<P>John Dickinson is upset that his son was gunned-down by Blake and that
he also stole his prize pinto, and while talking maniacally to a stuffed
bear, he hires three notorious gunslingers as bounty hunters: the
legendary cold-blooded killer Cole Wilson (Lance Henriksen), who
supposedly "fucked his parents," "killed them," "cooked them up," and
"ate them," and the crazy talking Conway Twill (Michael Wincott), who
sleeps with a teddy bear, and a tough talking black youngster, Johnny
'The Kid' Picket (Eugene Byrd), to go after Blake and bring him back-
dead or alive.</P>
<P>Along the way, Nobody tells William Blake, after he recites to him some
of Blake's poetry, from his "Songs of Innocence," 'Some are born to
sweet delight, Some are born to endless night.'  "William Blake," he
says, "you will learn to use your guns instead of words, your poetry
will now be written in blood."</P>
<P>On his odyssey, Blake will come across many who are trying to get him,
which will include some deranged trappers, Big George Drakulious (Billy
Bob Thompson), Salvatore Jenko (Iggy Pop), who wears a dress, and
Benmont Tench (Jarred Harris), two money-hungry marshals (Jimmie Ray
Weeks and Mark Bringelson), a racist Christian missionary (Alfred
Molina), and an ambusher who wounds him again towards the end of his
journey. They will all be killed by either Nobody or Blake.</P>
<P>The transformation of Blake comes, when he takes peyote and sees things
differently, no longer afraid of dying, he becomes connected Indian
style to the nature of his surroundings, as Nobody leaves him alone so
that he can find out what his inner trip is.</P>
<P>When the two are together again, Blake is prepared for death, barely
clinging to life, as Nobody takes him to spiritual friends among the
Kwakiutl settlement and he passes through the hellish worldly sights for
one last time and then having been prepared for death by Nobody-- who
tells him,"it is like passing through the mirror." He is prepared to die
in peace, as he is placed in a canoe and sent out to sea to return to
the spirit world he came from.</P>
<P>This is an original film, the kind that you are not likely to see being
made from those box office watching directors and those studio heads who
wouldn't know a real visionary work even if the real William Blake was
to appear before them and shout his poems into their ears. What makes
this film particularly exciting, that allows it to have such a
real-Blakeian feel about it, is when some of those magnificent
Blake-like aphorisms are dropped into the film, such as when Nobody
says, "The eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn
of the crow." This fits easily into the flow and grace of this perfectly
made film, where Nobody can say "You don't stop the clouds by building a
ship," and that could either be taken for an old Indian saying, or
something Nobody made up, or one of Blake's sayings from his "Songs of
Innocence" and "Songs of Experience."</P>
<P>The most remarkable aspect about this film, is not only that it didn't
falsely romanticize the Western settler and idolize him for how good he
was with a gun, as most films foolishly do, but it debunked that whole
Western John Ford type of liberal myth, that the cowboy was doing all
that violence to advance civilization, that if the Indian can be
civilized he can and should live with the white man. That sort of
feeling those films conveyed, coming only from the white man's
patronizing position of superiority, left a lot to be desired, even if
Ford in his masterpiece "The Searchers" did tune in to the inherent
racism in America, he still couldn't convey with the kind of depth this
film does, how the Indian viewed the white man.</P>
<P>In this pyschedelic Western film, Blake and Nobody are almost complete
opposites, contraries if you will, borrowing from one of the bard's
adages of how best to gain wisdom. They enjoy each other's company
despite not knowing what the other is saying. Humor is sometimes a
saving grace when all else fails and that is what is indisputably
working here, in the odd relationship between the two travelers; and,
even if what Jarmusch's well-researched, historically accurate film was
delving at, is not always clear to some of the viewers, as the
establishment critics who dutifully lambasted this film because they
said they didn't get it, even though, they say that they laud the poetry
of Blake, but still hated the film for its murkiness ( I feel these are
the same sorts that called Blake a madman in his lifetime and said his
work was rubbish, and I am not surprised in the least at their
negativity toward this original film).</P>
<P>The film had energy; and energy, Blake said, is 'eternal delight.' It
also has a prophetic message for the modern technological age, and that
message is that all is not rosy if we continue to destroy the planet and
ourselves. It's not that cool a thing to just shoot people, as portrayed
in so many popular action films, films that think they have to
substitute action for image.</P>
<PRE>And as Blake wrote in Milton:</PRE>
<P>"Are here frozen to unexpensive deadly destroying terrors,
And War & Hunting, the Two Fountains of the River of Life,
Are become Fountains of bitter Death & of corroding Hell.
Till Brotherhood is chang'd into a Curse & a Flattery
By Differences between Ideas, that Ideas themselves (which are
The Divine Members) may be slain in offerings for sin."</P>
