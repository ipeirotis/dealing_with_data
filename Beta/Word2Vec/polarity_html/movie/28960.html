<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>It's a love it or hate it film. I simply hated it. On its menu for fun, is a
violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongue-and-cheek manner. It's a
serial killer/horror film farce of nonstop over-the-top action and sleaze,
involving decapitations, vampires, biker fights, extended gun play, and an array
of gore that has to be seen to be believed. A film that regales in its vulgarity
and campiness for blood-and-gore, as it goes out of its way to gloss over the
clichés of the conventional B-films. It's geared only for the cult film crowd,
and will make its mark there one way or the other. </P>
<P>The plot involves two psychopath brothers, the older professional bank robber
and killer Seth Gecko (Clooney) and the perverted psychopath killer, Richie
(Tarantino), who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist. They escape jail and
go on a killing spree in Wichita and then flee to a liquor store in a small
Texas border town. They have just robbed a bank and killed a number of cops,
they have also taken a middle-aged bank teller as a hostage. In the liquor store
they kill a Texas Ranger and the store clerk, and burn down the store. Stopping
off in a flop-house motel, Richie rapes and slaughters the hostage. These scenes
are all done with an eye for comedy and parody, if that's possible. On the TV
news, it says they have killed 16 so far and most are Texas Rangers. </P>
<P>The brothers plan to get to Mexico and meet Carlos (Cheech), who will give them
a place of sanctuary for thirty percent of their illegal take. With road blocks
and car searches at the border, the brothers commandeer a motor home of a
vacationing family who stopped at their motel so that the father could sleep in
a real bed. There is the father, Jacob Fuller (Keitel), who just resigned as a
minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died in a car accident; his
sexy 20-year-old, innocent daughter, Kate (Lewis); and, her shy brother Scott
(Liu). It's not explained how he happens to be Chinese. </P>
<P>The story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready
to meet Carlos in a bar/whorehouse for truckers and bikers called the Titty
Twister. The place is open from dawn to dusk, thus the film's title. Here's
where Rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some
absurd fun, as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout. It sells sex to its
patrons, and has exotic stripper Santanico Pandemonium (Hayek) do her alluring
strip before turning into a vampire. The brothers and their hostages have to
fight their way out of the place, as the vampires keep coming and the killings
become the film's staple. </P>
<P>This supposedly clever script did nothing but turn me off, though there were a
few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects and spent
most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings. I'll take a
pass on this one, it's just not my style of a film. The characters were as empty
as the story, and the film was an easy one to forget. </P>
