<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A Monogram cheapie that holds up fairly well as a low-budget B-film noir,
featuring Robert Mitchum in his first starring role. It's directed by the noted
schlock thriller director William Castle, who lets the story simply unfold and
doesn't embellish it with the gimmicks he was later on to employ in his career
of making horror exploitation films. </P>
<P>In a Philadelphia hotel, a very drunk Sam Prescott enters the bar just before
closing time with a lion's head on and stupidly mentions to the one patron whose
face is unseen and the bartender (Lubin) present, that he has $10,000 in cash on
him. The patron doesn't have a hotel room and Sam generously offers to share it
with him. The next morning he's found murdered in his room and his cash is
missing. The newspapers dub it the case of the Silk Stocking murder, as the vic
was strangled with silk stockings. </P>
<P>Millie Baxter (Kim Hunter) leaves her small town Ohio home and goes to a New
York hotel as arranged, to meet her travelling salesman husband of a month, Paul
Baxter (Dean Jagger). She has only been with him a couple of times since they
met in the Ohio restaurant where she was a waitress, and he left her after one
day of marriage to hit the road. They are still really strangers. </P>
<P>Instead of meeting him at the hotel she meets in the lobby her former beau from
her hometown, also a travelling salesman, Fred Graham (Mitchum). He's surprised
that she's married and of all things to a salesman, as he quips: "You didn't
marry me because I was a salesman. Evidently he's a better salesman than me." He
asks her if she received a letter he wrote her in Ohio, and she tells him no. 
When Paul doesn't show up the next day and she doesn't even know where he works
in NYC, Fred takes her to the police and into homicide detective Lt. Blake's
office to report her husband missing. </P>
<P>When Paul telephones her the next day and tells her to come alone to meet him at
an out of the way cafe, Fred tails her and when Paul sees him he flees. Millie
becomes suspicious of his strange behavior and fears he might be the wanted
killer, as she thinks she might have made a mistake in this marriage. But she
somehow trusts him and runs away with him. When he says he was the man in
Prescott's room and was tempted by seeing the money but when he left Prescott,
he was alive and had all his money--she believes him. But the police suspect
that he was the killer and begin a manhunt for him, capturing him just as he
finishes telling Millie he's innocent. </P>
<P>It comes down to either him or Fred being the killer, and that isn't settled
until the climax scene and the surprise ending. </P>
<P>If you don't expect much, you'll be pleased with many of the graceful film noir
touches this low-budget film has and the way it created a chilling NYC
atmosphere for the story to be played out. Hunter is alone and scared to be in
the big city, but she always trusts her instincts. It's a minor film, but it
does a good job of providing some thrills and has its moments of pure visual
delights: like of Hunter staring out her hotel window and her face illuminated
by a flashing neon sign as jazz sounds are coming from the street. </P>
