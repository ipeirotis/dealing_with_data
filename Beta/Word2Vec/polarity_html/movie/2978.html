<P>     Warren Beatty's LOVE AFFAIR is the third incarnation of the tear-
jerker that SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE named as the prototypical "woman's
movie."  Originated in 1939 under the direction of Leo McCarey, LOVE
AFFAIR starred Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne as the playboy and
playgirl couple who meet and fall in love on a transatlantic voyage.
Eighteen years later, McCarey lengthened his script, added considerable
humor, and brought to the screen AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER, with Cary Grant
and Deborah Kerr.  Now, Beatty has taken this story and adapted it for
today's audience.</P>
<P>     Actually, the only switch from the Fifties to the Nineties is a
rather unconvincing plot contrivance to get Mike Gambril (Beatty) and
Terry McKay (Annette Bening) off the Los Angeles-to-Sydney flight on
which they meet and onto a boat.  The plane experiences engine trouble
and has to make a forced landing on a small Pacific island.  Since no
other aircraft can land on the small runway, the passengers are
transported away by ship.  While sailing to Tahiti, Mike and Terry fall
in love.  Some days later, once they reach New York, they agree to wait
three months (to relieve themselves of unwanted fiancees and get their
lives in order), then meet atop the Empire State Building.  What
happens is a matter of record, especially for those who have seen
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, but I won't spoil it here.</P>
<P>     One curiosity is that in all three versions of this story, the man
has had a different name.  For whatever reason, his opposite has
remained Terry McKay (although, admittedly, it would be hard to imagine
Warren Beatty going by the name of Cary Grant's Nickie Ferrante).  Her
name, however, is not the only thing to stay the same.</P>
<P>     While the first half of LOVE AFFAIR remains true in spirit and
general storyline to AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER, the second half (beginning
with the Empire State Building sequence) is almost identical, with much
of the same dialogue being used.  The setting may be modern, but the
style and feel are lifted right out of the romances of the fifties.</P>
<P>     Leo McCarey has said that one of his reasons for casting Grant and
Kerr for AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER is that he wanted to heighten the
comedy.  In the new version, Beatty and Bening bring a certain
playfulness to their roles, but the humor has been toned down.  This
has the unfortunate effect of turning LOVE AFFAIR into an
occasionally-overwrought melodrama.  It's not as manipulative as it
could be, but teary eyes in the audience shouldn't surprise anyone.</P>
<P>     Beatty, despite an undeniable screen presence, is rather flat in
the role of the aging ex-quarterback.  Compared to Grant, he exudes
little charisma.  Beatty's co-star and wife, Annette Bening, on the
other hand, shines, constantly eclipsing her spouse.  Not only does she
have the vivaciousness and sparkle of Kerr, but an almost-eerie
similarity in appearance.</P>
<P>     I'm not sure that women will universally like this film better
than men, but romantics will certainly appreciate it more than cynics.
It is an unabashed love story, filled more with romance than sex, and
concerned with character interaction over plot.  My main complaint with
the film is that it's not sufficiently different from its predecessor
to warrant the remake.  AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER may be thirty-seven years
old, but it still stands up well.  With so few changes, this makes
1994's LOVE AFFAIR redundant.  Charming, but redundant.</P>
