<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A quasi-documentary crime film directed by Elia Kazan that tells the
true story of the 1924 murder of Father Hubert Dahme in Bridgeport,
Connecticut, the subsequent arrest and trial of a jobless drifter, and
the efforts of the state's attorney Henry Harvey (Dana Andrews) to
uncover the truth. The noir look of the film is enhanced by it being
shot at the actual location of the incident.</P>
<P>One evening we see a lone gunman wearing a light colored fedora and a
dark coat walk up to the popular Protestant reverend, Father Lambert, on
the small-town Main Street and within a few inches from him, raise his
32-calibre pistol and fire. There were seven witnesses but none could
catch him or provide an exact description.</P>
<P>Political pressure begins to mount as the police have no clues and a few
weeks go by without any progress in the case. The owner (Leverett) of
the "The Record," the newspaper that wishes to exploit this party's
current administration that swept into office on a reform platform to
clean up the corruption, by exposing their ineptness in catching the
murderer, as it has their ace political reporter, Dave Woods (Levene),
write hard-hitting stories about the police being amateurs. The
newspaper owner hopes to win the election by this crusade against the
reformers, cynically wanting to get back into power any way he could.</P>
<P>But the police catch a break and a drifter is picked up in Ohio who
matches the description and he is armed with the same type of pistol
that killed the pastor. He is John Waldron (Kennedy), an ex-army vet who
was honored during WW11. When he is grilled by the crusty police chief
(Cobb) and his lead detective (Karl) he confesses after being sweated
for long hours and identified by all the witnesses.</P>
<P>The audience is let in on a secret, that Waldron couldn't have been the
killer, as an earlier scene, right after the murder, shows the assistant
pastor being told in no uncertain terms by Father Lambert that if he
doesn't do it himself, that he will have to report the assistant to a
mental hospital so he could get help for his problem. It is that scene
that leads us to believe that the motive for the crime was personal and
that, in all probability, the assistant did the killing.</P>
<P>The town has an honest chief of police and district attorney, and it
also has the usual dishonest politicians. Henry is told by the nervous
party official, Paul Harris (Begley), that he better convict Waldron,
that the party better win the next election and stay in power, or else
his life is ruined and he will take everyone else down with him, that he
invested all his money in a corrupt land deal and needs his
administration to buy that land from him or else he loses his life
savings. The catch is that he tricked Henry's wife Madge (Jane) into
lending him money for the deal and he made it look like she's in on the
corruption. This comes at a time when Henry is sure that Waldron is
innocent because of his careful investigation that finds out Waldron's
gun could not have been the one used in the crime because of a
malfunctioning gun pin.</P>
<P>It becomes a question of what will Henry do in court, and this is
answered as he shocks the town by seeking to exonerate the accused
drifter. The grateful drifter is set free and the corruption in town is
only touched upon, but the case is re-opened and the killer we are told
was never caught. The Dana Andrews character is the real Homer S.
Cummings, who went on to become the attorney general under FDR-from
1933-39.</P>
<P>This taut, well-told story, is suspenseful in the noir tradition of
showing dark shadows and setting a dark mood. The acting is superb,
screenwriter Richard Murphy received an Academy Award nomination, and
Elia Kazan, in his afterthought comments about the film, mentioned that
he wished he played up the corruption part of the story in more detail.</P>
