<P>     One night in 1959, four people (Charles Grodin, Kyra Sedgwick,
Alfre Woodard, and Tom Sizemore) board a city bus in San Francisco,
each suffering a major life crisis.  They are never given a chance to
solve their problems because the bus crashes and all on board are
killed.  However, instead of being assumed into heaven (or the other
place, as the case may be), they find themselves stuck on earth as the
"imaginary friends" of just-born Thomas Reilly (who grows up to be
Robert Downey, Jr.).  When it becomes apparent that the quartet are
seriously warping Thomas' personality (he talks to people that no one
else can see), they decide to fade from sight and leave him on his
own.  The separation isn't permanent, though.  Twenty years later, they
reappear to straighten out Thomas' life, as well as to set their own
personal ghosts to rest, before they are whisked away to inhabit new
bodies.</P>
<P>     The above description attempts to capture some of the nuances of a
needlessly-convoluted and poorly-conceived storyline that someone
should have had the intelligence to pare down to reasonable levels.
HEART AND SOULS, as is often the case with films scripted by four
people, is at odds with itself, frequently not seeming to know where to
go next and, on those occasions when it has a set direction, proceeding
in the most confused and unsatisfying manner possible.</P>
<P>     For nearly fifty years, film makers have been trying to recapture
the drama and magic of Frank Capra's 1946 American classic IT'S A
WONDERFUL LIFE.  To this date, no one has succeeded.  HEART AND SOULS
is yet another stab in the dark, and not only does it fail, but it
turns out to be worse than many of the efforts before it.  In
retrospect, it's hard to find many good things to say about this
movie.</P>
<P>     The thing about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is that it took its time
developing the character of its protagonist, George Bailey.  Not until
the final quarter of the movie does the supernatural intervention
occur.  In HEART AND SOULS, while approximately a half-hour is spent
setting the story up, there are too many characters to flesh out.  None
of them are sufficiently fleshed out, and the rest of the movie ends up
falling flat because of it.  Character identification is crucial in a
film of this nature and, when it doesn't happen, the picture is
doomed.</P>
<P>     From start to finish, the script consciously and mechanically
tries to manipulate the audience to laughter and tears.  Partially as a
result of being too obvious about its intentions and partially because
of heavy-handed direction, it doesn't succeed.  Most of the jokes
aren't very funny and the scenes designed to strum the heart strings
are more embarrassing that touching.  When a rapport hasn't been
developed between the characters and the audience, attempts to make us
cry can end up looking rather silly.</P>
<P>     HEART AND SOULS has a fine cast, which is why it's surprising that
the acting is so lackluster.  I suppose part of the blame can go to the
behind-the-scenes team that "crafted" this dud, but the performers
can't be absolved of all blame.  Of the major participants, only Tom
Sizemore does a reasonable job.  Robert Downey, Jr., relies too much on
what he did in CHAPLIN (whenever one of the spirits enters his body he
gives a Tramp-like lurch).  Kyra Sedgwick, Alfre Woodard, and Charles
Grodin are flat, and Elisabeth Shue displays all the range of a water
pistol.  David Paymer, who was decent in Billy Crystal's MR.  SATURDAY
NIGHT, manages to be incredibly tedious in a small role as the bus
driver.</P>
<P>     There are a few energetic scenes that save this production from
being an utter debacle.  Chief among these is a concert given by
B. B. King (appearing as himself) where Thomas, under the influence of
Charles Grodin's Harrison Winslow, gives a throbbing rendition of the
"Star Spangled Banner."  There are also a few mildly humorous
interludes with a police officer, although the conclusion of that
particular subplot is laughably bad.</P>
<P>     For all of its attempts to weave a spell on the audience, HEART
AND SOULS manages to be annoyingly blatant in what it's trying to do.
Nevertheless, if you're someone who drools over happy endings, this may
be the movie for you (provided you can stomach the film's many other
shortcomings).  It doesn't just have one of these, but five, each more
cloying than the one before.  A rare treat for those who don't mind
going into sugar shock.</P>
