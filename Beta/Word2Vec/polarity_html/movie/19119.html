<PRE>TARZAN</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>"You'll go ape over TARZAN because it's more fun than a barrel of
monkeys!"  Okay, there's the quote in case Disney wants to put
something in their ads for the movie.</P>
<P>Disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from
the very beginning, skipping the usual main title sequence and putting
us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a
sinking ship.  Father, mother, and infant somehow make it to shore
amidst a rousing song by Phil Collins, and have soon built a treehouse
which would impress the Swiss Family Robinson.  It's amazing, the
kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack.  Before you
know it, an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands
of Kala (Glenn Close), a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to
a predatory leopard.  Against the wishes of her mate and family
leader, Kerchak (Lance Henricksen), she takes on the infant boy as her
own.</P>
<P>TARZAN is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the
African jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either
humanity or the wild. Much of Tarzan's young life is spent trying to
become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "father,"
which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his
attempts.  All he's looking for is acceptance, perhaps a goal easily
identifiable by young viewers, but one which will ring true with a lot
of adults.  When you really think about it, this story fits right into
the Disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end.  Look back
on past Disney animated features and you'll see the trend.</P>
<P>Growing up, Tarzan (voiced by Alex D. Linz as a child, and by Tony
Goldwyn as an adult) has a couple of friends.  One is an ape named
Terk (Rosie O'Donnell), and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of
an elephant named Tantor (Wayne Knight).  Both provide the requisite
comic relief (Timon and Poombah from THE LION KING immediately come to
mind) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the Disney mold.
I'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of
these films.  Just fill in the blanks!  Can you see it?  "Now we have
to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into
mischief, but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it.
We've already had a fish and a crab, and we've had a candle and a
teapot, a genie and a dog, a few stone statues....have we had an ape
and an elephant yet?  Well, there we go!"</P>
<P>Of course, there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line, so Jane
(Minnie Driver) gets introduced about halfway through.  Together with
her father Dr. Porter (Nigel Hawthorne) and the big game hunter
Clayton (Brian Blessed), Jane is on an expedition to find and study
the wild gorillas of Africa.  She discovers the man raised by apes and
is enchanted almost immediately, and soon shares an amusing version of
the compulsory "You Tarzan, Me Jane" scene.  Thankfully, those aren't
the exact words.  However, I found it distracting that Tarzan is going
"ohh ohh ee ee" one second and then tells Jane his name in this manly
voice with perfect diction.  How does he tell his name to another ape?
"Ohh ohh ee - Tarzan - ee ee ohh?"  Well, regardless of my picky
nature, the romance actually works as only Disney romance can:  Purely
contrived, but for some reason rather believable.  But hey, Tarzan's a
young adult.  Do you think he dated a few of the female apes before
meeting Jane?  Isn't that illegal in most countries?  Oh, well.  I
don't think Disney will be using my quote anymore.</P>
<P>TARZAN departs from the usual Disney feature in that this one is not a
musical.  There's lots of music to be sure, but not a single character
song in the whole hour and a half of running time.  We instead get
more of a Phil Collins concert, as no less than five of his original
songs are used as interlude material.  This isn't really a bad thing,
as the songs are very high-energy and catchy (I found myself singing
one to myself for most of the following day); it's just different.  Do
yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound
system, because the music will come through astonishingly well and
really enhance the movie.</P>
<P>With each new feature, Disney animation gets even better.  Not
necessarily by leaps and bounds, but since they put out a new film
each year, a steady rate of improvement is apparent, and this
definitely shows in TARZAN.  There are a couple of scenes where the
animation achieves a near 3-D effect, and a number of scenes which
feature Tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying.  The
way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of
skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers, and had me thinking this
isn't just Tarzan, it's "Extreme Tarzan."  However, TARZAN does not
seem to have what I call its "chandelier scene," which is the one
scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate
amount of effort, utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the
animation absolutely breathtaking.  Lasting but a few seconds at most,
it's been the signature of nearly every Disney animated feature since
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, in which the castle ballroom chandelier was
rendered in stunning detail.</P>
<P>As usual, the voice talent is up to snuff, convincingly make you
believe in the convictions of animated characters.  The one poor
choice in casting, however, was Rosie O'Donnell.  Going into the film,
I didn't know she was even a part of it, but when Terk started
talking, I recognized her voice immediately.  Her performance was
fine, but through the rest of the film I kept thinking, "That's no boy
ape, that Rosie O'Donnell."  Distracting to say the least.</P>
<P>I'll admit I've never read the Edgar Rice Burroughs story "Tarzan of
the Apes," so I couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the
book.  But unless you're a purist, you should have few objections to
this film.  With solid performances, action, adventure, a bit of
romance, and great music and animation, TARZAN should appeal to the
kids and to the kid in all of us.</P>
<P>Note:  When I wrote my review of MULAN a year ago, I went off on the
promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a
Disney animated feature.  This time, I'll just say that I went to
McDonald's yesterday to treat myself to a McFlurry, and Tarzan was on
the cup.  'Nuff said.</P>
