<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Shot almost entirely on digital video with a hand-held camera, Miguel
Arteta's (Star Maps) Chuck and Buck is an arresting homo-erotic tale
about the pangs of growing up while still stuck emotionally at an
adolescent stage. It is about someone who is desperate to find someone
to love him, more than it is about homosexuality as a sex drive. It
features screenwriter Mike White as the mentally unbalanced Buck and
Chris Weitz as Chuck, the unwanted receiver of Buck's affection.</P>
<P>Buck's mother suddenly dies while having a coughing attack and the
27-year-old, who has lived his entire life in his mother's house, sends
a letter to his best friend Chuck from childhood days, who moved a
long-time ago to Los Angeles, playing on his sympathies as he lures him
to the funeral. Chuck is now a high-powered successful executive for
show biz music personalities (it looks like a role Tom Cruise would
play) and is engaged to the attractive and congenial Carln (Colt). Buck
is more happy to see Chuck than he is sad that his mother is dead, as he
longingly smiles at Chuck with his frozen dead-pan look, refusing to
recognize that Chuck has grown up differently than he has and is called
by everyone by his adult name Charlie.</P>
<P>Invited into Buck's room, which is filled with childhood toys, the same
toys he played with  as a kid, Chuck realizes that Buck has not
developed from childhood. Making excuses to head back quickly to L.A.,
Chuck is suddenly grabbed in the crotch by Buck foolishly playing the
same childhood homosexual games they played when they were eleven. Chuck
rejects him but he doesn't communicate this with his fiancée who, in a
socially correct move, invites Buck to L.A.. Chuck figures he will never
leave his mother's house anyway, but is startled when Buck calls to tell
him he's coming to visit, as he spends the rest of the film trying to
put him off with one excuse after another.</P>
<P>Buck is not someone who can take a hint, so he goes to L.A. anyway,
moves into a motel with all his childhood toys, smiles nervously while
leering at Chuck, sucks lollipops constantly and is dealt with in an icy
manner by the self-inflated executive, who is being stalked and is
receiving a barrage of unwanted calls by his disturbed friend. Chuck
never knows quite how to handle him, and so Buck continues to
relentlessly pursue him (it seemed odd that a person in Chuck's position
wouldn't know how to ditch someone).</P>
<P>Buck hangs around L.A. stalking Chuck to no avail, but he finds a little
fringe theater across the street from Chuck's office, where he
approaches Beverly, the earthy children's theater house manager (Lupe
Ontiveros), and tells her he wrote a children's play called "Frank &
Hank" and asks her to direct it even though she has never directed a
play before. She asks for $25 an hour and tells him it would take four
weeks of rehearsals to put on this one performance play. These scenes
are the heart of the film, as they bring out whatever brilliance there
is to be found in the characterizerations, depicting in an honest way
how those who are not destined to live a conventional life behave with
each other in a natural setting. The film allowed the supporting
characters to interact with each other, not going for the cheap comedy
it could have gone after by just making fun of Buck's tortured
character. Lupe Ontiveros brought an endearing and maternal warmth to
the film; Sam (Paul Weitz, Chris' brother), tries out for the main part
and gets it because he looks like Chuck, adding spice to the film; and,
one actress mentions that she is not inviting her agent to see this one.
This makes the supporting characters not that much different than Buck
as to their feelings of insecurity.</P>
<P>A gnawing flaw to this film is that it hits a dead spot, which comes
after the play is presented. Through Buck's manipulations, he gets Carln
to drag Chuck to see the play because she is curious about their
childhood friendship. The thinly disguised autobiographical play,
embarrasses Chuck. The film seemed to run out of steam at that point,
having exhausted itself of its underlying probe into the tormented soul
of Buck, who is seen more as a pathetic figure who is desperately in
need of being touched, someone who does not possess the social skills to
relate with others. The film takes a few deep breathes and returns for a
discerning conclusion, which was thoroughly credible and well-presented.</P>
<P>The relationships Buck makes that are endearing, are with Beverly and
Sam. Beverly can relate to how messed up he is, thinking who isn't
messed up in the world she frequents, therefore even though she thinks
of him as a weirdo, he's a nice weirdo. His relationship with the
boorish Sam, a bad actor who is also a social outcast, but of the
hetersexual variety, is based on the need to be accepted they both have.
After making a foolish sexual play for Sam, Buck is told to lay off that
stuff and they'll get along fine, as he moves into the apartment next to
Sam's. Sam figures Buck will never complain about the noise from the
music he plays late at night like the last tenant, a woman, who angrily
moved out.</P>
<P>The film hits a raw nerve about childhood experiences and how they are
perceived, and in the process tells a love story that is not restricted
to homosexuality. A tremendous effort by the indie film-makers is
realized to tell a moving character study, thereby achieving such a
high-quality film on such a low-budget, as it daringly rests its
unsentimental case on such a thin plot and succeeds because its
characterizations came to life and the effort to look at friendship and
human behavior was an honest one. It is also a disarmingly funny movie.</P>
