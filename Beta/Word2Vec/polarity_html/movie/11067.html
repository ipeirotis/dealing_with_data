<P>     What happens when the idealism of revolutionaries turns rotten?  Or 
when the methods of so-called "freedom fighters" become difficult to 
distinguish from those of the men they're struggling to topple?  These 
are just two of the issues addressed by Bruno Barreto's behind-the-
scenes look into the politics of revolution and terrorism, and how the 
best intentions often lead to ugly results.</P>
<P>     The setting is Rio de Janeiro in July 1969.  The military junta, 
which has ruled Brazil since staging a coup five years ago, has 
suspended civil rights and the freedom of the press.  The iron fist is 
closing, and the number of jailed political prisoners is on the rise.  
Universities have become a hotbed of discord.  The United States, deeply 
embroiled in Vietnam, has little time to spend on events in South 
America, although an ambassador, Charles Burke Elbrick (Alan Arkin), 
remains in Rio to keep the lines of communication open.  </P>
<P>     While there are many revolutionary groups, most are confused and 
fragmented.  The power lies with the military, not with the dissidents.  
One small band, The October Revolutionary Movement, emboldened by their 
successful "liberation of funds" from a bank, are preparing a major 
sally in the underground war -- they intend to kidnap the American 
Ambassador and hold him hostage.  Their demands:  the government must 
free 15 political prisoners within 48 hours of the abduction, or they 
will kill Elbrick.  The deadline will not be pushed back.  Two months 
later, The October Revolutionary Movement is ready to put their plan 
into action, and, mostly as a result of good luck, they capture the 
ambassador on September 4.</P>
<P>     The men and women comprising The October Revolutionary Movement are 
a diverse group.  There's Fernando (Pedro Cardoso), a passionate 
intellectual whose skill is with pens, not guns.  Maria (Fernanda 
Torres) is the fiery brunette who founded the organization and is trying 
to fashion it into something more disciplined than a "bunch of middle-
aged kids out for an adventure."  Renee (Claudia Abreu) is a 
compassionate young woman whose gentle manner makes her an unlikely 
kidnapper. Toledo (Nelson Dantas) is an aging freedom fighter brought in 
to lend his experience to the venture.  And Jonas (Matheus Nachtergaele) 
is Toledo's no-nonsense companion, who takes over the military side of 
the operation.</P>
<P>     FOUR DAYS IN SEPTEMBER works to some degree as a thriller, but it's 
more effective as a drama.  The film makes a number of telling points 
about the consequences of adopting violence as a legitimate means of 
revolution.  John Sayles' MEN WITH GUNS investigates the same issue from 
a different perspective.  When both sides of a struggle employ similar 
tactics, is the difference in ideology enough to differentiate them?  
The members of October Revolutionary Movement start out with the 
intention of doing their part to restore freedom to Rio, but, shortly 
after holding a loaded gun to Elbrick's head, Fernando pronounces that 
the entire endeavor "was a dream that failed."  Those words, and the 
epilogue that follows, underscore Barreto's point that revolution (or 
terrorism, depending on your viewpoint) is more likely to generate 
disillusionment than heroism.</P>
<P>     During the course of his two days of captivity, Elbrick forms a 
tentative bond with two of his captors.  Renee tends to his head wound 
and offers soothing words of comfort.  Fernando talks politics and 
philosophy with him.  As in both THE CRYING GAME and OCTOBER, we see how 
the relationship between a hostage and his abductor can unbalance the 
situation.  Suddenly, each side becomes humanized to the other.  It's no 
longer a matter of slogans, but of flesh-and-blood human beings.  Maria 
and Jonas remain aloof in case they have to act against Elbrick.</P>
<P>     FOUR DAYS IN SEPTEMBER also goes to great lengths to demonstrate 
that the members of The October Revolutionary Movement are amateurs.  
They make enough mistakes for the police to be able to track them down.  
But the flawed nature of their plans makes this film all the more 
believable (it is based on a true story).  Another aspect of the movie 
that enhances its credibility is the way Barreto works to detail the 
interpersonal relationships among members of the movement, such as the 
animosity between Fernando and Jonas and the sexual tension between 
Maria and Fernando.</P>
<P>     The film's best performance is given by American actor Alan Arkin, 
who successfully essays a cultured man attempting to retain his dignity 
in a nearly-impossible situation.  One standout sequence has Arkin's 
Elbrick characterizing his masked captors by describing their hands.  As 
Fernando, Pedro Cardoso does a solid job of presenting the 
disintegration of a idealist.  The other noteworthy performer, Fernanda 
Torres, plays Maria with fire and emotion.</P>
<P>     Under a different director, FOUR DAYS IN SEPTEMBER could have 
turned into a routine thriller.  Indeed, at times, the movie treads 
through familiar territory – this isn't exactly a unique perspective – 
but the intelligence and passion in Barreto's approach lift the film to 
a higher level.  This motion picture is not groundbreaking, but it is 
fascinating and thought-provoking, and offers a little suspense to 
enliven the drama. </P>
