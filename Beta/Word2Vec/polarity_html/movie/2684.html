<PRE>                                 BLOWN AWAY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jeff Bridges, Tommy Lee Jones, Forest Whitaker, Lloyd
Bridges, Suzy Amis.
Screenplay:  Joe Batteer & John Rice.
Director:  Stephen Hopkins.</P>
<P>     Sometimes, timing is everything.  A few years ago, Kevin Costner
beat two other Robin Hood projects into production, forcing one to
television and killing the other entirely.  This year, Costner is on
the other end, as his WYATT EARP was beaten into theaters *and* onto
video by TOMBSTONE.  Now, in the mad bomber department, BLOWN AWAY
comes hard on the heels of SPEED, and suffers greatly by comparison.
SPEED's greatest asset was that it never took itself seriously; BLOWN
AWAY, on the other hand, takes itself far too seriously.  Though there
are some nice moments of suspense, BLOWN AWAY sputters out in puddles
of melodrama.</P>
<P>     Jeff Bridges stars as Jimmy Dove, a member of Boston's bomb
squad.  What only Jimmy's Uncle Max (Lloyd Bridges) knows is that Jimmy
was once Liam McGivney, a radical in Northern Ireland who now sees
defusing bombs as a kind of penance for the crimes of his youth.  But a
blast from the past comes to Boston in the form of Ryan Gaerity (Tommy
Lee Jones), Jimmy's former Irish cohort.  Escaped from prison after 20
years in custody, Gaerity blames Jimmy for his incarceration and begins
targeting friends and loved ones with elaborate bombs, including
Jimmy's new wife (Suzy Amis).  Jimmy, along with his new partner
(Forest Whitaker) must track down Gaerity before all of Beantown is
blown away.</P>
<P>     There's no better way to describe the key problem with BLOWN AWAY
than to say that it's overblown but underdeveloped.  Everything in the
screenplay by Joe Batteer and John Rice feels forced and artificial.
Nothing exemplifies this more than the attempt to ladle on the Irish
atmosphere.  The characters in BLOWN AWAY speak in heavy brogues, drink
Guinness, dance jigs, even listen to us ... everything, practically,
but say "faith an' begorrah."  Fine, they're Irish already; they're
just not real.  The same is true of the Boston locations, which are so
omnipresent they cease to be atmospheric and become simply oppressive
(and there's no excuse for a television announcer calling a home run in
Fenway Park "over the Green Monster" when the ball is shown landing
over the right field wall).  And the same is true of the big emotional
breakdowns, and the slow motion build-ups to the explosions, and the
length of nearly every scene.  BLOWN AWAY simply never clicks because,
like Gaerity's bombs, everything is far more convoluted than it needs
to be functionally.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, two of the most talented actors in America are stuck
with underwritten characters and ineffectual direction.  Jeff Bridges
is supposed to be haunted by his past, but instead he generally appears
simply dazed.  He brings no energy and none of the intelligence he
usually brings to his roles.  Tommy Lee Jones doesn't fare much better,
as there is never any clear sense of Gaerity's motivation or state of
mind.  He's just plain weird, bouncing on beds and making bizarre
videotapes, but for all his supposed cock-eyed creativity he never
comes off as smart enough to be genuinely threatening.  Forest Whitaker
is good as the cocky new guy on the bomb squad, but he is the only
bright spot among the actors.  When two actors like Bridges and Jones
go wrong, it's difficult not to point the finger of blame at a director
who wasn't doing his job.</P>
<P>     Though he fails his actors, Stephen Hopkins has other things
working.  He manages to create a mounting tension with each subsequent
bomb, as we begin to suspect that at any given moment, anything could
be a trigger.  This is nowhere better handled than in a great scene
where Bridges' wife and stepdaughter proceed through their kitchen
turning on appliances which may be set to blow.  But the production
just isn't lean enough to sustain that energy.  Watching BLOWN AWAY, I
felt that I had had slightly too much to drink:  everything seemed a
step slow and Peter Levy's photography seemed slightly out-of-focus.
Oh, to be sure, there are lots of big explosions in BLOWN AWAY, but the
amount of cinematic heat generated could be measured with an oral
thermometer.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 hidden bombs:  4.</PRE>
