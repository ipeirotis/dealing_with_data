<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A fine example of a 1940s type of film noir, as adapted from a Cornell Woolrich
novel. It's a chilling tale about an innocent man who is framed for murder and
is scheduled to die in the electric chair, but his loyal secretary and the
police inspector who arrested him work on his behalf to clear him of the
charges. The acting was commendable and the development of the dark noir world
was very well established; but, the case itself seemed hardly believable-- the
dialogue was atrocious, and the crazed, genius killer looking down at his hands
and getting dizzy spells was more ridiculous than a truthful presentation. The
film had too many defects that just couldn't be overlooked, yet overall it had a
mesmerizing effect--largely due to the imaginative direction Robert Siodmak gave
it. His use of German expressionism, shadowy street figures, the desperation of
the chase of an innocent and helpless man, and making the hot summer streets of
the Broadway night fit into the story, all gave the film a rich noir flavoring
and made it an original American work. </P>
<P>Scott Henderson (Curtis) is a handsome, successful, 32-year-old civil engineer,
who is glumly sitting alone in a NYC bar because his wife failed to meet him
there as arranged. They had a spat, where he asked for a divorce but she
refused. He is now trying to make up with her and plans to take her to a
Broadway show. A glum, well-dressed woman with a fancy hat, sits next to him at
the bar. He tempts her with the tickets as a remedy to cheer themselves up. She
reluctantly accepts and they take a taxi to the show, but her condition is that
she wants no names mentioned and wishes to remain anonymous. </P>
<P>At the show the sexy Latin entertainer, Miss Monteiro (Aurora), is wearing the
same unique hat onstage for her routine and is vainly upset at seeing the
'phantom lady' with the same hat. Also, the drummer, Cliff (Elisha), notices the
flamboyant hat in the audience and tries to flirt with the wearer of the hat.
After the show, the mysterious lady just leaves without a word. </P>
<P>Returning to his apartment, he's greeted by a trio of detectives, as the one in
charge, Inspector Burgess (Gomez), informs him that his wife was strangled with
one of his ties and the knot was so tight that they had to cut it open. </P>
<P>When Scott gives his alibi to the police, they can't corroborate that he was
with a woman. The bartender (Tombes), the taxi driver (Novello), and the Latin
performer deny they saw him with a woman who wore such a hat, though they recall
seeing him. His alibi turns out to be a phantom lady (Terry), and since his
whole case hinges on her as an alibi--the jury convicts him when he can't
produce her. </P>
<P>With eighteen days to go before the execution Scott's secretary, Carol (Raines),
who has secretly pined for him and believes he's innocent, decides to do
anything she can to help and has remained in NYC rather than return to her
native Kansas. She has been tracking down the eye witnesses to his alibi on her
own, and has learned that the bartender was bribed by a man; but, he gets run
over accidently while fleeing from her questions. </P>
<P>She gets surprising help from Inspector Burgess, who now believes Scott is
innocent. But the case is closed and he can only help her in an unofficial
capacity. When Carol zeroes in on the sleazy drummer in the Broadway show,
Cliff, and gets him to take her to his apartment as he believes she's a hooker,
she learns that someone paid him $500 to shut his mouth and say he never saw
that woman. She's forced to flee his apartment when he attacks her, but she
calls Burgess to rescue her. But it's too late, because by the time he arrives
at the scene Cliff is found by them strangled to death on the floor of his
apartment. </P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in the next paragraph. </P>
<P>It was brought out during the trial that before Scott left his wife to go to the
bar, he had cocktails with some business clients and his best friend Jack Marlow
(Tone). Marlow left early that evening by boat for South America and has
supposedly been there since, but has now returned and pretends to be helping
clear his friend of the charges. But he turns out to be a paranoid artist, with
delusions that he's a genius and better than anyone else. He's been having an
affair with Scott's wife, but when she rejected him that night and refused to go
with him to Brazil his ego couldn't stand it and so he strangled her and framed
his friend. </P>
<P>The Phantom Lady proved to be a boon to the German-born director's career, as
the film  was his first American success. </P>
