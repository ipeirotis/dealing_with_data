<P>     Even though I have the utmost respect for Richard Dreyfuss as an 
actor, his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any 
particular level of quality.  Like everyone else, Dreyfuss has bills to 
pay, so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad 
movies.  Consequently, while his career highlights include JAWS, CLOSE 
ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, STAKEOUT, and TIN MEN, his resume is 
dotted with titles like MOON OVER PARADOR, LET IT RIDE, and now 
KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE.</P>
<P>     Let me start out by saying that KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE is occasionally 
funny (although never riotously so), but that's about its only asset.  
The best word to describe this film is "asinine."  The target audience 
would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the 
numerous sexual innuendoes, which are aimed at someone going through 
puberty.  KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE tries to be a zany, off-the-wall comedy, 
but the film makers have forgotten three important rules.  The first is 
that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist.  The second is 
that viewers should be able to identify with, or at least care about, a 
character or two.  Finally, and most importantly, more than 5% of the 
jokes have to work.  </P>
<P>     Once upon a time, James Krippendorf (Dreyfuss) was a respected 
professor of anthropology at little Bounderby College.  He and his wife 
obtained a grant to seek out a "lost tribe" somewhere in the wilds of 
New Guinea, a goal which they never accomplished.  Shortly after their 
return from the failed trip, Krippendorf's wife died and he was left 
with the Herculean task of raising three children -- Shelly (Natasha 
Lyonne), Mickey (Gregory Smith), and Edmund (Carl Michael Linder) -- on 
his own.  Now, over a year later, the college wants to see the results 
of the money they gave Krippendorf (which he has spent not on research, 
but on things for his family), so they send a new member of their 
faculty, Professor Veronica Micelli (Jenna Elfman), to inform him that 
he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings.  When he 
arrives at the college for the momentous event, rather than telling the 
truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds, 
he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe, the "Shelmikedmu". To 
provide video footage, he films his children dressed in native garb.  
Soon, much to Krippendorf's surprise, the Shelmikedmu are a national 
phenomenon.  But one disaffected professor (Lily Tomlin) is determined 
to prove that the tribe is a fraud.</P>
<P>     The only way KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE works is if you assume that all of 
the characters (not to mention the viewers) are dumber than dirt.  
Unfortunately, it's impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of 
putzes like this.  Director Todd Holland completely fails to develop any 
character into something more substantial than a device to implement 
various dubious gags.  Meanwhile, attempts at satirizing the shallowness 
of American culture (i.e., how easily the public can be fooled into 
jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend) come across as feeble and 
derivative. </P>
<P>     The acting in underwhelming.  Dreyfuss has definitely not given his 
"all" to the role of James Krippendorf.  Alongside him, Jenna Elfman, 
the spunky co-star of TV's DHARMA AND GREG, radiates perkiness and 
little else.  This quality, while fine for a 22-minute television 
program, quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature-length 
movie.  No one in the supporting cast -- Lily Tomlin, David Ogden 
Stiers, Natasha Lyonne (Woody Allen's daughter in EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE 
YOU) -- excels.</P>
<P>     I know that a movie's in trouble when it's half the length of 
TITANIC, but seems much longer.  Most of what comes on screen is generic 
sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while 
dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set.  
If there's any upside, it's that I don't see much box-office support 
developing for this lame, ill-marketed miscue.  KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE will 
quickly become extinct.</P>
