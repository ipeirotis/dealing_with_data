<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense), the young and successful
director-writer of "Unbreakable," once again continues his ongoing love
affair he is having with his home city of Philadelphia by again setting
the film there. He also brings his love for comic book super-heroes into
the plot, as this commercial film explores the world of opposites, of a
super-hero vs. an arch-villain, delving into those who see the world
upside down, and of an ordinary man discovering who he is and finding
what purpose he has in life. The payoff in the film comes in a slick
surprise ending, as now has become the custom of the director and is
what the audience expects.</P>
<P>Night has honed his skills from his previous films by showing an
improvement in technique and filmmaking style, while continuing his
penchant for making films with box-office pop. Though there is a certain
disdainful emptiness in this film, as there was in his others, but this
film sustains itself with the keen performances by the understated one
Bruce Willis gives and the punctiliously perverse one Samuel L. Jackson
gives, as the film is able to amble along at its leisurely pace,
building on character development and the unique relationship the two
stars develop, until the mystery story takes hold in the last twenty
minutes and puts the exclamation point on the far-fetched tale it was
weaving.</P>
<P>This subdued action film is unlike other action-hero films, as the
action is not the thing here. What counts the most, is what secret the
film is covering up and why. It is especially delightful for those who
like puzzlers and think they can gather enough clues to take a stab at
guessing the outcome. Even though Night has matured as a director, this
surprise ending is not as engaging as the one he came up with in the
blockbuster The Sixth Sense, which caught audiences completely
off-guard. But this film is a more mature work and has fuller
characterizations. So the former has arguably a better ending, but this
one is a better realized overall film.</P>
<P>The basic plot is simple. David Dunn (Willis) is a security guard for
the university stadium and is returning to Philly from New York, where
he applied for another job. He seems nervous on the train, taking off
his wedding band before a pretty woman (Stefanson) sits next to him. He
strikes up a polite but flirtatious conversation with her, but he seems
to make her edgy and she changes seats to get away from him. As his face
changes expressions, we can sense something tragic is about to happen.
That event is the train crash, and when he wakes up in the hospital, he
learns that all of the passengers and crew aboard were killed and that
he was miraculously the only survivor, and amazingly comes out of the
crash without a scratch.</P>
<P>David is mysteriously contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), an
art dealer in comic books, who is an advent follower of the super-hero
stories ever since his mother introduced him to comics so that she can
lure him outside to play with the other kids. Because he was born with a
genetic defect, he is crippled and suffers from having extremely fragile
bones, and was teased by kids for always falling and getting hurt. They
hurtfully called him "Mr. Glass," a name that still conceals the anger
he has inside him for being born physically defective.</P>
<P>Elijah believes that David may be the 'unbreakable' person he is looking
for, someone to give hope for this mediocre age we live in, as he
believes the super-hero myth is as true as if it was history -- which is
asking a lot for an adult audience to swallow, but...that's Hollywood!
He fantastically believes that David, who thinks of himself only as an
ordinary man, might be unbreakable and possessed with the ability to see
things others can't, that he was born with the ability and need to
protect others. And if he has a weakness, it might be water, as even
Superman had a weakness from kryptonite. His reasoning supposes -- "If
there is someone like me in the world, shouldn't there be someone at the
other end of the spectrum?" The only question he asks of David to prove
his point, is if he ever remembers getting sick. David thinks Elijah is
daffy, but soon strange things begin to happen that make him slowly
realize there might be something true about what Elijah is saying.</P>
<P>David's life is contrasted with Elijah's.</P>
<P>David fell in love with his future wife Audrey (Wright) and even gave up
his love for football because she hates any form of violence and decided
he rather be with her than play football. He did this after he was in a
car accident with her and really didn't get hurt, even repressing his
memory to believe he did get hurt, using that hurt as his excuse for
giving up the sport so she wouldn't feel guilty. He now lives with her
and their young, impressionable son (Clark), though his relationship
with her has become strained because there is a certain lack of
fulfillment about his life that he feels everyday when he awakens and
there is an insecurity that has taken place in the love between them.
David is someone who seems to be carrying around with him a sad burden,
which is manifest in an empathy he has with others that is very intense.
He is so bottled-up, that he is not able to adequately communicate with
either his wife or his son.</P>
<P>Elijah is his opposite. He is a crippled black man who grew up in the
slums with a nurturing mother and through comic books found a way to
success by using his knowledge and arrogant personality to become an
established comic book art gallery owner. His personality is as
flamboyant as the costumes he dons, attire which makes him look like he
could be one of Liberace's dandy acquaintances at a Halloween party.
Elijah sees his role as the mentor who will awaken David to the
potential he has and therefore make the comic book world he lives in
seem more tangible and reaffirm that his sickly birth wasn't a mistake.</P>
<P>The major stumbling block, to this otherwise involving film, is the let
down in the third act. The action in it seemed obligatory and not really
germane to the story, as an anonymous psycho serial killer is introduced
to prove that David has the super-powers of the comic book hero. This
encounter, of him stopping the violent psychopath killer never worked
right, as it seemed flat and arbitrary, spoiling but not ruining the
overall achievement of the film.</P>
<P>What this unconventional mainstream film did right for itself, was to
provide a modern type of super-hero for an audience that thrives on
escapist films that can fill them with some hope that there's a savior
out there in the fight between good and evil (something Hollywood films
could always be counted on to provide the public with). It is a film
that is confident enough of its ability to tell its story that it
doesn't have to rely on special effects. And, perhaps, as an homage to
Hitchcock or maybe it's a case of egomania, Night once again appears in
his own film. I don't think I'm giving anything away when I let you know
he was in a throwaway part, as the one Bruce Willis hassled at the
stadium because he suspected him of being a drug dealer.</P>
