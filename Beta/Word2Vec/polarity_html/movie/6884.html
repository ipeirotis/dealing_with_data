<PRE>                             ALL MEN ARE LIARS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     The Australians have a knack for screwball comedies that are
actually funny.  American filmmakers too often confuse humor with bad
taste.  Writer and director Gerard Lee's 1995 film ALL MEN ARE LIARS
was a box office sensation in Australia.  It is being shown now at film
festivals in the US in hopes of finding a US distributor.  I saw it at
San Jose's Cinequest film festival.</P>
<P>     Since I said it was an Australian comedy, you might leap to the
conclusion that the film was about cross-dressing.  If you did, you'd
be right.  Although it shares a kinship with THE ADVENTURES OF
PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT, it is closer in plot to SOME LIKE IT
HOT and TWELFTH NIGHT and closer in spirit to MURIEL'S WEDDING.</P>
<P>     ALL MEN ARE LIARS is funny, sweet, and romantic.  I'll outline the
main action, but there are more subplots than you can count.  You are
likely to leave the show arguing with your friends about what part was
the best.  Let me state my opinion upfront.  The love story between the
two leads is the most endearing.  Both are wonderful actors, and they
make it is easy for the audience to live their romance vicariously.</P>
<P>     It is Sugar Week in a small-town in the middle of nowhere in
Australia.  Barry (John Jarratt), his older son Mick (David Price) and
his younger son Tom (Jamie Peterson) sing every week at the local pub.
Barry is the town barber and an Elvis wannabe, but don't call him an
impersonator or you might get into a fight.  He worships Elvis.  He
explains that he is an Elvis imitator and that he hates impersonators.
Jarratt has one of the best parts of the film and manages to steal most
of the scenes he is in.</P>
<P>     Barry's wife Irene (Carmen Tanti) has had it with Barry after he
sells her piano.  It is a family heirloom of hers, and if the piano
goes, she goes too.  Other than the delicious in-joke about the piano,
Irene's whole part only serves to slow down the action and should have
been eliminated.  (Gerard Lee is a friend and collaborator of director
Jane Campion, and they wrote the script together for SWEETIE.
Campion's signature film is THE PIANO, so having a piano play a
promenade role in Lee's picture was no accident.  Lee has an
unprintable comment in the press kit for ALL MEN ARE LIARS about what
he does to the piano in the movie.)</P>
<P>     The locals have long since become bored with Barry's singing, so
they book an outside, all-female group for the big celebration week.
Soon after they arrive, the band's lead singer, Angie (Toni Pearen),
finds out that her boyfriend Rick (Cristin Daniel), the band's groupie,
has been having an affair with another band member, Jo (Yvette Konig).
The band's leader and drummer, Courtney (Natasha Riedel), banishes Jo
and Rick.  Courtney is a lesbian, who never trusted men anyway.  Soon
the whole band swears off men since all men are liars.</P>
<P>     Courtney advertises for a woman to replace Jo.  Brother Tom
convinces Mick to become Michelle, and the fun begins.</P>
<P>     You can probably guess the basic structure of the rest of the
story, but the beauty is in the details.  The story has surprise after
surprise.  Most of them are small but delightful, with the best little
scene dominated by Larry, the boys' pet lizard.  The moral of this
vignette is don't take a lizard on a date.</P>
<P>     David Price is terrific as Michelle.  He plays Michelle as
believably and naturally shy.  When Michelle starts falling for Angie,
Angie reciprocates even though she has never been attracted to a woman
before.  Their romance is delightful and innocent -- from the classic
scene where they almost skinny-dip to the one of Michelle changing
clothes off-screen.  Both of the leads are lovable, and the script has
just enough poignancy in it to make you care and worry about them.</P>
<P>     There are some fun musical numbers too.  Toni Pearen is a popular
singer in Australia, and I liked her naturalness much better than the
constant mugging for the camera that was prevalent in a recent
all-musical movie that I endured.  My favorite musical number in the
film has Angie and Barry lip-syncing in his barber shop using electric
clippers as imaginary mikes.</P>
<P>     The script is smart and upbeat.  It works more by its character
development and its joke setups than by its one-liners.  Still, I
remember the line of the local stud.  He makes unwelcome advances on
Michelle and then realizes that she is a he.  The stud's pathetic cry
is, "If I need therapy for this, you're paying for it."</P>
<P>     A show with a great ending, and one that leaves a song in your
heart and a contagious feeling of joy.</P>
<P>     ALL MEN ARE LIARS runs a fast 1:27.  In Australia it was rated PG,
but has not been rated by our MPAA.  I suspect it will get a PG or a
PG-13 rating.  There is a brief shot of rear male nudity, and I think
there may have been a little profanity that I forgot to record in my
notes.  The show should be fine for kids ten and up.  I loved this
little gem and recommend it to you.  I hope and expect they will get an
American distributor soon.  I give the film ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
