<P>     After a stylistic detour with MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE 
(which, despite its uncomfortable tone, was close to being a 
conventional movie), director Alan Rudolph has returned to his unique 
brand of film making with AFTERGLOW, a romantic black comedy about love, 
betrayal, and self-absorption.  While these may not be the most unusual 
themes to fashion into a motion picture, Rudolph's atypical approach to 
the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing, if not 
always pleasant, movie.</P>
<P>     It is said that Rudolph is a polarizing director – meaning that 
most viewers either love his work or hate it.  Until MRS. PARKER, I had 
not been overly impressed by his movies. I found EQUINOX, his last pre-
MRS. PARKER effort, to be irritating and frustrating.  I was somewhat 
surprised, therefore, to discover that I liked AFTERGLOW.  There are 
several reasons for this, but the paramount one is that Rudolph seems to 
have muted some of the most strident, mannered aspects of his approach.  
The characters here are more like real people with genuine problems, the 
story is absorbing, and the acting is top-notch.  In short, Rudolph has 
created a world that it's worth spending two hours in.</P>
<P>     AFTERGLOW introduces us to two unhappily married couples.  Jeffrey 
Byron (Jonny Lee Miller) is a cold, seemingly-heartless businessman who 
is sexually indifferent to his young wife, Marianne (Lara Flynn Boyle).  
For her part, Marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never 
attempts to interact with her husband on a human level.  All she's 
interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's 
ovulating.  After he refuses to make love, she decides to find someone 
else to play the role of sperm donor.</P>
<P>     The other couple, Lucky (Nick Nolte) and Phyllis Mann (Julie 
Christie), are an older pair, but they're no more content than Jeffrey 
and Marianne.  A mysterious fracture in their past relationship has 
driven them apart.  They remain married as a matter of convenience, but, 
since Phyllis won't allow Lucky to touch her, they have an unspoken 
agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that 
no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs.  The 
landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable.</P>
<P>     The four characters begin interacting when Marianne hires Lucky as 
a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with 
Jeffrey.  The two of them are immediately attracted to one another, and 
it doesn't take long before they're lounging together, naked, in her 
pool.  Meanwhile, Jeffrey, who is captivated by older women, runs into 
Phyllis in a hotel bar, is smitten, and invites her to accompany him on 
a weekend retreat to the mountains.</P>
<P>     The romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that 
they illustrate the multiple faces of love.  Sex means something 
different to everyone – to Jeffrey, it's an unpleasant chore, a loss of 
control; to Marianne, it's a means to a maternal end; to Lucky, it's an 
enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles; and to 
Phyllis, it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness.  
Ultimately, none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much 
as they love themselves.  </P>
<P>     The greatest strength of the film lies not in the script, but in 
the performances.  Jonny Lee Miller is perfect as the selfish, callous, 
suit-and-tie businessman.  Those who recall him as Sickboy in 
TRAINSPOTTING will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the 
image of conformity.  Lara Flynn Boyle, who wasn't impressive in 
Rudolph's EQUINOX, is greatly improved, making Marianne a jumble of 
sexiness and vulnerability.  Nick Nolte is delightful as the uninhibited 
Lucky, and he manages to deliver some of Rudolph's most pregnant lines 
with practiced ease.  The clear standout, however, is Julie Christie, 
who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary Phyllis.  Her often 
wry, occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's 
humor, and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the 
spotlight from her co-stars.</P>
<P>     I don't know if AFTERGLOW is the film to convert Rudolph-
detractors, but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible 
than some of the director's earlier productions.  Enough of his 
trademark style remains, however, to reassure his supporters.  AFTERGLOW 
is basically a four-pronged character study.  The plot is not especially 
compelling, but the character interaction is, and that's the real reason 
to see this motion picture.  Rudolph has painted an able picture of the 
non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance 
and familiarity than with affection and attraction.</P>
