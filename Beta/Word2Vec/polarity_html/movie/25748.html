<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This might be the best junkie film ever made. It is set in Iowa in the
1970s and follows the observations of a young screw up, who gets the
ignominious nickname of Fuckhead (Billy Crudup), a name which he comes
to accept as it sticks with him. The New Zealander, Alison Maclean
(Crush), directed Denis Johnson's book of short dramatic stories with a
sharp eye for comedy, where the addiction story plays second fiddle to
the overall psychological problems of the addict.</P>
<P>The film has its protagonist go from one adventure to another as he
tries to make sense of his messed up life, in each episode he meets up
with different offbeat characters and continues to find himself lost in
this dark world of his own stupidity, where he goes from a morbid
dreamer, to a drug addict and thief, and finally to a savior. Billy
Crudup is simply ingenious in this sterling role as the poetic voice of
the author, making the internal musings of Denis Johnson's disjointed
surreal stories come to life, not quite like in the book, but in its own
cinematic way. That this impossible book was adapted to the screen, is a
minor miracle itself, though it is certainly not a fault-free film, as
it petered out toward the end from sluggishness. But if viewed as a
story that doesn't have to make too much sense, because a junky' life
doesn't make too much sense anyway, then the film can be savored for its
fair quota of highs. This film easily takes in scenes with characters
who leave the film just as quickly as they entered it, with the only
constant in the story being Crudup, who keeps everything in order by his
continuous voiceover. The film is divided into chapter headings, which
are flashed onscreen, as FH rants on like the stoned out freak he is.</P>
<P>This episodic adventure of the irresponsible FH, who is lost and
undisciplined, begins on the rainy highway where he is hitching a ride
to see if he can get back together with Michelle (Samantha Morton). The
story goes into the flashback mode as FH tells what happened to him
three years ago in the early 1970s and how he met the love of his life,
the frizzled haired Michelle, who looks sexy walking around in her
bikini panties. She is a heroin addict he meets when a guy who fell
asleep in his VW takes him to a house party. The only problem he has, is
that she is seeing another guy named McInnes (Ventimiglia). He is the
one who gives FH his illustrious name, as he sees him kissing his girl
at the party. But soon Dundun (Shannon) shoots McInnes in the stomach
and he dies before the reluctant Dundun is talked into getting him to
the hospital. Dundun gets FH's help to dump the body in a cornfield.</P>
<P>Michelle's relationship with the innocent but not-so-innocent FH becomes
a live-in one, where we watch the couple casually shoot heroin,
something she gets him started in, while the TV plays cartoons in the
background. FH is totally oblivious to things around him, serenely
eating Frosted Flakes, as he is too self-absorbed to know what he is
doing or where he is at.</P>
<P>One of the more hysterical scenes, is when he converses with his morose
cowboy friend Wayne (Leary) in a bar, and Wayne takes him to salvage his
abandoned home for scrap wires and plumbing fixtures, as they get enough
money to score some heroin and return to the bar and get loaded. There
might be some unintentional moral to the story at this point, as they
both take the heroin but Wayne keels over dead from it.</P>
<P>The funniest chapter from the book, is the scene where he is working as
an orderly in the hospital's emergency room. His partner orderly is the
zany Georgie (Jack Black), who robs the dispensary of all kinds of
pills, which they both pop to help them get through the long night. The
comedy becomes "Pulp Fiction"-like when the two of them treat a man who
comes in with a knife stuck in his eye socket, and then go for a car
ride to unwind in the snowy winter night, as they decide to camp out in
the wilderness and live off the land.</P>
<P>The most dramatic scene comes when Michelle is pregnant and he takes her
to a Chicago abortion clinic, which has pro-life demonstrators in front
of the clinic. The two fight over nothing and their blankness to life
gets the better of them, as they part company. She soon goes to Mexico
with an unappealing man called John Smith.</P>
<P>The film returns from the flashback mode at this point and we see him
hitchhike to Michelle's new place, where the two of them try to get back
together, which will have disastrous results. FH then ends up alone in
Arizona to kick his addiction problems. Here -- FH becomes involved with
many things; such as, staring through the window of a Menonite
housewife's home because he is enchanted by her spiritual singing;
having an absurd conversation with a fellow patient (Dennis Hopper) who
has a few bullet holes in him, as they reside in a rehab clinic; having
a sexual relationship with a hard luck member of his support group
(Holly Hunter), whose three husbands died.</P>
<P>FH finds his salvation when he ends up working in a nursing home as an
editor for a newspaper about the residence, who are disturbed and
disabled patients. Here, he learns how to touch these patients, who are
even more messed up in life than he is because of their infirmaries. He
drily says that the God who created this mess must be some madman.</P>
<P>"Jesus' Son," a title snatched from a Lou Reed song, has many glorious
moments of dry humor, pungency, sadness and unpredictability; it
exhibits the rare quality all special films have, it requires some
effort to see what the film is about, and though it is a likable film,
it does not aim to please its audience. It is a film that zig-zags all
over the map, with its target being pop culture in America and how one
survivor of the drug culture, who is so disarming and real, will have
his maddening story breathe life into his messed up junkie veins and
give vent to dreams he has that are as relevant as any genuine religious
experience.</P>
