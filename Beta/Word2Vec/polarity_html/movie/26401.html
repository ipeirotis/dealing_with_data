A SCENE AT THE SEA (Ano natsu, ichiban shizukana umi)
(director/writer/editor: Takeshi Kitano; cinematographer: Katsumi
Yanagishima; cast: Kuroko Maki (Shigeru), Hiroko Oshima (Takako);
Runtime:101; Kimstim Pictures; 1992-Japan)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An unusual film from the always interesting director Takeshi Kitano
(Fireworks/Violent Cop/Sonatine), taking an entirely different direction
than the violent gangster films he is renown for. This is a very
sensitive love story about a young couple who are both deaf. The
dialogue is almost completely muted, as there are long stretches of
golden silences and no translators for the deaf are used or needed to
make things understood. The couple communicates by their expressions,
rarely using sign language. It is a most compelling and unique film, one
that is emotionally satisfying, on a level of a Bresson film for its
sparseness and the emotional connections it makes with the viewers.</P>
<P>Shigeru (Kuroko Maki) works as a garbageman. On one of his rounds he
finds a broken surfboard and takes it home to repair. He knows nothing
about surfing, but he goes with his moonfaced girlfriend Takako (Hiroko
Oshima) surfing. They go to a spot where a regular crowd of surfers
hang-out, and while Shigeru is learning, the others laugh at his
inexperience and lack of proper equipment, he doesn't even possess a
wetsuit. When his surfboard breaks, he goes to a sports store and
bargains to get a good board. Not having enough money, he waits until
payday and goes back to the same store to buy the board. He could have
gotten a cheaper board somewhere else, but it turns out that he bought
it at the right store. The store-owner is a champion surfer and takes an
interest in him, going down to watch him surf and give him pointers.
Slowly the boy begins to improve and add equipment, he also grows with
confidence.</P>
<P>There are some splendid scenes where we view him at a surfing contest,
the Chikura Surf Classics. None of his local group bother to tell him
that they announced his name when he is called, and he misses the
contest, while his group is chided for this by the store-owner.</P>
<P>We view him walk in a noble manner to the surfing area with his
girlfriend and follow with curiosity how she temporarily withdraws from
him, as her jealousy arises when she sees him sitting with another girl.</P>
<P>The film forces one to view it the way a deaf person sees the world.
There is little need for dialogue to convey its story, for what is
clearly shown is how human nature can be understood by deaf people, that
one does not need language to express how people cling to groups and
glorify their own exclusiveness. The film always has a light strain of
humor running through it, yet what remains memorable, is how beautiful
the summer scenery is and how effectively simple the story is, molded
together in a very discriminating way while presenting a very touching
love story. This is a cinema fans true delight, a purely visual film
without the need for high-tech artifices.</P>
