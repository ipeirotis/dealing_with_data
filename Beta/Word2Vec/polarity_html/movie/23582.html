<P>     After enduring FINAL DESTINATION, I have a renewed appreciation for
David Duchovny. I've always found his work on "The X-Files" to be plenty
entertaining, but I never realized how integral his performance as Fox
"Spooky" Mulder was to the success of the show. Duchovny has one of the
most thankless jobs on television: He spends a fair portion of every
single episode spitting out ridiculous speculative exposition. Mulder's
leaps of logic make him the Bob Beamon of investigative analysis; it is
only because Duchovny plays his dialogue with a strange combination of
confidence and deadpan resignation that you don't want to throw something
at the screen every time Mulder zigs from the Point A of "victim with cut
throat" to the Point Z of "werewolf on the prowl."</P>
<P>     Glen Morgan and James Wong have been part of the "X-Files" creative
team since day one, and have been key players in some of the series' best
episodes (including "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"). They've teamed
up for another wild supernatural premise in FINAL DESTINATION, but instead
of David Duchovny they have ... Devon Sawa. Sawa plays Alex Browning, a
high school senior looking forward to a class trip to Paris. While sitting
in the plane waiting to take off, however, he has a powerful premonition
of a mid-air disaster. Alex and several classmates are forced to leave the
plane in the ensuing panic-induced disruption, and consequently become the
only survivors when the disaster does come to pass. They all face a
mixture of relief and survivor guilt, but Alex has an even stranger
reaction. After one of the survivors meets a strange demise, he becomes
convinced that they were all meant to die on that plane, and that Death
itself may be stalking those who cheated it.</P>
<P>     Exactly how Alex becomes convinced is a huge part of the problem. 
Essentially, Alex accepts the rantings of a creepy mortician (erstwhile
Candyman Tony Todd) after he and fellow survivor/pseudo romantic interest
Clear (Ali Larter) break into a funeral home. The mortician expounds at
length on how Death might take exception to having its victims slip
through its fingers, and Alex instantly begins formulating a survival
strategy based on these wild speculations. Characters like the mortician 
are commonplace in supernatural horror films -- the protagonist has to
have some expert from whom to learn the rules of the strange game he finds
himself playing -- but this particular character is a ridiculous
contrivance. Alex finds an expert on Death's psyche just when he needs
one, never questioning for a second the credentials of an undertaker for
knowing the behaviors that get Death miffed.</P>
<P>     It doesn't help that Sawa doesn't exactly act the heck out of the
part. An earlier incarnation of the story by Jeffrey Reddick featured
adults as the survivors, before New Line, Wong and Morgan turned it into
an adolescent-centered shocker. The performers are generally functional at
best -- Chad E. Donella, himself an "X-Files" veteran as this season's
tormented brain-sucker, is a notable exception -- but it's the tragic
combination of Sawa and the script that sinks the film. The rules Alex
intuits for Death's modus operandi -- taking the survivors in the order
they were meant to die in the plane crash, skipping victims when someone
intervenes, etc. -- are convoluted at best. With Sawa dispensing those
rules to the audience, they're laughable. A more seasoned actor might have
made something of Alex's ever-more-obsessive interest in figuring out the
workings of fate. Sawa fumbles and flounders, lacking the least shred of
what Duchovny brings to similarly exaggerated material.</P>
<P>     Critics and viewers have learned not to expect much from horror films
heavy on teen cast members, even those with potentially promising 
pedigrees (e.g. the work of another "X-Files" alum, David Nutter's
DISTURBING BEHAVIOR). Still, you want to believe that talented people can
take a unique premise and give it a jolt of creativity. Wong brings
plenty of visual style to the table, and long-time writing partners Wong
and Morgan have fun nodding to their thriller forebears (characters named
after Hitchcock, Browning, Val Lewton and even their "X-Files" boss Chris
Carter) and selecting John Denver's "Rocky Mountain High" as the harbinger
of the Grim Reaper. They're just missing one crucial piece: a lead actor
who knows how to play the patently absurd with a wink and a shiver. FINAL
DESTINATION is left to play around with Rube Goldberg deathtraps, fatally
bereft of anyone who can take the silly and make it Spooky.</P>
