<P>     It's not often that a film inspires me to use the adjective
"sublime," but there's no better word to describe what Atom Egoyan has
accomplished in THE SWEET HEREAFTER.  Most films about tragic subjects
appear to be driven by a fear that emotions writ small will leave an
audience hungry for grand catharsis, so they attack with teary-eyed
embraces and a swelling John Williams score.  Egoyan refuses to turn on a
warning light when he's about to go for your emotions.  When he does, he
catches them almost as unguarded as the emotions of his characters.</P>
<P>     No other approach could have worked the same mournful, hypnotic
magic Egoyan delivers in THE SWEET HEREAFTER.  The setting is a small town
in British Columbia devastated by a school bus accident which claimed the
lives of twenty children.  Into the still shell-shocked town steps
Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm), an attorney who wants to represent the
children's parents in a civil negligence suit.  Many of the parents
respond to Stephens and come on board quickly.  Others, like Billy Ansel
(Bruce Greenwood), want nothing to do with Stephens.  After all, he's just
an ambulance-chaser preying on the community's need for someone to hold
accountable for their pain.  Isn't he?</P>
<P>     Well, like most things in Atom Egoyan films, the obvious answer
usually isn't the right one.  Through a masterful use of overlapping and
interwoven time frames, Egoyan gradually reveals details about the
characters which cloud every motivation.  Stephens, we learn, is tormented
by the fate of his own daughter Zoe (Caerthan Banks), a drug addict who
contacts him only when desperate for money.  The roles of other characters
in the story also unfold in bits and pieces:  Nicole (Sarah Polley), a
teen-aged survivor of the crash; Dolores Driscoll (Gabrielle Rose), the
bus driver who can't help speaking of some of the victims in the present
tense; Nicole's father Sam (Tom McCamus); Billy and married motel manager
Risa (Alberta Watson).  Egoyan's story-telling demands that you pay
attention, forces you to draw conclusions, and allows you to feel without
telling you _how_ to feel.</P>
<P>     He's also a director who can startle you with his confident refusals
to make the obvious choice.  Nowhere is this more evident than his
depiction of the bus accident itself.  The moment is gripping and
devastating in a completely unpredictable way because of what we see, what
we don't see, and the context in which it is framed.  The scene becomes a
shocking and indelible image of parental helplessness, as does Ian Holm's
bravura monologue in which Stephens describes a medical emergency which
threatens Zoe's life as an infant.  Egoyan portrays the deep, powerful and
often illogical emotions of parenthood from several different
perspectives, each one performed to perfection, each one with different
wrenching consequences.</P>
<P>     One of Egoyan's riskier choices is also one of the few which doesn't
pay off.  Several scenes in THE SWEET HEREAFTER are accompanied by Nicole
reading passages from "The Pied Piper of Hamelin," an extended metaphor
which grows less effective each time it's used.  On screen, with the
persistence of a voice, the comparison occasionally feels forced; I can
imagine the device working much more effectively in the Russell Banks
novel on which the film is based (and which I haven't read), as an entry
or exit point to a chapter.  THE SWEET HEREAFTER is still a remarkably
literary film in the best sense of the word, perhaps the most novel-like
film since John Sayles' LONE STAR.  What Egoyan adds cinematically -- from
Mychael Danna's otherworldly score to the ambiguity-enhancing final shot
-- turns THE SWEET HEREAFTER into one of the year's most powerful works.
And, in all probability, the most sublime.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 hereafter-glows:  9.     </PRE>
