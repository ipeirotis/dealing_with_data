<PRE>Starship Troopers (R)  0 out of 5.</PRE>
<P>Starship Troopers is a bad movie.  I mean, a really, really, bad movie.  Not
only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood, gore and
body parts shown on the screen, it blissfully jumps over that line,
apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to
fifteen year olds (of which I saw many in the theatre).  Looking past the
appalling sight of overdone violence, we are left with a movie with a thin
plot at best, no strong lead characters, a blatant disregard for physics,
and a very obvious Naziesque theme.  That being said, onto the review:
The movie starts with a propaganda message from the Federation (who's logo
bears a *STRONG* resemblance to a Nazi German Eagle), urging the populace to
go off and fight the bugs, who are attempting to destroy earth.  The film
shows large rallies with young children in attendance, pledging allegiance
to the federation (again, sound familiar?).  As the movie progresses, we are
shown terror tactic training, as a drill sargeant very graphically compound
fractures one recruits arm, and throws a knife through another's hand.
Eventually, the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the
way across the Milky Way galaxy, to fight the bugs on their home planet.  As
our faster than light travelling "heroes" arrive on planet, they drop onto
the planet, and burst our of their craft brandishing... "What?" you say,
"Laser Beam weapons?  Sonic Weapons?  Phasers?  Photon Cannons?".  Nope,
they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns, pump action rifles, and
tactical nuclear weapons!  I guess a lot of physics money R&D went into
travel and not weaponry.  As the assault begins, our group of troopers are
seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon.  Two members of the
group notice rocks slipping and falling above them, and one even sees a
streak fly by, but disregards it as nothing.  This of course, leads to more
massive carnage, blood shed, and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being
ripped and severed from their bodies.  Again, I see that military tactics in
the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons!  In
the end, we see Neil Patrick "Doogie Howser" Harris burst onto the scene in
what could accurately be described as a Nazi SS trenchcoat, hat, and gloves.
He does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug, and then proclaims that the
bugs are scared!  This sets the troopers into a frenzy, as they are now one
step closer to completing their goal, total genocide of a species (again,
sound familiar??).
I have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review,
but given  it's non-existence, I may have anyway.  I could go on for pages
ripping this movie apart, but don't want to bore you too badly.</P>
<P>In short, I felt as if I were subjected to a mix between a pro-Nazi war film
with bugs substituted for allies, a drivers education accident scene film,
and a complete blank screen (the plot, of course).  I wouldn't recommend
this movie to anyone, anywhere, under any circumstance.
