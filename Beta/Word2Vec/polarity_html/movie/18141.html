<P>LADIES ON THE ROCKS  (director: Christian Braad Thomsen; cast:
Anne Marie Helger (Laura), Helle Ryslinge (Micha), Flemming Quist Møller
(Leonard), Hans Henrik Clemensen (Hans-Henrik), 1983-Denmark)</P>
<P>The two girls, probably in their mid-twenties, Micha (Ryslinge) and
Laura (Helger), have a variety revue act, which they named "Ladies
Trip", where they do comic skits with strong sexual innuendoes and some
song numbers in various nightclubs, bars, and meeting halls across
Denmark.</P>
<P>Micha is single and disillusioned with her wry circumstances, feeling
that life has dealt her some bad cards to play with, as her life is a
game of losing hands. She is looking for something more romantic in her
life and can't find it in the men she goes out with. Leonard (Møller) is
her rock and roll musician boyfriend who likes her because she is a good
bang but finds he has nothing else in common with her, treating her with
disrespect and coldness, overtly showing her that he doesn't give one
rap about her, and making no bones about it. She feels like an addict
who is addicted sexually to this guy that she knows is no good for her
and can't do anything to get him out of her system, while hating herself
for being as weak-minded about it as she is. Laura, on the other hand,
is in an upper-class marriage, living a very comfortable existence with
her stable business executive husband and two sweet daughters. Her
husband treats her act as a hobby, and seems to offer her all the
creature comforts of what an ideal nuclear family should have.
Appearance-wise, she seems to have it all in her favor.</P>
<P>We soon see Micha and Laura preparing to go on a long tour with their
act, with Micha almost out-of-her head with rage that Leonard stood her
up for another girl, swearing she never wants to see him again, while
Laura breathes a sigh of relief that she has escaped for a bit from the
stuffy existence she has, though she is none too happy about Micha being
on such a downer to start their tour, telling her to put that bad stuff
out of her mind, that this is our trip.</P>
<P>This is fundamentally a feminist oriented road movie without the
politics of the movement playing a part in the story, as the film is
steeped in personal irony over abandonment of loved ones and fantasies
that can't become real, without any particular message to deliver,
except that these two have their hands full coping with their life, as
it seems, it is only by their humor and forceful spirit that they can
manage to survive.</P>
<P>On their first stop, they give a bawdy performance in the library and
are then asked to stay after and answer questions from the audience.
Since they consider themselves artists, they feel their act speaks for
itself and are particularly upset at being blind sided by one hostile
viewer of their show, an overweight lady who feels that they made fun of
how obese women look in their act and she felt they did a disservice to
women who have that problem, as she upsets them as she rails at them
before walking out.</P>
<P>The remainder of the film takes place on the road, emphasizing how the
girls relate to each other: from their girl talk and gossipy chatter and
need to let off steam from all the anger that builds up in them, to
their ever-demanding personal lives, as Micha is still hard-pressed to
find a true romantic relationship and Laura is confused about who she
is.</P>
<P>Micha angrily questions the bourgeois patrons who invite them for an
after-the-show snack, how they can justify making most of the money off
their work and look down upon them with a snobbish attitude, while they
just scrape by on a minimal amount of money even though they do all the
hard work. Laura has retreated to the basement with their patron's
elderly father who has a tremendous passion for trains and runs his
model trains to imitate the Danish train system, even to the point of
its lateness of schedule. Since the family treats him as someone not to
be taken seriously, yet it is quite evident, that he, alone, has a real
love for something that the bourgeois in his family just don't have.</P>
<P>We see how tough the road is for the girls, as they make toast on their
hotel's radiator, and how they bring a piss pail along with them because
some of the places they play at don't have bathrooms, and we see how
uncomfortable they feel, always on the move and always cast as outsiders
who feel alienated from the locals.</P>
<P>What comes across very lucidly, is how others look upon them so much
reflects the attitudes they come away with, as their comic act begins to
get more bitter and more sexually revealing, as their lives begin
spinning out of control, though their act is working and they are
playing to mostly sold-out houses.</P>
<P>When Hans-Henrik (Clemensen), the very middle-class husband of Laura
catches one of their out-of -town shows and takes Laura out to eat in a
fancy restaurant she is most uncomfortable in, their relationship is at
last shown to be the sham it is, as he questions the explicit sexual
kinkiness of her act and the lowbrow humor it arouses, ashamed if any
one in his office would see a wife of his in such a third-rate show.</P>
<P>On the road, the filmmaker brings out the opinions the various sort of
people the girls meet have of performers and, especially, female ones
out on their own. A chocolate salesman tells them every one is an actor
trying to sell their product, but the important thing is, if you try
hard enough people will forgive you for what you are lacking or might
not even notice it. That his gimmick is to get the children to eat the
chocolate first, then the parents are delighted that the kids like the
chocolate, so his sale becomes an easy one. He fails miserbly when he
tries to seduce Micha, which should tell you what the filmmaker thinks
of his approach to life. A bartender tells them the last time he was at
a show was 20 years ago, and he walked out at intermission. The girls
innocently tell him that they don't have intermissions during their
shows.</P>
<P>It is hard to say for sure what the film is crying out to say from all
the self-discoveries that keep happening to the girls, as their act
grows despite- and- because of their personal failures, and as Laura
gets divorced and the kids become showbiz kids travelling with the act,
and Micha is stuck with the problem she always has, she can't find Mr.
Right.</P>
<P>It seems as if the women are disgruntled that men have let them down,
and that their life has turned into a series of one-night stands.
Though, what stands out, is the marvelously genuine performances of the
heroines of the story and how appealing they were in such a troublesome
way, that there public appearance might seem calm and collected, but
behind the scenes they are being gnawed at by all the chaos in their
life.</P>
<P>This thought provoking film, touched many different themes with equal
breath and veracity, but this also highlighted its most glaring
weakness, that it couldn't focus in on any one theme completely, as it
mostly questioned middle-class values and the need for a person to find
a way to express themselves enthusiastically, pointing out that maybe,
that is all one can hope for, yet leaving so many other things
unanswered that it brought up, that you could write your own movie from
all that was left unsaid that remains speculative about the girls and
their situation.</P>
<P>Ultimately, the road itself must be considered the goal of the trip, and
this engaging film allows you to feel the pains of the girls who are
still searching for their own identities; but strangely enough, even as
the film ends with the weary girls wondering what's next, as they finish
their act and are sitting where the audience sat moments before, you get
the feeling that things will somehow or other work out for them, that
these are some pretty toughened and likable characters, and they have
left a good impression with the audience, which is why their act had so
many sell-outs and why they should be pleasing to the audience that sees
them on film, except this audience has to look at the girl's a bit
deeper knowing all the disappointments and discomforts they have gone
through, and I don't know if there is a mass audience out there willing
to see things that are harder to look at, without feeling remiss about
what they are seeing.</P>
