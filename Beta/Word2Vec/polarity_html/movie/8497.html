<P>     It's dark, dank, and gloomy.  The human survivors are trapped, 
prisoners in a structure from which all the escape routes have been cut 
off.  The enemy, nightmarish creations of some special effects creature 
workshop, are closing in slowly but inexorably.  One-by-one, the valiant 
heroes are picked off, several of them giving their lives so that their 
compatriots will have a better opportunity to survive. </P>
<P>     What I have just described is the premise of James Cameron's 
action/science fiction classic, ALIENS.  Without much alteration, it is 
also the premise of MIMIC, the newest release from Miramax's horror 
label, Dimension Films.  In fact, the title of this motion picture is 
quite apt -- MIMIC does an excellent job of imitating not only ALIENS, 
but several other science fiction and horror features, including such 
odd choices as LEVIATHAN and THE THING.  The derivative result is, as 
one might expect, moderately entertaining, but far from groundbreaking 
in its approach or execution.</P>
<P>     What's perhaps surprising about this film is the quantity and 
quality of ability involved.  On the acting side, two Academy Awards are 
represented (F. Murray Abraham and Mira Sorvino), in addition to the 
recognized talents of Charles Dutton, Jeremy Northam, and Giancarlo 
Giannini.  The director is Guillermo Del Toro, who reinvented the 
vampire legend with his critically-acclaimed Mexican horror film, 
CRONOS.  The script includes contributions from two indie giants, John 
Sayles and Stephen Soderbergh.  With so many luminaries involved, 
therefore, it's a bit of a disappointment that MIMIC is so... ordinary.</P>
<P>     The most interesting aspect of the film is probably the backstory 
that sets up the "bug hunt."  This postulates that a devastating disease 
has stricken New York City.  One by one, children are dying, and there's 
no end in sight.  An etymologist by the name of Susan Tyler (Mira 
Sorvino) determines that the disease is being spread by cockroaches.  In 
order to save thousands of lives, she heads a team of experts to 
genetically engineer a vicious-looking insect called the "Judas Breed" 
that is designed to kill the roaches.  As developed in the lab, it is 
infertile and has a six-month life cycle.  Tyler's team releases their 
creations onto the streets, the cockroaches are killed, and the disease 
is eradicated.  All is calm, but only for three years.  Then Tyler 
learns John Hammond's lesson from JURASSIC PARK -- supposed sterility 
isn't the definitive way of stopping procreation.  The entire species of 
Judas Breed did not die out when it was supposed to.  Mutated and 
evolved, the creatures now haunt the subways of New York city, awaiting 
an opportunity to swarm.  Along with her husband, Peter (Jeremy 
Northam), a cop (Charles Dutton), and a concerned grandfather (Giancarlo 
Giannini), Tyler must venture into the dark, dangerous depths of New 
York's underground world to confront what her Judas Breed has become.</P>
<P>     All of this is background, however.  MIMIC's centerpiece is the 
survival game played out between humans and giant insects, and, while 
it's marked with moments of tension, the film is a little too familiar 
to get the adrenaline flowing.  Del Toro is masterful at creating 
atmosphere, but there's only so far that can take a film, and the plot 
isn't strong enough to elevate the proceedings to a higher level.  Most 
of MIMIC's true scares are of the obvious variety -- those that are 
enhanced by sudden surges of music.  In fact, it has been a while since 
a movie has really given me the creeps, and this one doesn't change 
that.</P>
<P>     Mira Sorvino seems miscast as the brainy, no-nonsense Dr. Tyler.  
Maybe the problem is that she's so good at playing bimbos (as in MIGHTY 
APHRODITE and ROMY AND MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION) that it's hard to 
accept her as an egghead.  More successful is Jeremy Northam as Susan's 
husband, the deputy director of the Center for Disease Control.  
Giancarlo Giannini is a pleasant addition to the cast, even if an early 
subplot involving his relationship with his grandson (Alexander Goodwin) 
is dragged out.  F. Murray Abraham is on hand in a small role as "the 
voice of wisdom."  The real star of MIMIC, however, is Charles Dutton, 
who plays a NYC cop with the kind of gusto that makes him the most real 
and likable member of the group.</P>
<P>     With MIMIC, Miramax is probably hoping to reproduce the success of 
last year's SCREAM, the highest-grossing horror movie of all time.  
However, while this atmosphere-drenched film offers a few shocks, it 
lacks the knowing wit and genuine scariness of Wes Craven's 1996 
offering.  In essence, MIMIC is a B movie with an A-grade cast and 
production team.  And that may be all you need to know to determine 
whether or not this is your kind of flick.</P>
