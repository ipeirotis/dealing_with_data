<P>     Move over, Jane Austen.  Even with all the SENSE AND SENSIBILITYs, 
PRIDE AND PREJUDICEs, and EMMAs, the 19th century author is about to be 
passed by someone older and better-known:  William Shakespeare.  With 
the new influx of play-to-film adaptations, the market is absorbing no 
less than six Shakespeare films in thirteen months.  It started with 
late 1995's OTHELLO and RICHARD III, and will now continue with LOOKING 
FOR RICHARD, TWELFTH NIGHT, ROMEO AND JULIET, and, in late December, 
Kenneth Branagh's much-anticipated HAMLET.  </P>
<P>     With TWELFTH NIGHT, director Trevor Nunn (LADY JANE) follows in 
Branagh's footsteps by adapting one of the comedies for the screen.  
However, while this picture doesn't have quite the same level of style 
or energy evident in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, solid performances and a 
lucid interpretation keep it afloat.  And, because cuts have been made 
sparingly, this is one of the most faithful (at least as far as 
completeness is concerned) of the recent Shakespeare movies.</P>
<P>     For some bizarre reason, Fine Line Features has decided to compare 
TWELFTH NIGHT to THE BIRDCAGE, THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, and TO WONG 
FOO, when about the only element all four have in common is cross-
dressing.  Anyone going into a British adaptation of Shakespeare 
expecting to see Nathan Lane cavorting around in drag is in for a rude 
surprise.  That being said, however, at least TWELFTH NIGHT hasn't 
suffered from cinematic overexposure.  None of the other filmed versions 
of this play are especially well-known.</P>
<P>     TWELFTH NIGHT opens with a scene alluded to, but never presented in 
the original text.  Twin siblings, Viola (Imogen Stubbs) and Sebastian 
(Steven Mackintosh), are aboard a ship that is wrecked off the coast of 
the imaginary country of Illyria.  Although both characters escape the 
disaster, they are separated, and each believes the other to be dead.  
In order to survive more easily in a "man's world", Viola cuts her hair, 
glues on a fake mustache, and dresses in men's clothing.  Going by the 
name of Cesario, she enters the service of a local Duke, Orsino (Toby 
Stephens).  Orsino is madly in love with a young countess, Olivia 
(Helena Bonham Carter), who steadfastly refuses his advances.  Orsino 
sends Viola to woo Olivia in his name.  Olivia immediately falls for 
Viola/Cesario, while, at the same time, Viola realizes that she is in 
love with Orsino.  And so the triangle is established.</P>
<P>     A secondary story concerns the goings-on in Olivia's household, 
where the countess' frequently-drunk uncle, Sir Toby Belch (Mel Smith); 
her maid, Maria (Imelda Staunton); a foppish noble, Sir Andrew Aguecheek 
(Richard E. Grant); and an itinerant entertainer, Feste (Ben Kingsley), 
plot the downfall of Olivia's bad-tempered steward, Malvolio (Nigel 
Hawthorne).</P>
<P>     TWELFTH NIGHT is chiefly about the similarities and differences 
between the sexes.  By dressing Viola as a man, Shakespeare establishes 
an opportunity to explore through one character the different manners in 
which men and women approach the same situation, especially if it 
involves love.  The play also addresses the deceptiveness of judging by 
appearance.  After all, appearance, especially as it relates to 
identity, is an important aspect of TWELFTH NIGHT.</P>
<P>     Veteran stage director Trevor Nunn, who spent more than two decades 
with the Royal Shakespeare Company, has attempted to modernize the play 
without changing its meaning.  The era has been shifted from the 1600s 
to the 1800s, and, using the vibrant Cornish countryside, Nunn has 
opened up the previously-stagebound tale.  Also, through glances and 
actions, the director brings the gay and lesbian subtext a little more 
out of the closet.  </P>
<P>     With TWELFTH NIGHT, as with any of the Bard's comedies, there's 
always a question of how well the humor will translate to a modern 
audience.  Fortunately, in large part due to a wonderful comic turn by 
Nigel Hawthorne, the film offers plenty to laugh at.  The finale, where 
all the mistaken identities are unraveled, is an example of how perfect 
timing can accentuate comedy.</P>
<P>     The cast includes a number of accomplished performers, only three 
of whom -- Helena Bonham Carter (MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN), Nigel 
Hawthorne (THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE), and Ben Kingsley (GANDHI) -- are 
likely to be recognized by the majority of American movie-goers.  Bonham 
Carter, who is well-suited to comedy, sparkles, as does Imogen Stubbs 
(SENSE AND SENSIBILITY).  Mel Smith is delightfully boisterous as the 
drunk and disorderly Sir Toby.  The real standout, however, is 
Hawthorne, whose version of Malvolio can alternately provoke laughter 
and tug at the heart strings.</P>
<P>     Shakespeare aficionados will probably be pleased that so much of 
the written word has made it to the screen, but the two-plus hour 
running length is a bit burdensome.  Branagh's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING 
can be criticized in many areas, but one of its great strengths is 
pacing -- a trait not shared by TWELFTH NIGHT, whose best comic moments 
all occur past the half-way point.  Nevertheless, the slow spots are 
worth sitting through, because, as a whole, this is solid entertainment.</P>
