<PRE>                              CIRCLE OF FRIENDS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Chris O'Donnell, Minnie Driver, Geraldine O'Rawe,
           Saffron Burrows, Alan Cumming, Colin Firth.
Screenplay:  Andrew Davies.
Director:  Pat O'Connor.</P>
<P>     Maybe it's just a matter of perception, but movies seem to come
out in thematic waves.  1994 was widely noted as the year of the
simpleton, with both dramas (NELL, FORREST GUMP) and comedies
(AIRHEADS, DUMB AND DUMBER) focusing on those with social or
intellectual handicaps.  1995 may well turn out to be the year of
the Celt, with John Sayles' THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH already in
theaters and the highland adventures BRAVEHEART and ROB ROY due this
summer.  Between them comes a small Irish coming-of-age tale called
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS.  Though it occasionally loses sight of its
strongest elements, CIRCLE OF FRIENDS is mostly a warm, charming and
insightful little romance, buoyed by a delightful performance from
fresh face Minnie Driver.</P>
<P>     CIRCLE OF FRIENDS takes place in 1957 Ireland, where lifelong pals
Bernadette "Benny" Hogan (Minnie Driver) and Eve Malone (Geraldine
O'Rawe) are preparing to leave their small home town of Knockglen to
attend the University of Dublin.  There they re-connect with Nan Mahan
(Saffron Burrows), an old schoolmate who had moved years earlier.
Their lessons come both inside the lecture halls--where their
traditional Catholic upbringing and morals are challenged--and
outside.  All three friends seek to reconcile their religious beliefs
with their newfound romances, particularly the repressed Benny, who
falls hard for Jack Foley (Chris O'Donnell), the school's handsome
rugby star.  Nan, meanwhile, has designs on marrying into the wealthy
family of Englishman Simon Westward (Colin Firth).</P>
<P>     Based on a novel by Maeve Binchy, CIRCLE OF FRIENDS is mostly
about the struggle between holiness and hormones, about three young
women whose growing curiosity about sexuality collides with the
Catholic Church's pillars of "guilt and shame ... and fear" as defined
by their anthropology professor.  When Benny is the focal point of
this exploration, CIRCLE OF FRIENDS is an unqualified joy.  She is
the most introverted of the three when the story begins, an
over-protected only child required by her parents to commute to the
university while living at home, and targeted for a business-based
arranged marriage with her father's slimy employee Sean (Alan
Cumming).  However, as her relationship with Jack blossoms, so does
Benny.  Minnie Driver is enchanting as Benny, a shining if
unconventional beauty with a sharp mind and a keen sense of herself.
Her growth is thoroughly convincing because she neither begins nor
ends as an extreme; hers is a slow but noticeable growth from girl
into woman.</P>
<P>     CIRCLE OF FRIENDS is also interesting because the romance
between Benny and Jack develops in an unconventional way.  This is
not some John Hughes-like story where the wallflower suddenly wins
over the socialite at the end, because Jack in his own way is as
confused as Benny is, making their friendship and affection for each
other completely natural.  Chris O'Donnell's Irish accent slips here
and there, but mostly his is a very relaxed and confident
performance as a pretty boy lacking in confidence.  The scenes
between Driver and O'Donnell are the film's highlights, particularly
an uncomfortable little exchange in which they ask each other about
their previous sexual experiences.</P>
<P>     The primary problem with CIRCLE OF FRIENDS is that when the
story isn't focusing on Benny, it is more melodramatic and far less
enjoyable.  Too much time is spent on Nan's carefully planned
attempts to land a rich husband, and the rather melodramatic plot
developments which accompany those attempts work against the simple
believability of Benny's story.  Saffron Burrows is also rather dull
as the beautiful Nan, and for as much time as we spend with her
character, her motivations are never really clear.  Similarly
distracting is the sub-plot concerning Sean (played to low-life
perfection, however, by Alan Cumming) and his wheelings and dealings
with Benny's family.  The conflict between the three friends'
Catholic morality and their earthly desires is much more interesting
than the somewhat contrived external conflicts, and generally more
amusing besides.  CIRCLE OF FRIENDS takes some unfortunate and
unnecessary detours, but Minnie Driver and Chris O'Donnell take the
film's central story and turn it into a real winner.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 confessions:  7.</PRE>
