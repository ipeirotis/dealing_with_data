<P>     With FLUBBER, Disney is again guilty of self-cannibalization.  This 
film, a remake of THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR, is the production 
company's third recent re-working of one of their older films.  And, 
like both ONE-HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS and THAT DARN CAT, FLUBBER was 
developed with the lone goal of being successful at the box office.  One 
wonders if there's anyone at Disney capable of an original thought.  
After all, their biggest hit of the year, GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE, was a 
live-action version of an old TV cartoon.</P>
<P>     I find it amusing to note that, in the press notes for this film, 
Disney has referred to THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR as a "classic."  If 
this is an accurate description, then the word has undergone a radical 
devaluation.  The 1961 movie was, at best, a mildly-amusing diversion.  
Granted, it probably wasn't any worse than most of Disney's other live-
action offerings, but that hardly qualifies it as a "classic."  Of 
course, Disney has taken to using that term for just about everything 
they produce, deserving or not.</P>
<P>     I'm not going to spend much time comparing the original THE ABSENT-
MINDED PROFESSOR with director Les Mayfield's updated version.  Both are 
equally dopey, but, in large part because of the inclusion of Robin 
Williams (taking on the Fred McMurray part), FLUBBER has its share of 
genuinely funny moments, whereas the best THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR 
could manage was an occasional chuckle or two.  The special effects are 
obviously greatly improved, and the script has made allowances for the 
36-year time shift.  Watching the 1961 movie now is a good reminder of 
how much society has changed.  The involvement of John Hughes as co-
producer and co-writer guarantees a heavy portion of cartoon-like, 
physical comedy.  In fact, there are times when this movie feels like 
the latest installment in the over-milked HOME ALONE saga.</P>
<P>     Phillip Brainard (Robin Williams) is a science professor at the 
financially strapped Medfield College.  Although obviously a brilliant 
scientist, Phillip has a little personality defect:  he's forgetful.  
Actually, that's understating the situation -- he's not just 
absentminded, he's a senile fruitcake.  He has already forgotten to show 
up for his wedding twice, and, when he misses it for a third time, his 
girlfriend, Sara (Marcia Gay Harden), gives up on him.  It doesn't 
matter that Phillip has what he believes to be a valid excuse; she's not 
interested in hearing any more lame explanations.  </P>
<P>     The reason Phillip missed the wedding is because he made the 
scientific discovery of a lifetime -- something he calls "Flubber."  A 
jello-like green goo, Flubber has the ability to energize anything it 
comes into contact with.  Put some of the glop on a golf ball and it 
will bounce higher than the tree-tops.  People with Flubber-coated 
sneakers can jump so high that they're almost flying.  And a Flubber-
powered car can soar above the clouds.  Phillip sees his discovery as a 
means of saving the college and re-uniting him with Sara, who has begun 
dating the unscrupulous Wilson Croft (Christopher McDonald).  But, when 
a wealthy businessman (Raymond Barry) learns of Flubber, he becomes 
determined to possess it, even if that means getting his two idiot 
henchmen (Ted Levine and Clancy Brown) to break into the professor's 
home and steal it.  </P>
<P>     Most of the humor in FLUBBER is sophomoric, but that doesn't mean 
it isn't funny.  The film has its share of laugh-aloud scenes, many of 
which are fueled by Robin Williams' antics.  There's also a moment of 
explosive flatulence that had almost everyone in the audience in 
stitches.  On the other hand, the physical abuse suffered by the bad 
guys as they break into the professor's house isn't amusing.  This is 
standard John Hughes stuff, and he has used it too many times.  It 
worked in HOME ALONE, but has become progressively more tiresome since 
then.  What's so funny about a guy being repeatedly whacked on the head 
with a bowling ball?  </P>
<P>     One of the more innovative aspects of the film is a romantic 
subplot involving the professor's levitating robot 
assistant/companion/friend, Weebo (voiced by THE LITTLE MERMAID, Jodi 
Benson), who is infatuated with Phillip.  She dreams of taking a human 
form and actively works to sabotage his relationship with Sara.  In 
fact, there's more chemistry between Williams and this floating computer 
than there is between him and his female co-star, Marcia Gay Harden.  
Personally, I was rooting for Phillip to get together with Weebo in the 
end.</P>
<P>     Aside from the jokes that work and a typically high-energy 
performance by Robin Williams, FLUBBER doesn't have much to recommend 
it.  The creature, a special effects masterpiece, is cute to look at, 
but doesn't have much of a personality.  The bad guys are typically 
uninteresting, and the Phillip/Sara romance is trite.  The worst thing 
about the movie, however, is the low intelligence level of the script.  
The best family films have something for members of all different age 
groups; FLUBBER is aimed exclusively at the under-10 crowd.  If that 
describes your mental or physical age, you'll probably be hugely 
entertained.  More discriminating viewers may get a few laughs out of 
the film, but little else.  In plundering its own history, Disney has 
come up with yet another exercise in mediocrity.</P>
