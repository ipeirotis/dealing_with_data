<P>     In a way, it has been a sad thing watching Woody Allen grow as an
artist. I recall watching Allen as bumbling would-be thief Virgil
Starkwell in TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN as a youth every time it appeared on
local television; I remember the raucous laughter inspired by peeks at the
naughtier EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX and SLEEPER. This
was Woody before the more mature bittersweet comedy of ANNIE HALL,
MANHATTAN and HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, but also before the
look-Ma-I'm-Bergman phase of SEPTEMBER and ANOTHER WOMAN. In my heart I
longed for Allen to return to arrested adolescence in something besides
his romantic life, to a brand of comedy even solid films like MANHATTAN
MURDER MYSTERY and BULLETS OVER BROADWAY didn't provide. In my heart, I
longed for Allen to become Virgil Starkwell once again.</P>
<P>     I suppose I couldn't have asked for more convincing proof than SMALL
TIME CROOKS that Virgil Starkwell is, in fact, dead. Allen plays Ray
Winkler, an ex-con who's still got ideas about one big bank score. His
latest plan involves tunneling into a neighborhood bank from an adjoining
retail space, using his wife Frenchie's (Tracey Ullman) skill at baking
cookies as a front. Ray and his cohorts Denny (Michael Rapaport), Tommy
(Tony Darrow) and Benny (Jon Lovitz) struggle with digging their tunnel in
the right direction, but Frenchie's cookies prove to be a phenomenal
success. Instead of a bank score, the Winklers wind up with a business
score, landing them in the lap of luxury. And then the trouble begins ...</P>
<P>     The abrupt shift in plot from caper comedy to fish-out-of-water
comedy takes some adjusting, but it neither makes the film nor ruins it. 
Each segment of the film has its comic high points, from a broken water
main in the basement to an unhealthy obsession with finger bowls. There
are also distractions in each segment, including the faux-"Honeymooners" 
bickering between Ray and Frenchie and Hugh Grant's uncomfortable
performance as a fortune-hunting art dealer. As with most of Allen's
comedies of the last decade, there are just enough lively gags to remind
you why it's still worth looking forward to his films, and just enough
dead spots to remind you that he's just not the same.</P>
<P>     No shift in Allen's sensibility has been more damaging to his sense
of humor than the ever-increasing level of condescension in his films. 
Once upon a time, the jokes in Woody Allen's films were on Woody; he was
the neurotic bumbler whose every movement suggested he was not just out of
place in the world, but sometimes out of place in his own body. There's
one delightful moment in SMALL TIME CROOKS that nearly re-captures that
vibe -- Allen trying to slip away unobtrusively at a posh party -- but
more often the joke is on someone else. While Elaine May is amusing as
Frenchie's brain-dead cousin, she's also a walking punch line for Ray's
sense of superiority. When the film gradually becomes a lesson in being
careful what you wish for in case you actually get it, it's Ray's world of
simple pleasures that's held up as the ideal. Even when he's playing a
loser, he gets to win.</P>
<P>     I'd still rather watch any one of Allen's last dozen films (CELEBRITY
notably excepted) than the majority of what turns up on the local
multiplex screen. He's a smart guy who writes smart comedy, and he's
become an immensely gifted film-maker over his 30 year career as a
director. Unfortunately, you keep getting the sense that he knows it,
that he's grown so enamored of his ability to impress that he forgets what
an incredible gift he has simply to make us laugh. There's a sequence in
SMALL TIME CROOKS in which the film's characters are interviewed by "60
Minutes'" Steve Kroft for a newsmagazine story. There's some funny stuff
in that sequence, but it kept reminding me of the documentary style of
TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN. In SMALL TIME CROOKS, it's almost as though Allen
is trying to appease those aliens from STARDUST MEMORIES who cracked wise
about enjoying his "early, funny" films. Yet even when he's turning out a
passably entertaining comedy, it's clear he just doesn't have any Virgil
Starkwell left in him.</P>
