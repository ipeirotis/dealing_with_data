<PRE>                              KING OF THE HILL
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jesse Bradford, Jeroen Krabbe, Lisa Eichhorn,
           Spalding Gray, Karen Allen.
Screenplay/Director:  Steven Soderbergh.</P>
<P>     It's called the sophomore slump, and it's a pitfall common to all
contemporary art forms.  A writer has a lifetime to create the
breakthrough debut, and eighteen months to create a follow-up everyone
will expect to be equally good; as just the most recent cinematic
example, witness John Singleton's POETIC JUSTICE.  Writer/director
Steven Soderbergh turned heads with his first feature, 1989's SEX,
LIES AND VIDEOTAPE, then stumbled with the atmospheric but empty
KAFKA.  In such cases, the third try often will tell which was the
exception, and which the rule.  If this is true of Soderbergh, the
evidence that this is one auteur with staying power is KING OF THE
HILL, a beautiful and darkly poetic adaptation of A. E. Hotchner's
memoir of life during the Great Depression.</P>
<P>     Our tour guide through 1933 St. Louis is Aaron Kurlander (Jesse
Bradford), a bright and creative twelve-year-old.  His father (Jeroen
Krabbe) is an unemployed salesman, forcing the family to live in the
gloomy Empire Hotel.  When his younger brother (the adorable Cameron
Boyd) is sent away to live with relatives, Mom (Lisa Eichhorn) gets
sick and Dad gets a traveling salesman job, Aaron is left by himself.
The film follows his encounters and friendships with several fellow
residents of the Empire, including larcenous but good-hearted Lester
(Adrien Brody), well-heeled alcoholic Mr. Mungo (Spalding Gray) and
Ella (Amber Benson), a gawky, sad-eyed young girl with a big crush on
Aaron.  They all try to stay one step ahead of Ben (Joseph Chrest), the
Empire's reptilian bellhop who locks out delinquent guests at a
moment's notice.</P>
<P>     KING OF THE HILL's greatest triumph is one of tone.  As somber as
the subject matter could have been, Soderbergh opts neither for
grittiness nor Spielbergian sentimentality.  None of the Empire's
residents are treated as pathetic or heroic; they're simply decent
people trying to do their best with what they've been given.  There is
as much humor as their is sadness in KING OF THE HILL, perhaps more.
There are some truly charming moments:  Aaron's 8th-grade graduation
ceremony; Aaron and Lester saving the Kurlander's car from
repossession; Aaron improvising an exciting career for his father to a
wealth classmate between swigs of Coca-Cola.  All are lovingly
photographed by Elliot Davis and accented by a giddy Cliff Martinez
score reminiscent of Randy Newman.  To be certain, this isn't an
entirely pleasant film; there are some dark and bittersweet moments.
However, the balance is maintained so that it feels (at the risk of
sounding cliche) like life.</P>
<P>     The splendid ensemble cast only adds to the richness.  Heading the
list is Bradford, perfectly cast as the imaginative Aaron.  He manages
to capture both a savvy born of necessity and pubescent awkwardness
with understated style.  Krabbe is solid as the father unaware of how
his well-intentioned actions are hurting his son; Eichhorn is good but
misused as the fragile mother.  Of the hotel's denizens, I was
particularly taken with Amber Benson as Ella, who conveys a heartfelt
desperation for contact that generates some touching scenes with
Aaron.  Spalding Gray, as he does when he's cast in a film, basically
plays Spalding Gray.  Also worth noting is Karen Allen in an appealing
turn as Aaron's supportive teacher.</P>
<P>     I have no frame of reference for the historical accuracy of KING
OF THE HILL, but I do know that it *felt* real.  The tent cities,
railyard Hoovervilles and slum hotels coexist with mansions in casually
accepted fashion, free of some "issue" of class conflict.  There are
also intriguing character types, particularly the fascistic beat cop
who treats his street like a fiefdom.  In short, KING OF THE HILL feels
like a man's vivid memory of a difficult but enriching boyhood, told
with power and grace.  Soderbergh has a gift for visual narrative, and
it makes for an outstanding film.</P>
<PRE>     Third time is a charm Steven.  Keep it up.</PRE>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 tent cities:  9.</PRE>
