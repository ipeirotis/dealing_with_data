<P>SEPARATION, LA (director: Christian Vincent; cast: Isabelle Huppert
(Anne), Daniel Auteuil (Pierre), Louis Vincent (Loulou), Jerome
Deschamps (Victor), Karin Viard (Claire), Laurence
Lerel (Laurence), Nina Morato (Marie), France-1994)</P>
<P>Pierre (Daniel Auteuil), a book illustrator, and Anne (Isabelle
Huppert), a professional woman, are about to become separated despite an
apparently satisfactory marriage. They are an affluent couple, living in
a swell Parisian apartment, both of them nurturing all the love they
possibly can muster for their 15 month old boy Loulou (Louis Vincent,
the centerpiece of their lives), and are fortunate enough to have
supportive friends. The surprise comes when they are watching an Ingrid
Bergman film, where Ingrid states, "We have to change our way of
living," as he tries to hold her hand, which she rebuffs, saying she
just wants to watch the movie. Outside the theater she stuns him further
by saying she is in love with another man. And that's the gist of the
plot for this sophisticated and superbly acted romance story, that turns
the tables on the old notion that the man controls the destiny of the
household. Because of the expressiveness and raw emotions of the stars,
as they go through all kinds of mood swings and power plays until they
resolve this very ticklish and perplexing problem they face, we are
confronted with a situation whereas Pierre has done nothing ghastly to
ruin the marriage and the couple still profess a love for each other,
yet they are undergoing a separation.</P>
<P>The news of what is happening to Pierre takes some time to sink in, as
he doesn't know quite how to respond, at first, except by showing how
much his pride has been hurt. Anne's reaction is to avoid eye contact,
trying to console him gently, realizing how much she has hurt him. His
quiet manner, hurt expression, and look of bewilderment says it all.
While, strangely enough, they try to carry on with life as usual in
their apartment, as their ideal nanny, Laurence (Laurence), minds the
baby (she's a gem). After a few weeks of living like this, a rage starts
to build in him and his jealousy starts to take over. He confides in his
friend Victor (Deschamps) about how difficult it is for him, and Victor
is supportive of him, but there is little one can say that is eloquent
in such situations.</P>
<P>"In a couple, one suffers and the other one's bored, and vice versa."
This epigram, revealed near the beginning of  La Separation and repeated
near its end, explains in some way what has happened to their marriage.
It now becomes a question if they can weather this storm and the
bitterness that is so much a part of their love. A pivotal scene is when
the verbal fighting, accusations and hitting take place, that was really
unexpected from this urbane couple, except we see it building up and
festering inside the stricken Pierre. He feels like a wounded animal who
must strike back. When the 40-year-old Victor tells him that he going to
marry his long time girlfriend Claire (Viard), he can't even feel a joy
for his friend's decision, as he is totally wrapped up in his own
problems to be concerned with any one else's life.</P>
<P>The director wisely doesn't give us too much information about her lover
or the details of their love life. We are left to fend for ourselves and
see how uncommunicative they really are. At one point in the film, we
are told about a California woman who had no conversations with her
husband, so she miked their house and played back the tapes for divorce
court, where she collected a bundle from her husband. That more or less
sums up the direction the director was going with this one, by trying to
explain the imponderable reason for the snag in their marriage due to a
lack of communication.</P>
<P>This is an intelligent film, told from the point of view of the man,
though this film is not as powerful as Paul Cox's similar type of film
"My First Wife."  Its huge plus, however, is that it avoids the use of
cliches usually reserved for explaining why a couple is breaking up and
plays up the small petty things in a relationship that strain one's
nerves. This is exemplified in the scene where Anne is forced to fly a
kite, even when she tells her husband no. Her anger at him, brings home
the point of how silly most fights are.</P>
<P>When Pierre appears to be almost reconciled to the fact that he has lost
his wife and now 18 month old child, he wistfully responds by saying, "I
will now have to learn to live without you and Loulou."</P>
<P>Perhaps, Victor's comment to Pierre, "The last thing you find out is how
others see you," clarifies how couples after several years of a
seemingly contented marriage lose sight of each other's needs and a
destructive behavioral pattern sets in.</P>
<P>This marriage-go-round leaves us off in familiar territory. Most of us
know how it feels to be unsure of someone we love. And it stings. This
work is a testament to a confused couple who are sensible enough to face
things that are unpleasant to them in a forthright manner without
covering it up. It is only the real good directors, as evidently
Christian Vincent is, who can pull off such an imbroglio with everything
turning out to be in a daze for them; but, nevertheless, ending up
intact.</P>
