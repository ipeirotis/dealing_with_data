<P>     Consider KEYS TO TULSA a preemptive strike by first-time director
Leslie Greif and writer Harley Peyton (HEAVEN'S PRISONERS) for all the
bad reviews their film is going to get.  You see, the main character,
played by the ubiquitous Eric Stoltz, is a movie critic, and, to put it
mildly, he's an ineffectual moron.  In addition to not being an
admirable human being, he's not a very good critic -- he misses
deadlines, doesn't seem to know much about film, and never sees the
inside of a theater.  So, if you're predisposed not to like critics,
this is exactly the kind of scum you imagine we're all like.</P>
<P>     Actually, it's not just Stoltz's Richter Boudreau who's a sleaze. 
Everyone else in the film fits into that category, too, and they all
wear sunglasses, smoke cigarettes, and swill alcohol just to prove it
(there's more booze here than in any film this side of LEAVING LAS
VEGAS).  The movie doesn't seem to know what to do with all these
characters, so it throws them into a banal noir "thriller" that moves
with the speed of molasses and covers ground so well-trodden that the
footpath has widened into a highway.  Everything in KEYS TO TULSA seems
disconnected -- the people, the images, and even the various subplots. 
Of course, the script somehow manages to tie everything together into
one neat package at the end.  After all, there's nothing like a tidy, if
implausible and anticlimactic, conclusion. </P>
<P>     Richter, a reviewer for the Tulsa Journal, is clearly a ladies'
man.  After making the moves on a dim-but-curvaceous date (Cameron Diaz
in a bizarre cameo), he emerges from work one day to find a blond draped
across the hood of his car.  She's Vicky Stover (Deborah Kara Unger), a
former flame and the current wife of small-time dope dealer Ronnie
(James Spader).  She wants something from Richter, but it's not clear
exactly what that "something" is.  Ronnie wants something, too, but his
motives are less murky.  Richter owes him some money, and Ronnie intends
to extract payment by getting his help in a blackmail scheme. 
Meanwhile, Vicky's rich brother, Keith (Michael Rooker), enlists
Richter's aid when he believes that his sister is trying to steal his
fortune from him.  And Richter falls for an insecure stripper (Joanna
Going) who's involved in Ronnie's blackmail plan.  Throw in a dead body,
a lot of bare flesh, and a few incriminating snapshots, and, voila!, you
have a by-the-numbers noir feature.</P>
<P>     For a film with so many twists and turns, it's depressing how
unsurprising KEYS TO TULSA actually is.  The movie has the feel of
something that's desperate to get somewhere, but keeps spinning its
wheels.  I think we're supposed to identify with the down-on-his-luck
Richter, but it's hard to develop any sympathy for such an obvious loser
whose woes are all his own doing.  As for Richter's critical acumen--
he's the kind of guy who will sit through fifteen minutes of a movie
then write a review as if he'd seen the whole thing.</P>
<P>     Pity poor Deborah Kara Unger, who's once again stuck in a bad
marriage to James Spader.  While the relationship here is a little more
traditionally dysfunctional than that in CRASH, it's no less unpleasant. 
At least Unger is less bland in this movie; she plays her role with a
sultry abandon that, while totally over-the-top, has a prurient appeal. 
Meanwhile, Spader seems to be doing his best to impersonate Elvis.  With
his jet-black hair and sideburns, he's constantly primed to break out
singing "Hound Dog." </P>
<P>     Eric Stoltz, who's currently appearing in ANACONDA as well, seems
lost in his role, probably because he's trying to play it straight while
everyone around him is overacting to the hilt.  Take Joanna Going
(INVENTING THE ABBOTTS), for example.  While she has a couple of sweetly
effective scenes with Stoltz (such as the breakfast sequence where his
eyes are "mesmerized" by the flashes of skin her loose-fitting shirt
affords him), her big, emotional moments are painful to watch.  And
Michael Rooker never attempts to bring any subtlety to his brash,
constantly-drunk character.  The "colorful" supporting cast includes
Mary Tyler Moore as Richter's mother, James Coburn as the richest man in
Tulsa, and Peter Strauss as a lawyer.</P>
<P>     One thing KEYS TO TULSA succeeds at (besides developing a suitably
dark atmosphere, which is necessary for any film of this genre, no
matter how uninspired) is reminding us how truly effective films like
BLOOD SIMPLE and BOUND are.  It has always been true that it takes inept
motion pictures to highlight the strengths of their better antecedents,
and this is a case in point.  Ultimately, KEYS TO TULSA doesn't open any
new doors.</P>
