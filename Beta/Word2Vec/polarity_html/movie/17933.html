THE MISFITS  (director: John Huston; cast: Clark Gable (Gay Langland),
Marilyn Monroe (Roslyn Taber), Montgomery Clift (Perce Howland), Thelma
Ritter (Isabelle Steers), Eli Wallach (Guido), 1961)</P>
<P>Even though, Arthur Miller wrote this film for Marilyn, and she was most
affecting in this vulnerable role she had, this was possibly the best
role Gable ever had, excluding GWTW. He told friends he was working with
a bunch of loonies: At the time of the film's shooting, Clift was
abusing drugs and on the verge of a mental breakdown, and Arthur and
Marilyn were experiencing marital woes. Also, it is interesting to note
that this was both Clark's and Marilyn's last film. He died of a heart
attack just 2 days after shooting the film. Friends say that his rapid
loss of 40 pounds to be fit for the film and look good for Marilyn, may
have precipitated the attack, though this was denied by the surviving
Gable family. Clark insisted on doing all the rigorous stunts for the
film. Marilyn's supposed suicide, came shortly after the film opened.</P>
<P>The Misfits is about some modern day Reno denizens who have trouble
fitting into society, as they question life and their motives for doing
what they are doing. Gable is the cowboy who is a hard drinker and fast
with the women, but suffers from an inner melancholy. Monroe is the
recent divorcee, coming to Reno to get out of a bad marriage, who is
over-sensitive, and is confused about who she is. Eli is the second
banana to Clark, who pretends to feel things he doesn't feel, expecting
to make deals with everyone in order to carry out this charade of good
guy, but still fails to mask his envy for Gable, when the chips are
down. Clift is the honest cowboy hurt by the injustice of life, who
bemoans the fact that his father died in an accident and left the ranch
he loves more than anything else in this world to his mother, who has
remarried, and her new husband has the gall to offer Clift wages to work
the ranch he once owned. He is now wandering aimlessly on the rodeo
circuit, and is supposedly the young heroic version of Gable.</P>
<P>Marilyn acts as the mother superior to all these men who are attracted
to her both physically and spiritually. The film tries to debunk the
Western myth of rugged individualism, by showing how vulnerable they are
and how they try to mask their feelings by acting tough. After much
verbage, the climactic mustang round-up scene culminates in a heavily
laden bout of symbolism referring to the cowboy mentality and their need
to be free and independent, which Arthur Miller calls as pure poppycock,
a myth that was created and maintained by those who really don't know
what a cowboy life really is like. If you are looking for that kind of
Western here, you will not find it, even though you have a director and
stars of the film who have been very successful in previous Western
films, depicting that genre as it has come to be expected. There are no
heroes here, only lonely people trying to live with their illusions,
just like the audience is trying to see them as they were led to believe
cowboys should be like. All this might be confusing for those who never
dreamed they would see a Western with its stars having psychological
problems, and worried about earning a living. That sounds too much like
what ordinary people are going through.</P>
<P>This is a superior Western despite its non-action and debunking of one
of cinema's great myths, mainly because of its incisive
characterizations of these misfits, and because it was fun watching
these big stars work together, especially when realizing that there was
a lot of truth in the script that pertained to their real-life
situations.</P>
