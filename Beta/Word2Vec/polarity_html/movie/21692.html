<P>Being a huge fan of Kevin Smith, I was expecting a lot out of his newest
project 'Dogma'. It might just be Kevin's best work to date. It's very funny
with smart and foul-mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious
undertone to it and besides going against God and Jesus Christ, it actually
tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there isn't.
In 1994 a little $27,000 movie premiered at Sundance. This little film was
called 'Clerks' and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation.
You really can't meet a person on this green Earth who has not seen 'Clerks'.
It was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a
sequel is coming. In 1995 Kevin made another movie 'MallRats' that flopped
horribly, thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good
little flick. It was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997
'Chasing Amy' came out and was Kevin's biggest success to date. Now in 1999 we
get a great little movie by the name of 'Dogma'. </P>
<P>Wow! What a cast. Ok here is the plot in this movie: Linda Fiorentino plays a
regular woman who works at an abortion clinic. One day at her house Metatron
(the voice of God) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that
she must stop two fallen angels (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) from getting back
into Heaven by ways of a church. Ok now get this, she is told to find two
prophets: One who talks a lot and one who doesn't, however she gets Jay and
Silent Bob instead (who give us great performances). Now on her way to New
Jersey with Jay and Silent Bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th Apostle
falls out of the sky (Chris Rock) and helps guide her to find these angels.
Salma Hayek plays Serendipity who also helps her out along her way. Azrael
(Jason Lee) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they
can win. Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) has to now use the help of all these people
to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to Heaven leading
to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith. </P>
<P>What a movie, it is everything rolled into one: An offensive, offbeat, smart
and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end, and ends up
being a feel-good movie. Who would have known Kevin had such a soft side on him
that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself. Now for those of
you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart. Yes it
may target the Catholic community and bash them a lot, but it also seems to
rather than go against God and Heaven, it actually goes with God and Kevin
gives a message that there is a God. This review may sound confusing at first
but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie. </P>
<P>Kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great
characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know
the characters as we watch the movie. Of course the best (and funniest) of them
all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing
and that my friends are Jay and Silent Bob. Probably the best characters in
movies that I like. The star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos
by George Carlin, Jeanne Garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track
after a while. The script was written by Kevin Smith with many f'words in there
of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate
on what is important rather that what isn't and makes us laugh at the same time
as we think. </P>
<P>Chris Rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well,
with some classic lines. Linda Fiorentino is just perfect for her role and
makes us believe that she really is who she is. Of course Jason Mewes and Kevin
Smith do a great job as Jay and Silent Bob with some priceless lines from Jay
(as well as Silent Bob). Alan Rickman, Jason Lee, Salma Hayek round out the
cast with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in the starring roles. Being Oscar Winners
for the classic 'Good Will Hunting' they give great performances here again but
Matt Damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he
could. Ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as
the story. </P>
<P>The movie's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow
parts to go along with it. However the direction by Kevin and the script by
Kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members, 'Dogma'
stands as a new classic and I think I can safely compare it to 'Clerks'. While
being funny at times, in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important
message that some may not agree with but can't deny it. 'Dogma' will offend
people, especially deeply religious people, but for those of you who are open
minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you.
All Kevin Smith Fans MUST SEE!! </P>
