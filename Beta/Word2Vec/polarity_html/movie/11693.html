<PRE>"Mandingo" (USA, 1975)
a film review by James Kendrick</PRE>
<P>director: Richard Fleischer
screenwriter: Normal Wexler (based on the novel by Ken Ostott and the
play by Jack Krikland)
stars: James Mason (Warren Maxwell), Perry King (Hammond Maxwell), Susan
George (Blanche), Ken Norton (Mede), Brenda Sykes (Ellen), Ji-Tu Cumbuka
(Cicero), Roy Poole (Doc Redfield), Richard Ward (Agamemnon)
MPAA rating: R
review: *1/2 (out of ****)</P>
<P>"Mandingo" has traditionally been seen as one of two things: either a
much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the South, or in the words of
film critic Leonard Maltin, "a trashy potboiler" that "appeals only to
the S&M crowd." Actually, I think "Mandingo" is a strange combination of
the two, although it fails on both fronts. It's too trashy to be good
drama, but too dramatic to be good trash.</P>
<P>The story takes place on a dilapidated Louisiana plantation run by
crotchety old Warren Maxwell (James Mason) and his son, Hammond (Perry
King). One day in New Orleans, Hammond comes across a slave trader
selling a Mandingo named Mede (heavyweight boxer Ken Norton). Although
the movie never explains it, a Mandingo is simply the name for Africans
who come from the region of the upper Niger River valley. According to
the movie, Mandingos were the Rolls Royce of African slaves. Hammond
pays top price for Mede and has to fight off others in order to get him.
Hammond then spends his time training Mede to be a fighter in money
brawls with other slaves.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Hammond has married his cousin, Blanche (Susan George),
because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his
father to produce a grandchild. Hammond, however, is happier spending
nights with his "bed wench," the derogatory name given to female slaves
used by their masters for easy sex.</P>
<P>It is quickly apparent that Hammond, despite his overt racism, is more
in love with his bed wench, a sensitive slave girl named Ellen (Brenda
Sykes), than he is with Blanche. Hammond considers Blanche tainted goods
because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had
"pleasured" her before he did. Of course, it's fine that he's slept with
numerous slave girls, but the fact that his wife, a "white lady," had
been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for
her. So Blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while Hammond is
sleeping with Ellen.</P>
<P>Blanche gets back at Hammond by seducing the studly Mede and bearing his
child. Hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that Blanche has
given birth to a half-black child (although it's okay that Ellen was
pregnant by Hammond), so Warren kills the child by letting it bleed to
death after birth, and Hammond poisons Blanche. Hammond then finds Mede,
shoots him twice in the shoulder, and pushes him into a giant cauldron
of boiling water. Yes, you read right: the film ends with Hammond
getting his revenge by boiling Mede alive.</P>
<P>Judging only by the plot, "Mandingo" is pure sexploitation. The main
purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into
bed together as possible, with only the slightest commentary on what
that would mean in 19th century Southern society. When "Mandingo" was
released in 1975, it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation
on screen in such a graphic detail; this way the movie could revise
cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs.</P>
<P>Dramatically, "Mandingo" is weak and unfocused, and historically it's
mostly confused. If one were to judge history by this film, it would be
easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of American
slavery was based on sexuality, not economics. Not once in the film do
we see any of the slaves working, except for a few house servants. The
men spend most of the time sitting around, while the sole purpose of a
female slave seems to be free sex for the owner. There is historical
basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female
slaves, but "Mandingo's" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery
gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick (although
there's plenty of violence -- fights, vicious beatings, shootings, and
the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good
measure).</P>
<P>Some tried to write off "Mandingo" as a blaxploitation film, one of a
number of quickly-made, low-budget films appealing to black
sensibilities in the early seventies, but it's not that easy. "Mandingo"
was studio-financed by Paramount Pictures, and produced by Dino De
Laurentiis, the grandiose Italian producer behind such notorious
productions as "The Bible" (1966), the remake of "King Kong" (1976), and
the ill-fated "Dune" (1984).</P>
<P>The director was Richard Fleischer, a veteran who was best known for
several special effects-laden action movies including "20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea" (1954) and "Fantastic Voyage" (1966), as well as such
superior suspense films as "The Narrow Margin" (1952). The script, based
on the supermarket best-seller by Ken Ostott (and the subsequent play by
Jack Kirkland), was penned by Norman Wexler, who had been nominated for
an Oscar two years earlier for his work on "Serpico." James Mason, Perry
King, and Susan George were well-known and respected actors (Mason
already had three Oscar nominations under his belt), and Ken Norton
appeared to have a promising film career.</P>
<P>So why is "Mandingo" so bad? A number of reasons, including the fact
that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera
did a lousy job. Wexler's script is pure poor hokum bordering on the
offensive; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ("Yessuh, massuh"),
stereotyped Southern white trash talk ("Fer whut're you gittin' outta
bed?"), and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ("If you see me
hang, you gonna know you killed a black brother!"). Fleischer's
direction is clumsy, especially during the fight scenes, and all the
actors give weak performances, especially Susan George whose constant
shrieking finally becomes laughable.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, credit should be given where credit is due. Despite its
exploitative nature, "Mandingo" was one of the first Hollywood movies to
take an alternative look at slavery. Until then, there had been a kind
of underlying racism in all Hollywood films dealing with slavery. Even
classics such as "Gone With the Wind" (1939) can be seen as inherently
racist by its glossing over the subject matter. "Mandingo" reassessed
the South, and showed that it wasn't all beautiful plantations, green
fields, and pretty sunsets. But all this is constantly undermined by the
film's negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the
black perspective, but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera
tales of the white owners.</P>
<P>With a little more maturity and different handling, "Mandingo" might
have been an effective, worthwhile film. While it portrays many
sensitive aspects of slavery, it never deals with them. The issues the
movie brings up are worthwhile, but Wexler's script refuses to move them
beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing. There is a great
deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual
relationship between slave and owner, but "Mandingo" never does it.</P>
<P>Steven Spielberg touched on that same topic in "Schindler's List"
(1993), by looking at a Nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because
of his feelings for a Jewish maid. The difference between that film and
"Mandingo" is that Spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair,
unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma.
"Mandingo" is satisfied to simply show some skin, and because of that,
its "trashy potboiler" nature overshadows any potential social good it
might have accomplished.</P>
