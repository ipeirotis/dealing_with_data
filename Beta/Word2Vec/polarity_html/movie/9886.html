<PRE>                               KISS OR KILL
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<PRE>        "We watch the show of shadows kiss or kill,
         Flavored of celluloid, give love the lie"</PRE>
<PRE>                        - Dylan Thomas in the Opening Credits</PRE>
<P>     KISS OR KILL starts with a shocking immolation scene.  While the
mother burns, her small daughter looks on in horror.  We then cut to
the present where the now grown daughter,  Nikki, leads a life of crime
with her boyfriend, Al.</P>
<P>     This Australian criminals-on-the-run picture is directed by Bill
Bennett, whose last movie, TWO IF BY SEA, made my worst films list for
1996.  KISS OR KILL is infinitely better than his last picture, but
still not quite worth recommending.</P>
<P>     Two actors from the delightful but inconsequential LOVE AND OTHER
CATASTROPHES play the leads in KISS OR KILL.  Frances O'Connor is the
sleepwalking woman named Nikki, who may or may not slit throats as a
sideline, and Matt Day plays her explosive boyfriend, Al, who must be
the throat slicer if she isn't.</P>
<P>     It all starts with their usual MO.  Sexy Nikki, wearing a
minimalist red dress, hits on some married man alone in a bar.  After
luring him to her room for some hot sex, she drugs him, and she and Al
take the guy's money.  One night, they accidentally kill a guy with an
overdose, and, except for a Rolex, the only thing he has is a
videotape.  On the tape is a pedophiliac scene of a famous athlete
named Zipper Doyle (Barry Langrishe), now rich and retired.  And part
of the tape has a woman that looks like Nikki in bed with Zipper.</P>
<P>     If you're a fan of experimental editing techniques, you'll love
what editor Henry Dangar does in KISS OR KILL.  Using more jump cuts
that I've seen in while, scenes jump back and forth from wide angle to
close-up and forward and backward in time all while maintaining vocal
continuity.  When the story begins to flag, the editing does keep your
attention just as too much caffeine keeps you jittery.</P>
<P>     In contrast to the vicious killers on the loose, the local cops
are exceedingly polite.  Their every other phrase seems to be a hearty,
"thank you matey."  The film is set mainly in the Australian outback,
which the police describe succinctly as, "it's not the end of the
world, but you can see it from here."</P>
<P>     Although the two leads are good, their characters are rarely
compelling.  Both actors would be worth looking for in future movies.
KISS OR KILL is not a bad film, but it is too often more an exercise in
style than an interesting narrative.</P>
<P>     KISS OR KILL runs 1:33.  It is rated R for sex, nudity, profanity,
attempted rape, and gore.  The film would be acceptable for teenagers
only if they are older and very mature.</P>
