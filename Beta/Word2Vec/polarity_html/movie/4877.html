<P>     THE DESTINY OF MARTY FINE is a shoestring-budget independent 
feature with a fascinating premise that is totally wasted.  Talky, 
boring, and ultimately pointless, this film is distinguished only by 
several effective performances and a few nicely-written scenes.  In 
general, however, MARTY FINE is a disappointment.  It's one thing to be 
quirky; it's another to be incoherent.</P>
<P>     Marty (Alan Gelfant) is an ex-boxer with a dream of opening a 
boxing training camp in Utah.  That's all it is, however -- a dream.  
Marty doesn't even have pocket change, not to mention the dose of cash 
needed for such an ambitious project.  So he approaches a big-time 
boxing promoter (Michael Ironside) with his idea.  Much to Marty's 
surprise, the promoter expresses some interest.  Unfortunately, before a 
deal can be struck, a car speeds by, a few shots are fired, and Marty is 
left standing over a dead body.  From that point on, his luck goes from 
bad to worse.  His girlfriend (Catherine Keener) kicks him out, he's 
locked out of his gym locker, a friend (Glenn Plummer) needs back $200 
Marty borrowed from him, and someone else wants him to perform a hit as 
a demonstration of friendship.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, MARTY FINE isn't concerned about telling a story.  The 
narrative gets lost in a seemingly-endless sequence of uninteresting 
conversations.  There's nothing inherently wrong with ninety minutes of 
dialogue, as long as what's being said is worth hearing.  That's not the 
case here.  The only ones who appreciate what these people have to say 
are the characters themselves.  Except for the exchanges between Marty 
and his girlfriend, it's difficult to find high points.  </P>
<P>     The cinematography, done in 16 mm black-and-white, is suitably 
atmospheric, but the noir-ish quality of the production is undermined by 
its confusing and unfocused storyline.  It's never clear where MARTY 
FINE is going, or whether it ever gets there.  Transitions are virtually 
nonexistent, and the ending is abrupt.  The actors all do good jobs 
(even Norman Fell!), but their skills are wasted on such sub-par 
material.  I have little doubt that MARTY FINE is destined for 
obscurity.</P>
