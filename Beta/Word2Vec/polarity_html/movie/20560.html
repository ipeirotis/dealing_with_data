<P>BROTHER (BRAT) (director/writer: Alexi Balabanov; cinematographer:
Sergei Astakhov; cast: Sergei Bodrov (Danila), Viktor Soukhoroukov
(Viktor), Svetlana Pismmitchenko (girlfriend), Maria Joukova (Kat),
1997-Rus.)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Home from the Chechen War, where he was a h.q. clerk, Danila (Sergei
Bodrov) is now aimless and unemployed. His mother tells him to leave
this small village and go to St. Petersburg, formerly Leningrad and see
his older brother Viktor (Soukhoroukov); he is the only hope for you. He
will help you get work.</P>
<P>In St. Petersburg, he finds that Viktor works for the Russian mob and is
in trouble with a Chechen mobster who has control of the black market
operations in town. Viktor gets Danila to do some of the dirty gun work
he can't do himself against his stronger opposition. This is all played
out against the background of a Russia falling apart as a world power;
its cultural roots are in decay as its youth is turning to drugs and a
decadent Western style of rock music, and its cities are becoming safe
havens for gangsters to act with impunity, causing a breakdown in law
and order.</P>
<P>Danila is fiercely proud to be Russian, anti-intellectual, and a newly
converted fan of the Russian rock group Nautilus, who have a hit cd
Wings he has a hard time finding in any store. It was easier for him to
be pulling off his first job against the Chechen mobster than buying a
Nautilus cd. On that assignment, he ends up killing one of the Chechen's
henchman; and in his escape, he is slightly wounded, as he hops onto a
tram and gets help from the driver, Svetlana (Svetlana). Her husband is
in jail, which gives him the opportunity to have sex with her. In his
forceful and blunt way, hiding his violent tendencies with the warmest
smile in St. Petersburg, he professes to have a real romantic interest
in her, sincerely sympathizing with her that men are often beating her
up. She seems to so passively accept her beatings as part of her life,
which I guess is symbolic of how Russia treats its women.</P>
<P>Everything that we learn about the new Russian attitudes comes from
seeing it through Danila's naive eyes. He is someone searching for a
morality that seems to have evaporated from the old Russian cities. When
he befriends a German peddler, by protecting him from mobsters who are
trying to shake him down, he does so because he feels it is the right
thing to do. He expresses gratitude that the peddler is not a Jew but a
German, because he doesn't like Jews but he doesn't have anything
against Germans. The German turns out to be a man who doesn't know
anymore what is happening to society, but he likes to live by this
saying, "What is good for the Russian, is death for the German." At a
later point in the story, he tells the country boy, "that the cities are
dark forces, the strong come here, but they get weak. The city takes
over their strength." This scene for one thing tells how xenophobic the
Russians have always been and still are.</P>
<P>Danila's entry into the drug and rock scene, comes about when he is
attracted to a young druggie hipster, the pert blond, Kat (Joukova), who
gets him to spend money on drugs so that they can party together.
Meanwhile he continues working for his weak-kneed brother, by helping
him knock off a few of the Chechen mobsters. The brother is startled at
how good Danila is with a gun, something he probably learned during the
war, even though Danila is evasive about what he did during his army
tenure.</P>
<P>Danila doesn't complain that he is doing all the dirty work, he now has
plenty of money for the girls; and, enough money to buy himself clothes,
and to get the cd's he loves listening to and talking about. His
mindlessness and quiet charm, and the heroic qualities he often
displays, are both chilling and pitiful to observe. All his
accomplishments seem to come through the force of a gun.</P>
<P>If anything, this slickly done gangster thriller, should be taken as a
political warning by the West that Russia is a wounded animal and still
dangerous, and a wounded animal is frightened and will often do anything
to lash out at those it perceives as hurting it. There were many
diverting scenes that make that point crystal clear. In a drugged and
alcoholic stupor, at a party with Kat, he lashes out verbally at a
musician he thinks is American. When told that he is French, he replies,
"same insults go for him."</P>
<P>In another scene that shows his hatred for things that are American, he
is in MacDonalds and refuses to eat the American food; but Kat, who is
heavily into the Western scene, is seen gleefully gulping down a hot
apple pie.</P>
<P>What should make Danila's character frightening to the West, is that his
prejudices and violent acts are readily accepted by the movie-going
Russian public as the proper way to act.</P>
<P>When Viktor betrays Danila to the Chechan mobsters, who invade Viktor's
apartment to set a trap for the brother, he outfoxes them and succeeds
in killing off his brother's enemies, sparing the life of his cowardly
brother. He then reverses the mocking remarks his mother told him when
he first came home from the army: as he now mockingly tells the
sniveling Viktor to hitch-hike back to mamma and take care of her with
the money he just gave him; she is an old lady and needs you. It seems
there is a special place in his heart for the Russian, even if he is a
betrayer, after all, he is a Russian (brother).</P>
<P>Danila backtracks to his girlfriends. But they don't love him or even
want to know him. So he leaves one a musical tape and the other a little
money he collected from his criminal efforts and he grabs a ride from a
truck driver who is heading to Moscow. That should be another stop where
his resume as a gangster will come in handy for the future.</P>
<PRE>He is just as dangerous and aimless and charming as when he left the
army.</PRE>
<P>Sergei Bodrov is devastating as the symbol of the "old" Russian coming
back as the "new" Russian. His performance gives the film a
reverberating force, depicting the chaos currently going on in a
deteriorating country, and how difficult it would be to reach someone
like him, when he can be so deceptive by just smiling and so distant by
tuning out what he doesn't want to hear. It is in his soul that rests
the centuries of Russia's life of misery and war, whose struggle is
never over but always seems to be just beginning. He has infused the
film with a raw power, that touches the nerves of the things that
Westerners understand the least about the Russians. All this makes for a
fascinating film, one that is popular in Russia, and is quite different
from the usual Russian films exported to America. It is one of the most
insightful films I have seen about modern Russia and how organized crime
has taken a foothold in the country. It is a film that has its finger on
the problems the severe economic decay in Russia and the rise of
criminals to fill the void of a lost morality, has caused. Russia is now
a country where even a brother might be taken for a stranger, except for
our gangster hero, who is trying to make some sense of what he sees
going on since the collapse of Communism, whose simple forceful ways to
back up the wrongs he sees seem very attractive to a desperate and
cynical people who yearn for a hero to save them from all the
corruption. This film has the look and tone of those old American B
movies, but with a little more depth in its political aims and much more
pessimism for its country'sfuture.</P>
