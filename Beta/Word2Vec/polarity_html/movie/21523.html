<PRE>THE BONE COLLECTOR
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Less than 5 minutes into THE BONE COLLECTOR, the movie already has you
laughing at the stupidity of one of the two leads. Not a good omen.</P>
<P>Ex-fashion model turned street cop, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) goes
alone -- no partner and no backup -- into a remote and dangerous area to
investigate what will prove to be a heinous crime scene. (Jolie is
convincing as an ex-fashion model but badly miscast as a cop.)  After
locating a mutilated corpse, Donaghy notices a small stack of evidence
on the nearby train tracks. When she sees an Amtrak locomotive barreling
down the tracks, she doesn't just scoop up the evidence. Oh no, that
would be too easy and not dramatic enough. Instead, she stands on the
tracks and hopes she can stop a speeding train that is coming right at
her. Trains like these take a long distance to come to a halt, but this
one stops just a few feet short of killing her and messing up her
evidence.</P>
<P>Denzel Washington plays a quadriplegic homicide detective named Lincoln
Rhyme, whose skills rival those of the great Sherlock Holmes. As we
first meet Rhyme, he's arranging for a doctor to kill him since he's
worried that he will become a vegetable. This arrangement is put on hold
when he's asked to help in solving the aforementioned case. The "perp"
(as in the perpetrator of the murder) turns out to be a serial killer
who loves leaving very obscure clues about his next victim.</P>
<P>Sound like David Fincher's SEVEN? With its gruesome crimes, THE BONE
COLLECTOR does possess many similarities -- the quality of the writing
and direction, however, not being part of them. THE BONE COLLECTOR,
directed by Phillip Noyce (THE SAINT) and scripted by Jeremy Iacone, is
a preposterous and predictable movie that insults the viewers'
intelligence every chance it gets. Only viewers who fall asleep will not
be able to guess who the last attempted victim will be.</P>
<P>In one of my favorites of the film's numerous improbabilities, Officer
Donaghy's boyfriend breaks up with her because of his therapist's
advice. With Angelina Jolie's looks, how many men would take that
advice? Most would quickly get rid of the therapist instead.</P>
<P>The director's staging is infuriating with his blend of overly clever
and clichéd plot devices. In order to illustrate how much Rhyme misses
the loss of his freedom, a peregrine falcon is shown in frequent
close-ups on the ledge of his apartment. The bird gets to flap his wings
and fly away. Rhyme doesn't have that same mobility, as we are
constantly reminded.</P>
<P>Rhyme decides that only Donaghy, a relative rookie, will do to be his
hands and eyes for the big investigation. He doesn't want some seasoned
veteran. Does this make any sense at all? Of course not.</P>
<P>Another ludicrous part of the story has a stuffed-shirt police boss,
Capt. Cheney (Michael Rooker), shut down Rhyme's entire investigation
just so that Capt. Cheney can save all the glory for himself.</P>
<P>Scene after scene is filled with abundant good luck. When Rhyme decides
that they need to locate a very old book, of which they don't even know
the title, the first bookstore that Donaghy goes to has it. Even better
than that, when she reaches up and accidentally pulls down a large batch
of books from the top shelf, on the top of the stack turns out to be
exactly the one she needs. Talking about a needle in the haystack!</P>
<P>The shamelessly manipulative story even falls back on the old child
endangerment episode for some cheap thrills. A sweet and innocent little
girl and her elderly grandfather are taken off so the killer can arrange
for them to die a miserable death.</P>
<P>So who is the killer? Don't waste your time guessing. The movie is one
of those infuriating ones in which the solution to the mystery comes
completely out of left field.</P>
<P>Denzel Washington, who has demonstrated his considerable talents in many
wonderful films (including MALCOLM X and HE GOT GAME), has sometimes
even been able to save some mediocre ones. FALLEN, for example, would
have been just a run-of-the-mill supernatural thriller without
Washington's efforts in it. No matter how hard he tries, however, even
Washington isn't able to save THE BONE COLLECTOR from its hackneyed
script and its ridiculous direction.</P>
<P>THE BONE COLLECTOR runs a long 1:58. It is rated R for strong violent
content, including grisly images, and for language. The film would be
acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature.</P>
