<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Writer/director John Sayles weaves an intriguing story that is both a
mystery and a study about the relationship between the generations and
the races. It is set in a small Texas border town of Frontera, where 19
out of every 20 citizens is Mexican. When two soldiers (Mendillo & Lang)
are looking at desert plant life in an abandoned Army rifle range, they
discover a human skull, a Masonic ring, and a corroded sheriff's badge.
It turns out that this is the body of the venal Sheriff Charlie Wade
(Kristofferson), who was reported missing 40 years ago. He was a corrupt
sheriff who had his hand in every crooked scheme that went on in town
and loved to dish out his idea of the law with excessive force. He was
unaffectionately known as a 'bribes 'n' bullets' lawman. When the
current sheriff, Sam Deeds (Cooper), learns of the discovery, he thinks
that his father Buddy Deeds, the one who became a revered sheriff
afterwards, killed him to become sheriff.</P>
<P>Sam gets Hollis Pogue (James), the current mayor, who was Wade's deputy
back in 1957, to tell him again about the confrontation his father had
with Wade the night he disappeared and how his dad refused to obey
Wade's orders and Wade threatened to kill him, but Buddy never backed
down. The legend got started that, after the incident, Buddy made Wade
run away from town, because he was afraid his corruption would come to
light through Buddy.</P>
<P>Sam had gotten married and then divorced to a manic-depressive rich
woman (Frances McDormand), and returned to town two years ago when his
friends asked him to run for sheriff. He idolized his father for the
first fifteen years of his life, but in the next fifteen years of his
life he felt resentment toward him. He learned that his father also made
deals with criminals, had a mistress, and received bribes. But people
respected him for being fair to them and not being cruel in his
enforcement of the law, even his bigotry was not as hateful as in the
past, he only made sure that the races should stick to their own kind,
and did not have a grudge against the non-whites. He was the kind of man
legends were made of, as all the people liked him.</P>
<P>Sam's most traumatic moment came when he was a high school student and
was dating a Mexican girl Pilar Cruz (Elizabeth Peña), whom he was
deeply in love with. His father and his deputy spotted the two of them
in a drive-in movie and separated them for good. Sam never forgave his
father for doing that, even though by the film's end we learn why he did
it.</P>
<P>Pilar was transferred to the Catholic high school and married someone
who died recently. She currently is a responsible high school history
teacher, teaching the course in a way the anglican community feels is
distorting their history, as she points out that their white heroes,
such as, Davy Crockett, were also slave traders. She has a daughter who
is an honor roll student, but she has trouble from her teenage son, who
has rebelled against her and is sometimes in minor trouble with the law.</P>
<P>Pilar's relationship with her mother (Miriam Colon) is still strained
because of their different viewpoints. Her mother owns a very successful
restaurant, where she hires Mexicans with green cards and treats them
harshly, shaking her head that they can't assimilate and speak English,
forgetting how she came to this country as a wetback herself and has now
risen to be the town's councilwoman. When her husband was killed, she
never took another man becoming a bitter woman, putting all her effort
into the restaurant. Upon seeing wetbacks crossing the lawn of her
luxurious ranch home, she calls the border patrol.</P>
<P>The black population comes mostly from Fort McKenzie, an Army post that
is on the verge of being closed. The black people's social life revolves
around either the church or Otis Payne's bar, or as Otis so aptly says,
most go to both, since there is no demarcation between good and evil.
Sam will learn in his informal investigation, one in which his Texas
Ranger friend is officially running but not trying too hard to discover
anything, that Otis was with Wade the night he disappeared. The past
also catches up with Otis, as the son he abandoned has become the new
colonel (Morton) in the fort. The colonel is a by-the-book military man,
with a rigid sense of duty. The confrontations he has with his father
are genuinely moving. His character grows as the story allows him to
show he is a dynamic person, capable of tender emotions and expressing
humane responses, as well as someone who is able to make his own breaks
in life and rise from his impoverished position in life all by himself.</P>
<P>This is a slow moving, superbly acted, thoughtful, provocative look at
America's past and where it is now, as seen through the past lives of
the main characters depicted in the three ethnic communities. The
laconic tone of the film and the strong intellect in the script bring so
many other things to the table, that the mystery, even though it is
followed through and wrapped up, is not quite as important as all the
other issues it brings up. The subtle message being that the past must
be remembered but it is more important that the future must not be
blurred by what already happened and can't be changed. That racial
conditions have improved in this country, but not to the point where
each group can accept the other, as each feels most comfortable only
with their own kind. The blacks have their own bar, as do the whites,
while the Mexicans have their own restaurant and cultural needs, which
include speaking Spanish. The whites feel like they are being pushed out
of their own country, the blacks feel that there should be more of them
in town, while the Mexicans feel they should be running things since
they are in the majority. But what is important for Sayles, is that
things must be allowed to change for the better in a loving way, and
each group must somehow learn to accept the other. The story challenges
race relations, borders, parent and child relations, the teaching of
history, government responsibility to its citizens, political
corruption, military duty, patriotism, and basically what it is to be an
American.</P>
<P>This ambitious project is an engrossing and an original work. There are
no predictable and formulaic messages, this is one of the great films of
the 1990s, one that is done with wit and tact. Everything about it rings
with truth, even if it has to break down a few legends to get its point
across --  proving that often enough, legends are not all they are
cracked up to be.</P>
