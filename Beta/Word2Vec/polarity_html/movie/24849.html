<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This creepy serial killer tale had all the more fright in it than the
more highly touted "Felicia's Journey, "and was a superior telling of a
homicidal maniac on the prowl story than the more flamboyant venture
"American Psycho" was. The Minus Man stars Vann Siegert (Owen Wilson),
as an affable, clean-cut, blond drifter, with a bland personality, and
someone who offers no reasons for what he does, except some vague
philosophical explanations, as he talks into his miniscule tape recorder
revealing his private thoughts: "I look for the meaning of things and
act upon it at the spur of the moment. I take the natural momentum of a
person and draw it towards me. You don't always choose what you do,
sometimes what you do chooses you."</P>
<P>Hampton Fancher, the Blade Runner screenwriter and the first-time
director of "The Minus Man," creates a film that sets a dark mood of
everyday normal life contrasted by the cheery personality of Vann, who
looks like the average "Joe," easily fitting into his surroundings. He
drives his blue pickup truck from somewhere in the Pacific Coast, hiding
the poisons underneath his truck he discovered there, while spending so
much time alone in the woods. He is such a well-mannered and congenial
young man, whose appeal is supposed to make us irritated that we can
like someone like him. He even tells us in his narration, how good he
feels about himself, as he crows to himself that he does his killings
with the minimum of violence.</P>
<P>The film opens when Vann enters a nearly empty roadside bar, pays an
attractive alcoholic and junkie's (rock star Sheryl Crow) bar tab, gives
her a lift, watches her get high on smack, and offers her a poisoned
drink of Amaretto from his flask for a quick and painless death. A crime
with no sex or any other motive. The emptiness of his action, and the
film's emphasis on his charms, while keeping his past mysterious, adds
chills to his moody persona.</P>
<P>Vann spends the night asleep in his truck by the beach, but is awakened
and questioned by a state trooper about why he is in an off-limits area.
But, because he is so polite, he does not arouse the trooper's
suspicions and therefore no search of the vehicle takes place. He shows
up the next morning in a sleepy West Coast suburban town and rents a
room in a cottage from an unhappy middle-aged couple whose daughter they
tell him is away in college, but later it becomes evident that she must
be missing, or ran away, or is dead (it is never explained which).</P>
<P>Jane (Mercedes Ruehl) is at first suspicious of the renter, but Doug
(Brian Cox) takes to him right away and gets him a temp job for
Christmas in the local post office. Doug, lonely for companionship -- as
the couple is quietly depressed -- takes Vann to the local high school
football game, where he meets the star player (Mabius) afterwards in a
restaurant. Next week, before a big November game, he gives the football
player with the promising future in the F.B.I. but doubts about the
present, a lift in his truck and allows him to have a few swigs from his
poisoned Amaretto flask. He even joins the search party looking for him
when he is reported missing, looking hard for him, even though he knows
that he has already buried him somewhere out of their sight.</P>
<P>Vann often has vivid fantasies that he is being vigorously interrogated
by a pair of rough detectives (Dwight Yoakam and Dennis Haysbert) who
have been tracking him down and suspect him of being the serial killer,
but can't come up with the proof (like everything about Vann, it is
never made clear whether this a projection, had actually happened or
will happen in the future).</P>
<P>While at the the post office, he impresses his supervisor (Rey) that he
is diligent, so he is given even more responsibilities, even subbing for
a letter carrier who is ill. The routine work seems to agree with him,
as he mentions that this is the best job he ever had. At the workplace,
his co-worker, Ferrin (Janeane Garofalo), finds him appealing and tries
to make herself available to him. This is a different kind of part for
the usually gruff Garofalo. Here she plays a sweet, vulnerable girl, who
wants a serious relationship, but has trouble getting the shy Vann in an
amorous mood, and when she does succeed, he is so awkward in his
physical advances to her, that she is scared off by him.</P>
<P>What carries the day for this film about the banality of evil, which
presents its story as a mind game Owen Wilson is playing, is the strong
performances by him and Brian Cox, as they both are good at conveying
men who are psychologically damaged goods. While Janeane Garofalo and
Mercedes Ruehl are able supporting characters, completely believable as
women who need a man in their life to feel fulfilled. The film gets
over, despite its weakness of allowing  the serial killer to be someone
whom we can never understand or come to terms with.</P>
<P>These weird killings do happen in present society, and when we read
about them in the newspapers, we even know less about 'why' than we do
here. In the characterization Wilson gave to this psychopath, you could
see how his normalcy wasn't normal, and maybe that's about all we know
about most serial killers. But, we can't let society off the hook as
generously as we do in the newspapers, and what makes this film
particularly engaging, at least more engaging than most of the serial
killer films I have seen recently, is that in this film the sickness in
society also becomes part of understanding why these weird things
happen. What is unsaid becomes, at least, pointed out as to where we
should start looking for answers, if we can only stop looking at the
conventional places where we usually look and start looking at ourselves
as a society and what we have created. I just wish this film had more
body in it, more of a feeling for what it was up to, something more
revealing.</P>
