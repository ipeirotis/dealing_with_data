<P>     To viewers of Comedy Central and PBS, Rowan Atkinson is a familiar 
face.  The British comedian, who is recognized around the world as one 
of today's funniest people, has starred in three popular "Brit-coms":  
NOT THE NINE O'CLOCK NEWS, BLACK ADDER, and MR. BEAN.  It is the latter 
program, which became one of the highest-rated shows in Britain, that 
earned Atkinson international fame.  Nevertheless, because the series is 
aimed at a niche market in the United States, Atkinson is still best 
known in this country for his roles in FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (as 
the blundering priest who utters the benediction, "In the name of the 
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spigot") and THE TALL GUY (as the 
egotistical star of the stage show).  With BEAN, Gramercy Pictures (and 
its parent company, Polygram) hopes to change that.</P>
<P>     While BEAN branches out from the format developed for the 
television series, it remains faithful to the concepts and constructs 
that led to its success.  Part of the reason for this is the involvement 
of screenwriters Richard Curtis and Robin Driscoll, who collaborated on 
most of the TV episodes.  Director Mel Smith, who previously helmed THE 
TALL GUY, has known Atkinson and Curtis since 1979 when all three worked 
together on NOT THE NINE O'CLOCK NEWS.  Meanwhile, Atkinson plays Mr. 
Bean exactly as he did on television:  a mean-spirited, self-serving, 
infantile caricature with an endless capacity for causing disasters.  
Viewers of vintage films will recognize a little of Charlie Chaplin in 
Atkinson's portrayal.  Younger fans will inevitably compare him to '90s 
pop icon Jim Carrey.  Both Carrey and Atkinson share a fondness for 
screwball, physical comedy and possess the ability to contort their 
features into seemingly-impossible expressions, although Atkinson's 
apparently-reserved demeanor makes him seem funnier than Carrey.  </P>
<P>     There are three main changes from the television series.  The first 
is a shift in location from England to Los Angeles.  The second is 
giving the normally-silent title character a few more lines than usual.  
By his standards, Bean is positively loquacious here, making a speech, 
and, at one point, even being told to "be quiet."  The third, which is a 
mistake, is attempting to develop the supporting characters beyond their 
natural roles as victims of Mr. Bean's blundering.  It doesn't work.  
Those individuals, like the plot itself, are throwaways.  </P>
<P>     BEAN begins by giving Mr. Bean a job -- he holds an unspecified 
position at the London National Art Gallery.  ("I sit in a corner and 
look at paintings" is how he describes it.)  In order to get rid of him, 
the board of directors decides to send him on a mission to America.  The 
California-based Grierson Gallery has just purchased the painting 
"Whistler's Mother" and is looking for a noted art historian to be 
present at the grand unveiling.  When they write requesting an expert 
from the London Art Gallery, however, they don't expect to be visited by 
the seven plagues -- all in the form of one man.  And, while Bean wreaks 
havoc all over Los Angeles, no one is more affected than David Langley 
(Peter MacNicol), the Grierson Gallery's curator.  In only a few days, 
his wife, Alison (Pamela Reed), and two children have moved out, his 
house is a disaster area, and his job is on the line.  And that's before 
Mr. Bean gets his hands on "Whistler's Mother."</P>
<P>     Although BEAN contains a fair share of bathroom humor, flatulence 
jokes, and assorted gags featuring bodily fluids, not everything is 
lowbrow, and this is an aspect that differentiates it from the likes of 
ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE.  The script contains instances of dry wit, 
such as detailing the merchandising plans of the Grierson Gallery for 
"Whistler's Mother" (it's reminiscent of the MY DINNER WITH ANDRE action 
figures from WAITING FOR GUFFMAN), and some biting dialogue (Bean's 
description of the painting's subject:  "a hideous old bat who looks 
like she's got a cactus lodged up her backside").  </P>
<P>     This storyline is basically just a setup for a series of variably 
funny comedy skits.  The episodic nature of the narrative leads to some 
hilarious sequences and a few dull patches.  Overall, things seem a 
little stretched out, making it clear that a 30-minute TV slot is a 
better length for Mr. Bean than a 90-minute feature film.  By the end of 
BEAN, the talented Atkinson begins to wear out his welcome, and the rest 
of the cast -- a predominantly lifeless group of actors -- offers little 
support.  Despite several side-splitting scenes (Bean's bathroom antics, 
Bean in an amusement park, Bean stuffing a turkey, Bean examining 
"Whistler's Mother"), the comedy in the film is too uneven to justify 
the length.  Thanks to Atkinson, BEAN is a pleasant diversion, but it's 
far from the comic masterpiece sought after by BEAN aficionados and 
novices alike.</P>
