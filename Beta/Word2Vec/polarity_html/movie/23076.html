<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"Laura" is an elegant but campy B&W "who-dun-what," noted for its witty
dialogue and exquisite romantic atmosphere among the upper-class society
types being confronted by a detective from the proletarian-class. It is
the first major film Preminger directed and arguably his best, in a film
that he was originally fired from by 20th Century Fox's studio head,
Darryl Zanuck, only to be rehired by him after his replacement Rouben
Mamoulian didn't pan out. This didn't stop the constant bickering
between Otto and Darryl, as the studio head wanted John Hodiak for the
Dana Andrews part, and he did not want newcomer Clifton Webb in the
villain role, nor did he want first-time cinematographer Joseph La
Shelle to do the photography for the film. It is a good thing Otto won
his argument, because his choices all did great jobs, and Webb, LaShell,
and Preminger all received Oscar nominations, with only the
cinematographer winning. It should also be noted that Jay Dratler,
Samuel Hoffenstein, and Betty Reinhardt, were nominated for best
screenplay.</P>
<P>The French reviewers in the 1940s were the first to call this kind of
dark thriller, a noir film. It is one of six or so films they named,
such as "The Maltese Falcon." Though "Laura"  was different in nature-it
was not based on a hard-boiled novel-it still became a prototype for
this emerging genre. "Laura" has a majestic bent to it, exhibited from
the very first scene, where a self-centered, debonair columnist/radio
personality, with an acerbic wit, Waldo Lydecker (Webb), provides the
voiceover, as he sits in his bathtub writing Laura's biography, as the
audience tours his swank Manhattan penthouse. He also immediately
impresses the viewer with his unsavory characteristics and sexual
obsession with a woman who was just found murdered. He is being
questioned about his relationship with Laura by the detective, Mark
McPherson (Dana), who is his complete opposite. He is a ruggedly
handsome, muscular type, who speaks in the common-man's vulgar tongue as
compared with the snobbish effete lingo of Waldo.</P>
<P>The question of love is posed, as the efficient McPherson wants to know
about the relationship between Waldo and the beautiful Laura, believing
he can nail the murderer by knowing something about the woman killed.
Waldo is portrayed as being obsessed with her, but their relationship
was not a sexual one, but one of friendship, where she got her first
break through him and she quickly moved up in the advertising world into
a position of prominence through her own ability, where she could now
afford a luxury townhouse apartment and a maid. When the question of
love gets kicked back to the detective by Waldo, as he asks if he's ever
been in love, he snappily retorts, "A doll in Washington Heights got a
fox fur out of me once."</P>
<P>In Laura's place, Mark sees the portrait of her, and finds her to be
captivating, but when asked by Waldo what he thinks, he can only say,
"not bad." Waldo volunteers information about how obsessed he is with
her and jealous of her other boyfriends in the 5 years he knew her. He
tells of Laura falling for the artist who painted her portrait, and how
he broke up that relationship by doing a hatchet job on the mediocre
artist in his newspaper column, thereby getting Laura to come to her
senses and see what a second-rate fellow he was. He also talks about her
current boyfriend, Shelby Carpenter (Price), whom he despises as being
someone who is a weakling, a scoundrel and a scam artist. Laura's older
aunt, Anne Treadwell (Judith), is in love with Shelby, and doesn't care
if his character is rotten, even supporting him with money, as the broke
society person from Kentucky, whose credentials are dubious, has no
shame about his different affairs coinciding.</P>
<P>These three are suspected by the detective, who in his relentless quest
to get the murderer, digs into Laura's life. He reads the love letters
Waldo wrote her, her diary, and is curious about the gifts Waldo gave
her, such as the big clock in her parlor. He wonders about Shelby's
alibi and the lies he gets caught telling, and he wonders about the key
to Laura's apartment that Shelby said he didn't have but which turns out
he did have. He wonders about who is telling the truth about Laura's
engagement, when Waldo said she went to her country home for the weekend
to think it over whether she should marry Shelby, all because she is
perturbed to find out that he is seeing on the sly a model who works in
her place. While Shelby maintains that she will surely marry him, there
is no question about it. The detective wonders about the aunt, who seems
to be obsessed with having Shelby for a lover, whom she considers a
kindred spirit, both being nasty.</P>
<P>The sexual nature of the three suspects seems perverse, as homosexual
aspects to their character furtively emerges in their mannerisms. The
only straight people are Laura and the cop who fell in love with her
portrait, a sort of necrophilia type of romantic notion.</P>
<P>The film brought out the following observable things about the suspects:
Ann seems more masculine than feminine, Shelby appears to have
stereotypical "gay" tendencies, while Waldo is a flaming bitch; as they
all exhibit, in the very least, a certain amount of sexual ambiguity.</P>
<P>The plot twist occurs when Laura returns home Monday evening and Mark is
sitting in her living room, startled to see her. Recovering from his
shock, he learns the body discovered was of the model. He quickly puts
the puzzle together and learns that Shelby was with the model in the
apartment and that when she answered the door, the intruder fired a
shotgun at point-blank range disfiguring her, which is why when the maid
discovered the body, it was wrongly identified. He now adds Laura as a
possible suspect, believing jealousy could be her motive, as he catches
her calling Shelby and secretly meeting him when she leaves her
apartment, after she told him she wouldn't, and she also lied when she
told him the marriage was off.</P>
<P>What it all boils down to, is melodramatic, leading up to a maddening
conclusion, as the prissy he-men, who both seem to be oddly sexually
attracted to Laura, become the two most likely suspects. The film's
theme of obsession over a love affair, ends on a psychopathic note,
showing which of the "sickies" is capable of murder to sustain his
egomaniacal desires, not willing to give up his ideal woman to another.
As for Mark, Laura was his ideal woman when he viewed her portrait
thinking of her as dead, but now that she is alive, the strong-willed
and imperfect decision-making woman, becomes a greater challenge to
romance, though of all her other lovers, he probably stands the best
chance of succeeding.</P>
<P>What made this a special film, a classic, was how stylishly smart it was
and the magnificent performances of both Andrews and Webb. The former's
performance being done with a subtle wink of an eye, was stolid,
steadfast, and no-nonsense, complementing the caustic performance of
Webb, who is viewed as someone ailing from a Pygmalion complex. Also
adding to the film's aesthetics, was Preminger's impassive direction,
allowing the audience to become voyeurs, with his direction offering no
resistance for them seeing whatever they have to about these characters;
and, finally, there is the arresting cinematography of La Shelle,
creating a moody atmosphere and a mise-en-scéne that is provocatively
twisted. It is hard to find fault with this very satisfying seductive
thriller. The film even had a great theme song, written by David Raksin
especially for the film, which takes the same name as the title.</P>
<P>The character Clifton Webb plays is remarkably similar to the daunting
New York critic Alexander Woollcott, who presided at the famous
Algonquin Round Table, and in one scene Webb is shown seated there when
he first meets Gene Tierney, who is trying to get him to endorse a pen
her ad company is pushing.</P>
