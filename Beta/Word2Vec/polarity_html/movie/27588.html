<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Taiwanese director Ang Lee (The Ice Storm), now living in the States,
has exploited the rich American Civil War history to tell a fringe story
about the war taking place along the Kansas-Missouri border, as he
follows a band of Southern bushwhackers who oppose the pro-Union
Jayhawkers by waging a guerrilla war against them. It is a darkly
violent film that fails to be dramatically engaging, but has its brief
moments of edification as it satisfactorily points out how each side
harmed innocent citizens in their fight and what ultimately the Union
victory meant for the country. But the film could not present a coherent
plot, as it seemed to shrivel up as the story dragged on after its
colorful battle scenes. Taking the Southern side, the film found humor
in the awkward situations presented and found beauty in the landscape
photographed, and reasons in the Southern cause which doomed them to
failure. But many things about the film seemed to be perfunctory and
more like a costume show where the soldiers were more interested in
showing off the plumage on their cowboy hats than in giving a dramatic
presentation.</P>
<P>Missouri was a slave state that remained loyal to the Union. After an
anti-slavery Jayhawker raid on their Western Missouri hometown in the
1860s, two best friends, one the son of a poor German immigrant, the
19-year-old Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) and the other, a son of the
old-style of Southern life, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich), hook up
with the bushwhackers, a renegade Confederate Army made up of young men
from Kansas and Missouri whose aim is for revenge on the Union soldiers
and their sympathizers.</P>
<P>"Ride With the Devil" brings us into a world of besieged farmhouses and
dusty frontier towns and Southern chivalry toward women, and into brutal
battle zones of pillage and killing, of neighbor fighting neighbor.
Everyday life is fraught with dangers from raiding partys on both sides.
The Southern side has as their inspirational leader, Black John
(Caviezel); a mistrustful and hateful sociopath with a need to kill, Pit
Mackeson (Rhys Meyers); a cultured Southern gentleman George Clyde
(Simon Baker); and an ex-slave of Clyde's who remains loyal to him for
graciously freeing him, the wiseman Daniel Holt (Wright). Holt is the
contradiction in the Southern cause, as he and the immigrant's son Jake
are the outsiders among the Southern fighters, as they don't exactly fit
the image of what Southern gentlemen are supposed to be like. Their
reasons for joining the Confederate side is both emotional and complex.</P>
<P>The main battle scene restages Quantrill's raid on the abolitionist town
of Lawrence, Kansas. The bushwhackers massacre over a hundred of the
young men in town and then burn it down. Jake and Holt decide to have a
restaurant breakfast in the middle of this bloodshed and are
supposedlyresurrected as thinking men against the blatant violence that
just took place, as they prevent their cohorts from exercising the
unnecessary killing of an older man serving them. It was unconvincing-a
John Ford touch put in that didn't have the director's deftness of
making it smoothly fit into the story, as it was impossible to
disassociate them from the violent army they were part of.</P>
<P>The goal of the Lawrence attack is the burning down of the school at
which, one Confederate sympathizer said, the children are educated with
"no regard for status, custom and propriety." He goes on to say that
this belief in mass education and the democratic values that it
expresses spell defeat for the Confederacy, as it stands for values that
we can't match. This explains a key weakness of the Southern cause,
according to the filmmaker, that the Southern values are tradition-bound
and part of a static culture. This becomes the theme of the film and
goes for the reason the Civil War's outcome changed the direction the
country was going, as the Union victory allowed the country to prosper
and grow to become a great nation, as their philosophy for public
education and free enterprise took root.</P>
<P>A love story also blooms, as the alluring Sue Lee (Jewel), a recent
widow after three weeks of marriage, attracts Jack Bull's attention. She
brings scraps of food to him and Jake and Holt, who are hiding from
Union troops on the wooded land of her Missouri family who supports
their cause, as they built a lean-to out of mud. They have been spending
their time having longwinded unnatural conversations that sound much
like sermons, so Sue Lee's intrusion is more than welcome at this time.
The romance is broken up by more battles and a horrific amputation scene
in the hideout where there is no anesthetic administered.</P>
<P>Upon returning from Lawrence and staying in the farmhouse of Sue Ellen's
new providers, Jake and Holt find that she had the deceased Jack Bull's
baby, and because of Southern conventions regarding morality, Jake is
roped into being the widow's next husband.</P>
<P>Though this is a technically correct and serious movie and tries to
cover a controversial topic in an intelligent way, yet the presentation
of the story didn't seem to always jell. It was a dull film, the acting
was misplaced, the story was too distant and the dialogue was stilted.
It never got around to being an entertaining film, and it could never be
perceived as just an informative film, because it could never quite spit
out what it was trying to say. I also found Tobey Maguire's performance
grimacing to take--this was the wrong part and film for him to go
through his innocent contortions that he has done in all his previous
films. He should get a new act, already. On the other hand, pop star
Jewel came across as the life-force in the film and breathed some life
into the story about how the young were coping with the war.</P>
