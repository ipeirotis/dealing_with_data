<P>Ok, Woody, we get it. As sad as that is to say, laughing at obvious
incarnations of Mr. Allen himself is just getting less and less appealing.
Perhaps a more blatant self-analysis than most, DECONSTRUCTING HARRY heads
nowhere fast, a common attribute to many Allen films, but never has the ride
been so dull.</P>
<P>A year after the wonderful EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU, which showed a fresh, and
yet more classic side to Woody Allen's film-making, DECONSTRUCTING HARRY is
here. It's the story of Harry Block (Allen), a writer whose novels are no more
than thinly disguised renditions of his personal life. Those who knew him most
intimately are making unauthorized pseudo-appearances in Harry's books, and
they are all greatly offended by what has unofficially-but-obviously been
revealed. Those most upset include Harry's ex-wife/ex-therapist Joan (Kirstie
Alley), and Joan's sister, Lucy (Judy Davis), whom we quickly learn was having
an affair with Harry at the time. The situation isn't helped any by the fact
that Woody's entire life has been libidinously centered and completely
unfaithful.</P>
<P>But now Harry has been invited to receive an honorary award from the school
that once expelled him, and trying to find someone to accompany him is proving
very difficult. When it comes down to it, this is really just an excuse to get
Harry to visit old friends, which is really just an excuse to replay old
memories, which is really just an excuse to allow Allen's self-catharsis to
take place. Luckily, Allen does have some interesting approaches to this
catharsis, and if it hadn't been for his less than standard direction, nothing
would have saved this film. Even with the same script, it could easily have
been downright awful. What makes this film as enjoyable as it is, which may
not be a lot, is the interesting blend between "real life" and the novelized
interpretations. We flip back and forth between the characters from Harry's
books and the people they parallel. One minute we're watching the fictional
Leslie (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and the next, we're back to Lucy, all the while
the exact same story is being told. This, along with just a few very funny
moments, makes this film almost worthwhile, and for very adamant Woody Allen
fans, it may even be a blast.</P>
<P>If you're not an extreme fan of Allen, however, DECONSTRUCTING HARRY is likely
going to be a giant waste of time. If you're familiar with his work, you may
be surprised at the turn this film takes, including dialogue more reminiscent
of Andrew Dice Clay's uncensored standup comedy than classic Allen. The script
is heavily laced with profanity and vulgarity, even more obscene than Allen's
usual sex-obsessed works. This would be more uncomfortable to sit thru with
your mom than EVERYTHING YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX, because at
least that film was handling those subjects with tactful humor, not just
throwing it out there so nonchalant. Such explicit dialogue is nothing new to
the world of movies, but it's never been so explored by Allen. Just be aware.</P>
<P>DECONSTRUCTING HARRY is just another soapbox for Allen to proclaim his own
insecurities and philosophies about life. It's nothing new by any means, and
quite frankly, it's boring. Allen really seems convinced that we're anxious to
hear his side of everyone's story, but this overly self-indulgent film has
nothing to offer anyone, aside from Allen himself. The large cast of highly
recognizable actors are merely skimmed over, adding no real benefit to the
experience. Allen has never been one to create deep, rich, individual
characters; we're usually stuck with the same, fast-talking array of New
Yorkers. The only thing that changes is the *quantity* of these characters in
each film. In other words, a dozen or so great actors only give your eyes a
little more something to do.</P>
<P>DECONSTRUCTING HARRY is worthy of two-and-a-half stars merely on the basis
that is was done very well. Of course, well-presented boredom is not much
better than mediocre boredom is it?</P>
