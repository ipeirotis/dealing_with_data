<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   James Toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff, TWO
   GIRLS AND A GUY, is a film which is comprised, more or less, of just
   that: one guy, Blake (Robert Downey Jr.); two girls, Carla (Heather
   Graham) and Lou (Natasha Gregson Wagner); one primary setting
   (Blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment), and a great deal of
   dialogue.  Embracing a near real-time approach, this is a highly
   theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its
   three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by Mr. Toback
   for his bantering characters.  Fortunately, the film's cast is up to
   the challenge, and the wordy exchanges between the triad of
   characters, while admittedly variable, are occasionally wickedly
   amusing.</P>
<P>   The film's setup is fairly generic in nature, and opens rather
   unpromisingly.  We meet self-possessed blonde Carla and feisty
   brunette Lou, both waiting outside a SoHo loft.  As they engage in
   idle chatter, it is revealed that they're both waiting for their
   respective boyfriends to return from the airport, and it doesn't take
   long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed
   by the same guy.  More indignant with him than catty with each other,
   the duo break into Blake's loft and await his arrival for a
   confrontation.</P>
<P>   It's when Blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride.
   Played with magnificent bombast by Mr. Downey Jr., Blake is a cad,
   all right, but a captivatingly dynamic, blusterous, and stealthy
   piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new
   heights.  It's fascinating to watch this character in his natural
   habitat, and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two
   girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return, allowing us to
   size up Blake not with his interactions with others, but by his own
   innate behaviour.  Whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a
   rollicking rendition of Vivaldi, or on the phone leaving messages to
   his beloveds (Carla, Lou, and his unseen sickly mother), it's never
   less than wildly entertaining and insightful.</P>
<P>   Though at this point I almost hoped the film would transform into a
   one-man show -- A Typical Afternoon In The Life Of Blake, if you will
   -- Carla, and then Lou, reveal themselves, and the sparks begin to
   fly.  (One of the great touches in the film is how Blake, when
   startled by Carla's unannounced appearance, begins to both verbally
   and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out
   of the bag.)  Double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women
   (who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful --
   they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy), an
   increasingly-flustered Blake weakly defends himself with apologetic
   and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs.</P>
<P>   Surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared
   by its trio of characters, TWO GIRLS AND A GUY concludes its first
   sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous
   audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film.
   However, it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along Carla and
   Lou's outrage to full feature-length, and it's as the movie gradually
   transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature
   of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to
   unravel.  The dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever, the
   film's tempo loses its liveliness, the dynamic between the characters
   evolves in unconvincing fashion, and several sequences fall flat.
   Subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made (a poster of JULES ET
   JIM hangs prominently on the wall), and secrets are revealed which
   barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale.</P>
<P>   One key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between
   Blake and Carla.  TWO GIRLS AND A GUY was embroiled in a bitter,
   long-running dispute with the MPAA with regards to this scene --
   contractually-obligated to deliver an R-rated film, Mr. Toback was
   forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy
   interlude before the MPAA withdrew their NC-17 rating in favour of an
   R -- and while admittedly titillating, the net effect of the vignette
   on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious.</P>
<P>   If anything, TWO GIRLS AND A GUY serves as a showcase for the
   phenomenal talents of Mr. Downey Jr., whose versatility is put to the
   test in this film.  He plays the gamut from indignant to humbled,
   from self-assured to disconcerted, yet his acting gears shift so
   smoothly as to not be registered.  It's a wonderful performance in a
   role custom-tailored for him; Mr. Toback wrote the screenplay in four
   days shortly after Mr. Downey Jr. was arrested on drug charges, and
   it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character --
   in a monologue to his mirrored reflection, Blake's self-chiding to
   "get [his] shit together" is disquieting in its resonance.</P>
<P>   While Mr. Downey Jr.'s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the
   primary strength of the film, both actresses are solid in more
   broadly-observed roles.  Ms. Graham is quickly becoming one of
   America's more daring actresses, involving herself in three
   successive risky projects -- TWO GIRLS AND A GUY and BOOGIE NIGHTS
   are both quite sexually frank, while LOST IN SPACE has a screenplay
   penned by Akiva Goldsman.  She's quite appealing here, playing a
   character at once both dainty and sultry.  Meanwhile, Ms. Gregson
   Wagner initially portrays Lou with such an unwarranted spunk that
   audiences are likely to find it either annoying, or, like me,
   endearing.  She tones it down substantially as the film progresses,
   but I found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable
   chatterbox.</P>
<P>   The film was reportedly shot in eleven days, filmed mostly in
   sequence, and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident
   throughout.  TWO GIRLS AND A GUY has an agile, spontaneous sort of
   feel, and one senses that Mr. Toback encouraged a good deal of
   improvisation from his three actors.  While the film could be
   transposed directly to the stage more or less intact, it doesn't feel
   constricted; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the
   background, and Mr. Toback allows his camera to wander and linger on
   his characters in an effective manner.</P>
<P>   TWO GIRLS AND A GUY falls short of its potential, but thanks to some
   stellar work by Mr. Downey Jr., it's still often an enjoyable,
   bitingly funny romp, particularly as we watch the
   surprisingly-resilient Blake evasively try to rationalize his
   behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends.  "I'm an
   actor," he tells them at one point, using the ol' tried-and-tested
   occupational-hazard defense.  "Actors lie."  But not, they all seem
   to agree, Denzel Washington.</P>
