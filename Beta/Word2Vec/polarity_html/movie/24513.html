<PRE>_The Thirteenth Floor_
Directed by Josef Rusnak
Starring Craig Bjierko, Getchen Mol, Vincent D'Onofrio, Armin
Mueller-Stahl

<P>The 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films.  One was
_Gattaca_.  The other was
_The Thirteenth Floor_.  Just as _Gattaca_ was overshadowed by the
mighty _Titanic_, _The Thirteenth Floor_ was relegated to obscurity by
_The Matrix_.  However, _The Thirteeth Floor_, though it deals with
similar themes, is a much better movie than the frenetic, childish and
improbable _Matrix_.</P>
<P>A cutting edge computer scientist, Hannon Fuller (played by the charming
Armin Mueller-Stahl), is murdered.  His associate, Douglas Hall, (Craig
Bierko) apparently framed and suspected by the police, enters into the
simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery.
Along the way a beautiful blonde (Gretchen Mol), more bodies, and a
deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture.</P>
<P>_The Thirteenth Floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches,
choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and
anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise.  The result is
a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view.  First,
its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its
complex storyline.  Second and more seriously, it demands that its
audience think and feel. No wonder it fell through the cracks.</P>
<P>Done in film noir style as a murder mystery, this is a relatively deep
movie that functions on several levels. Many audiences will simply be
bewildered by it, rather than engaged, which is a shame, because this
movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment.  I
recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent
ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie.</P>
<P>Despite its philosophical challenges, _The Thirteenth Floor_ derives its
emotional force from the love story between Jane Fuller (Mol) and
Douglas Hall (Bierko), as well as the close friendship between Douglas
Hall and Hannon Fuller. In that sense it is more akin to _Gattaca_ than
_The Matrix_, which, for all of its cute philosophical byplay, is an
adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever. The moment when
Jane Fuller confesses her love for Douglas Hall is at once satisfying,
wrenching and intellectually challenging.  In its final moments the film
even takes on itself, when David, Jane's husband, who has come to enjoy
killing, accuses her of being the sick one.  Although there is a victory
for the leading characters, this resolution suggests a disturbing
element of fantasy in Jane, and thus a deep-seated character flaw.  In
fact, Hannon Fuller's activities in the simulated world, the behavior of
Jane's husband, and the effects of entering the simulation on Douglas
Hall all hint at similar issues with those characters.  This is not a
film of good people beset from without by great evil.  The tragedy is
not in their stars, but in themselves.</P>
<P>The major actors, all of whom are required to play two or even three
roles, perform extremely well.  Bierko, who will be familiar as the
psycho from _The Long Kiss Goodnight_, is outstanding. D'Onofrio as
Whitney, who plays a pivotal role in support, also turns in a good
performance. The lovely Gretchen Mol, whose elegance, integrity, and
determination suggest Bergman in _Casablanca_, does a wonderful job. Her
voice, however, lacks the necessary weight at times.  This could be
because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is
the script.</P>
<P>Some minor flaws, hairline cracks in fine porcelain, appear in places.
There are one or two instances of jerky editing.  The script takes the
edge off the film's climaxes.  The atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic
at times (yet, there is a clue there too).  One wonders if even after
two decades, _Blade Runner_ is still casting its long shadow over sci-fi
films.  One can see a group of suits in their suite, waving their hands
imperiously at directors like the Emperor in _Amadeus_: "make it more
like_Blade Runner_, you know, dark and rainy."</P>
<P>_The Thirteen Floor_ is that rare exception among Hollywood movies: a,
rich, emotionally satisfying, intelligent sci-fi movie.  And yet,
ultimately, it proves the suits right.  For when good sci-fi is made,
where is the SF community turning out in droves to see it? If we don't
support great SF, who will?</P>
<PRE>***** out of *****.
