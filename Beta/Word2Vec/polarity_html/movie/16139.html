<P>ROUNDERS
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *** (out of ****)
Miramax / 1:55 / 1998 / R (language, beatings, brief nudity/sexual 
content)
Cast: Matt Damon; Edward Norton; John Turturro; Martin Landau; Gretchen 
Mol; Famke Janssen; John Malkovich; Michael Rispoli 
Director: John Dahl 
Screenplay: David Levien; Brian Koppelman<HR>You don't have to know poker to like "Rounders," but it might help. That 
a great deal of this sharp little drama is set in the back rooms of New 
York's cardshark underground astoundingly doesn't limit its 
accessibility, even for those who can't tell royal and straight flushes 
apart. "Rounders"' success, then, is owed to its proficient cast and 
intriguing portrayal of a world not many viewers will be familiar with. 
The dialogue may be filled with terms that only true players will grasp, 
but you don't have to speak the language to understand the words - a 
statement that pretty much sums up the effectiveness of the whole show. </P>
<P>Matt Damon, fresh off his "Good Will Hunting" hot streak, is perfect for 
the role of Mike McDermott, a young law student with a tremendous gift 
for gambling. But after losing all of his tuition money in a killer 
high-stakes match with Russian poker aficionado Teddy KGB (John 
Malkovich, deliciously hammy), he shifts his focus to scholarly matters, 
leaving his true area of expertise far, far behind. Things change, 
however, when Mike's old buddy Worm (Edward Norton) re-enters his life - 
it seems Worm, just out of jail, owes a hefty sum to nasty thugs, and is 
counting on his friend's superlative skills to help him pay off the 
debt. </P>
<P>That "Rounders"' story quickly molds itself into a conventional, 
predictable tale of redemption doesn't hinder its potency. Director John 
Dahl, infamous for his neo-noirs "Red Rock West" and "The Last 
Seduction," gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been-there, 
done-that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between Mike 
and Worm. Damon and Norton bring so much to their roles that they'd be 
worth catching even if "Rounders" ultimately folded, but the movie ups 
its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of 
winning. Any sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an 
unarguable highlight. </P>
<P>If only the other character interaction was as successful, "Rounders" 
might merit consideration when it comes time to number the year's best 
films. Current "It Girl" Gretchen Mol is sweetly appealing as Mike's 
girlfriend Jo, aware and weary of his seedy past, but her scenes with 
Damon number too few to be very effective. John Turturro's aging mentor 
and Famke Janssen's tempting siren, both interesting sketches, are 
hampered by the same limited screen time. And as a wizened judge, the 
great Martin Landau makes memorable a role that's mostly a plot device - 
he's on hand mostly to sort-of save the day and provide a voice for 
"Rounders"' moral. </P>
<P>That moral, by the way, is "Our destiny chooses us," and it's something 
of a surprise when "Rounders" supports this solemn proverb by eschewing 
the conclusion you might expect; Mike does learn from his mistake, but 
neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially 
appears to be. In the end, "Rounders" sees gambling as less a mere 
addiction than a potential art form, but the poker itself is only a 
metaphor for a much larger picture. The road to true fulfillment lies 
within the realization and exercising of your natural passions, the 
movie espouses, no matter what they might be. Here, low-rent lowlifes 
like Worm just aren't cut out for the cards. </P>
<P>Screenwriters David Levien and Brian Koppelman entertain and educate in 
their quest to vividly render a culture that's often generalized by 
movies; even complete poker neophytes should cross the line from 
observers to participants when the movie gets to its concluding game 
scene. Inside every adventurous filmgoer, there is a desire to be taken 
someplace new and exciting, and that's the precise allure of "Rounders." 
It ultimately matters not that a few of our tour guides feel 
partially-realized or that the journey itself is cluttered with sites 
we've seen before, because the final destination is a satisfying one. In 
the end, "Rounders" holds a winning hand.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

"Like so many horror films, this one is set on a national holiday - the 
Fourth of July. Christmas and Graduation Day are also popular, although 
Thanksgiving now seems reserved for movies about dysfunctional 
families." -Roger Ebert on "I Know What You Did Last Summer"</P>
