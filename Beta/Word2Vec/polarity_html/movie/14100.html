54
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     Late in 54, the latest movie about the death of disco, there is a 
revealing scene.  The dancers' fantasy world of lavishly costumed bodies 
is briefly interrupted by an ugly reality.  The disco's octogenarian 
regular, played by Ellen Albertini Dow from THE WEDDING SINGER, has just 
ODed on the dance floor.  The club's owner reluctantly agrees to bring 
up the house lights and turn off the music.  The revelers usually exist 
in darkness punctuated by flashing colored lights.  They are quite 
uncomfortable being able to see each other in full brightness.  Not to 
worry.  Reality is soon banished, and the body is promptly whisked away.  </P>
<P>     Writer and director Mark Christopher takes an almost documentary 
style to 54, about the famous disco called "54."  His wooden characters 
take a back seat to Christopher's laying out of all the details of 54's 
social structure, the people that visited there, and the legal problems 
the owner got into with the Internal Revenue Service.  The dialog is as 
dull as the costumes are flashy.  </P>
<P>     The movie stars Ryan Phillippe as Shane O'Shea, a young New Jersey 
native, who goes across the river to the bright lights of Manhattan to 
make his fortune.  With "the body of David and the face of Botticelli," 
he is granted permission to enter the sanctum sanctorum.  Once in the 
club, he manages to get one of the prized busboy jobs.  From there, he 
moves up to bartender, with all the rights and privileges thereof.  
Bartenders at 54 get invited to all of the right parties of the rich and 
famous.  And from there, the sky is, naively, believed to be the limit.  
Ryan Phillippe, unfortunately, gets the pretty boy look right but 
nothing else.  The casting of such a weak lead is one of the film's many 
problems.  </P>
<P>     Comedian Mike Myers, from AUSTIN POWERS and WAYNE'S WORLD, takes a 
turn at a serious part as Steve Rubell, the owner of 54.  Myers, whose 
sole expression in the picture is a frozen toothy grin, should stick to 
comedy.  He demonstrates no emotional range as a dramatic actor.  In the 
most embarrassing scene for Myers, Steve, stoned out of his mind, 
propositions a very reluctant, heterosexual busboy.  When Steve is 
turned down, he vomits in the wads of cash in which he was lying.  </P>
<P>     Neve Campbell plays Shane's hero, Julie Black, a woman who made it 
out of Jersey to go on to become famous.  It turns out that she is only 
in a soap and spends all of her time at the club, looking glamorous in 
order to make the right contacts.  </P>
<P>     Salma Hayek plays a hatcheck attendant named Anita, who wants to be 
a recording star.  Her husband, Greg, played by Breckin Meyer, wants to 
be promoted to bartender but is willing to steal and openly deal drugs 
in the club in order to make his fortune in the meantime.</P>
<P>     Part of the implicit job description of 54's employees is that they 
are available for on-premise sex with the customers.  This is considered 
a perk, given the clientele.  No one objects, although the clap turns 
out to be one of this promiscuity's downsides.  The other major employee 
benefit is drugs, which can be found lying around for the taking.  The 
story only partially demonstrates their destructive effects.  </P>
<P>     When two movies are released in the same year about the same topic, 
comparisons are inevitably made.  Whit Stillman's THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO 
is full of fascinating characters and an intriguing story.  The script 
is so richly textured that it takes at least two viewings to ponder and 
laugh at all of its subtly humorous dialog.  54, on the other hand, 
tells a similar story, blandly.  If you've seen Stillman's film, there 
is no reason to see 54.  And if you haven't, pass on 54 and wait until 
THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO makes its way to video.  </P>
<P>     54 runs 1:32.  It is rated R for sex, nudity, profanity, and 
pervasive drug usage.  The film would be acceptable for teenagers only 
if they are older and mature.  </P>
