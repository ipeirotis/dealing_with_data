WHAT WOMEN WANT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>So men, what could you do if you could read women's minds?  And women, 
wouldn't it be wonderful if your guy knew what you really wanted rather 
than what he incorrectly thought you wanted?  (And what if your man were 
Mel Gibson?)</P>
<P>In WHAT WOMEN WANT, director Nancy Meyers, working from a stellar script 
by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, creates the perfect Christmas gift 
for holiday viewers.  As a comedy, it is side-splittingly funny with 
laughs so big that you'll have to see it again to hear all of the lines.  
As a love story, it is infectiously romantic, with great songs ("I've 
Got You Under My Skin") and some old-fashioned "making out" with 
wonderful kissing.  And as a touching drama, it has tender, poignant 
moments that are completely honest.  Wrapped by cinematographer Dean 
Cundey with lush colors, the gift is so carefully conceived and executed 
that we almost feel compelled to send Paramount Pictures a Thank You 
card.</P>
<P>As the story opens, we meet playboy Nick Marshall (Mel Gibson), a man's 
man who has no problem embarrassing his female office staff with lewd 
jokes.  He is Mr. Suave, and, after years of being "the king of the T&A 
ads," for the advertising agency in which he works, Mr. Ultra Confidence 
is about to be promoted to Creative Director.</P>
<P>Or he was, until the agency's head, Dan Wanamaker (Alan Alda), decided 
that they needed a woman to better understand the female market.  Dan 
hires Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt), whom Nick believes to be "a bitch on 
wheels" and a "man-eater," in other words, his opposite.</P>
<P>Given a homework assignment by Darcy, Nick applies nail polish, performs 
hot wax exfoliation and tries on pantyhose in order to understand what 
women think about the products that they use.  With sweetly humorous 
displays of physical comedy in this cross-dressing scene, Gibson reels 
in any audience members not yet under his spell.  Our audience went wild 
during this sequence, which turned out to be but one of many amazing 
scenes.  </P>
<P>One memorable moment occurs when Nick, alone in his Chicago penthouse, 
begins to lip-synch while doing a Fred Astaire-style dance number, 
complete with black hat.  Gibson is nothing short of incredible in his 
part.</P>
<P>A shock to Nick's system gives him the ability to read women's minds.  
At first, this scares the daylights out of him.  He learns, for example, 
not to go near a cosmetics counter of a department store, lest the 
cacophony of sounds come close to exploding his brain.  It's frightening 
to hear the mental put-downs of his co-workers.  He becomes so gun-shy 
and fearful that he seems to be hyperventilating.  His "gift" for 
eavesdropping becomes a near death experience for him.</P>
<P>Nick's old analyst, Dr. Perkins (Bette Midler), first recognizes the 
possibilities of his new powers.  "If men are from Mars and women are 
from Venus, you speak Venusian," she tells him.  This, she concludes, 
means that "You can rule."</P>
<P>Sure enough, rule is exactly what he does.  But he becomes somewhat of a 
benevolent ruler, who sees what he can do for everyone from his 
estranged 15-year-old daughter to the suicidal nerd, a self-described 
"geek in the glasses," who is a poorly treated messenger in his office.  
Mainly, however, he believes that he can use his newfound abilities to 
steal Darcy's job, which he thinks rightly belongs to him.  With a 
she's-going-down attitude, he runs circles around her by expropriating 
her ideas after she thinks them.  Of course, along the way, they fall in 
love, complicating his plans.  Hunt's performance, while not quite at 
Gibson's level, is extremely likeable.  The great chemistry between them 
is one of the show's many delights.</P>
<P>Nick's mind-reading abilities make him a lover straight out of 
Cosmopolitan.  He knows exactly what women want in bed.  Lola (Marisa 
Tomei), the sex-starved coffee store worker who finally agrees to date 
him, calls him "a sex god" after their "life-altering sex."   </P>
<P>As Mr. Personality, every woman in the office starts coming to Nick for 
advice.  Gibson turns the charm on the audience as well.  With or 
without the ability to read women's minds, I predict that most women 
will leave the theater totally in love with Gibson after this 
performance.  To be fair, many already are.</P>
<P>Comedies aren't normally good at character development.  Romantic 
comedies are better but they usually only flesh out the two leads.  
Since the writers in WHAT WOMEN WANT are able to have every minor 
characters share their innermost thoughts with us, we get to know and 
care about characters who have only minuscule screen time.  One of the 
best of many small subplots concerns the aforementioned messenger.  We 
sympathize with her plight, even if she has only a few lines.  The 
writers milk them for the emotional equivalent of heavy cream.</P>
<P>The film goes down as smoothly as a glass of Christmas eggnog.  The only 
complaint possible is that it is such a heart-warming story that you 
don't want it to stop.  But stop it does with an ending as satisfying as 
the rest of the picture.  This is a movie in which it's easy to fall in 
love.</P>
<P>WHAT WOMEN WANT runs 2:06 but feels a half-hour shorter.  It is rated 
PG-13 for sexual content and language and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
