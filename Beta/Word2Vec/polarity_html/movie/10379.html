<PRE>TITANIC</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  With a budget topping $200
million, I was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money
toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a
film exciting enough to see.  How much could you dress up the sets?
How many models and computer effects could you use?  How much more
action could you pack into a ship that sinks?  Oh, if I've just given
away part of the plot for you, go back to school.  After having viewed
TITANIC, however, I found it to be a well-paced, well-designed, and
overall well-made movie.  There have been many films made about the
maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner Titanic, but this latest
offering from director James Cameron is the best I've seen.</P>
<P>TITANIC tells its story in two time periods.  It starts out in the
present, when ocean explorer Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and his team
are exploring the wreckage of the Titanic on the floor of the
Atlantic, searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly
went down with the ship.  What they find instead is a drawing of a
woman wearing the necklace, which is broadcast on the news.  The woman
in the picture recognizes herself and phones Lovett, who has her flown
out to his exploration vessel on the high seas.  There she tells her
story to Lovett and his team.</P>
<P>In 1912, Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslett), a young lady belonging
to society's upper class, boards the Titanic for the ship's first
Atlantic crossing, from Southampton, England to New York.  She is
engaged to Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), an heir to old money, and a snob
in every sense of the word.  On board, Rose feels the stifling
trappings of high-society's expectations, and resolves to escape from
it all by throwing herself off the Titanic's stern, but is saved from
her self-proclaimed fate by Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a
passenger in third-class ("steerage", as it's referred to), who talks
her out of jumping.  Although for Rose the attraction is not
immediate, a love affair soon develops between the two, which
endangers Rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the
jealous Cal.</P>
<P>The story sounds very simple, and perhaps even unexciting, but through
solid performances by the leads and good direction by Cameron, a good
movie comes through.  DiCaprio is marvelous as the young, but
worldly-wise Jack, playing the role with the confidence usually found
in older actors.  His is a character that is immediately likable, as
he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a
variety of situations.  Girls are going to swoon over him.  Winslet
also proves herself a good actress, delivering her lines convincingly,
and the quality of performances between Winslet and DiCaprio makes the
relationship believable.  The only problem with Winslet is that she
does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing.
Simply by judgment of her gait, I was distracted from the fact that
she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante.  Rather than
demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess, she
sometimes looks positively clumsy, and it unfortunately detracts from
her otherwise great acting.</P>
<P>Billy Zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob Cal, since he has a
certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him.  His
features are such that even when he smiles, there's something
mistrustful about him, and when he scowls, he is evil incarnate.  He's
something like a porcelain version of Peter Gallagher, but a cheaper
model.  Like DiCaprio and Winslet, Zane slips comfortably into his
role and plays it well.  Backing up Zane is David Warner as Lovejoy,
Cal's personal assistant (or "man" as they said at the turn of the
century).  No matter who else is in the cast, you can always count on
a good performance by Warner, who seems to be made to play the
distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match.
Additionally, there are a number of smaller fictional and
non-fictional roles thrown in for color, such as Kathy Bates as "The
Unsinkable" Molly Brown, Danny Nucci as Jack's friend Fabrizio De
Rossi, Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor, and even Bernard Fox as
Colonel Archibald Gracie.  Nice to see Dr. Bombay getting work.</P>
<P>Also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are
basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die.
This by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the
Titanic, but it transcends this status by putting these characters in
direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain
order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the
lifeboats before anyone else.  In this way, TITANIC possesses a depth
not usually found in action pictures.  You don't just get a love story
with a tragedy as a backdrop, but a very real account of class
struggle as well.</P>
<P>As I mentioned before, the budget for this film was tremendous, and it
certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects.  The
interiors of the Titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate
trimmings and intricate detail, and one has very little doubt that the
layouts are authentic.  With regard to the exteriors, I would dare
anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with
such meticulousness or on such a scale.  Cameron actually built a
scale model of the Titanic in a water tank, but only had room for 90%,
and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet.
Could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater, as the splicing
is seamless.</P>
<P>Also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with
the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning.  We are told of
where the iceberg struck the ship, how the flooding occurred, the way
the ship sank, and why it did so in that manner.  These technical
details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts
happening, and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic
detraction, in addition to the more conventional placement in the
midst of mayhem and confusion.</P>
<P>In all, James Cameron's TITANIC is a good blend of love story,
history, and action.  The fact that the film runs longer than most at
about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer's attention is
held alternately by those three main elements, from the movie's
intriguing beginning to it's satisfactory ending.  In box office
receipts, TITANIC the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable
expectations of Titanic the ship.</P>
