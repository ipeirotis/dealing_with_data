<P>Originally entitled DANCING ABOUT ARCHITECTURE (i.e. "Talking about love is
like dancing about architecture"), but changed because it sounded too much
like the recent box-office dud DANCING AT LUGHNASA, this film slaps together
a stunning cast of Hollywood names, playing interesting and well-written
characters, within a vignettes-styled plot arrangement a la Robert Altman.</P>
<P>PLOT:
Follow the lives of several couples falling in and out of love, finding
themselves, regaining a clearer understanding of the people that they are,
and who they want, and appreciating the fine emotional art of love.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Charmingly effective romantic drama, this film offers insight into various
types of relationships, presents us with interesting characters and
excellent performances from the cast, and scratches beneath the surface of
love and its many complex subtleties. How do people fall in love? Why do
people fall out of love? How do people fall back into love, once they've
been hurt and left to join the Lonely Hearts Club? All of these questions
and more, are touched upon in this film, within several types of variant
relationships.</P>
<P>Meet a hip, young couple going through their first date. A divorcee
attempting to date again after her many failed relationships. A married
woman "finding herself" while cheating on her husband. A husband letting go
of his inhibitions. An older couple dealing with a past "love" of the man, a
secret recently uncovered. A son dying from AIDS, joined by his mother at
the hospital. There are many nuances to this picture, and many ideas and
quotes to which we could all relate, but more importantly, there is
diversity. Diversity of relationships helped me and my gang of friends enjoy
this film on many levels. Some related to the younger couples' issues.
Others with the married. There's a little bit of everything for everyone in
here. And I would bet dollars to donuts that if I were to watch this film
again in a year, I would relate myself to yet another predicament. Just like
love itself, this movie is distinct and appreciated by all on many different
levels.</P>
<P>The actors in this film are all also very, very good. Sean Connery is solid
as the older man with some issues to resolve, as is Gena Rowlands, as the
aging wife with trepidations. Jolie comes out of this film a star with a
great performance, while Philippe is as pretty-boy as ever. Anderson leaves
Scully far behind with her wonderful portrayal of a damaged woman trying to
re-ignite her love life, opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by
former talk-show host, Jon Stewart. Even Dennis Quaid manages to step
outside of his overacting shoes in this film, and offers a convincing show
of a man lost within his own imagination. The only piece of this puzzle
which left me somewhat detached, was the part surrounding Jay Mohr, the man
dying from AIDS, and his mother, Ellen Burstyn. The actors were fine, but
somehow, the piece seemed out of place within the realm of everything else.
The ending of this film was also a little too saccharine for me, but I guess
that's just Hollywood. This film is actually a lot like YOUR FRIENDS AND
NEIGBORS (5.5/10) and HAPPINESS (4.5/10) in concept and style, but its
complete anthesis in regards to character relatibility and likeness. The
characters in those films were too unique and inhuman for anyone to care, as
opposed to this film, which offers rich and believable characters, living
real lives and talking about real issues in today's relationships.</P>
<P>All in all, this movie offers many interesting characters, talking and
living genuine and engaging love lives, wonderful performances by its solid
cast, too sweet of an ending, but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie
nonetheless.</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
According to a story in the London Sunday Mirror, Sean Connery asked for
only $60,000 for his role in this movie, as compared to his usual fee of $14
million, because he liked the script so much. On top of that, he convinced
his co-stars (including Gena Rowlands, Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, et
al.) to do the same.
This is director/writer Willard Carroll second real foray into the world of
"adult films". Before this, he had written and produced many children's
movies.
Gillian Anderson stands 5'2.
Angelina Jolie's full name is Angelina Jolie Voight. She is actor Jon
Voight's daughter. She has trained and performed at the Lee Strasberg
Theatre Institute. She divorced actor Jonny Lee Miller of TRAINSPOTTING
(8.5/10) fame in 1997. They were married in 1995.
Actor Ryan Phillippe's full name is Matthew Ryan Phillippe. He stands 5'9,
and spent his childhood in New Castle, Delaware. His acting career started
on TV's "One Life to Live". He portrayed daytime television's first gay
teenager.
Jon Stewart's full name is Jonathan Stewart Leibowitz.
This film was originally entitled IF THEY ONLY KNEW and DANCING ABOUT
ARCHITECTURE.
Watch for movie posters from SWINGERS (8.5/10), CHASING AMY (7/10) and THE
TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (8/10) at the movie theatre where the characters of
Joan and Keenan go on their first date.</P>
