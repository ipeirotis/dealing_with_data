<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>What's up with Frank (Bodnia), a small-time drug dealer in Copenhagen?
First-time director Nicolas Winding Refn, who is 25-years-old, tells
about a botched heroin deal and the deep hole it causes for Frank in a
week that sees his life coming apart, one in which he may die. He and
his skinhead partner Tonny (Mads), who has respect written on the back
of his head, and who likes to shoot the breeze with Frank about how they
do it to the ladies. They also both like to drink Armagnac when relaxing
together. Their business activities consists of doing some small drug
deals in the seamy-side of the Danish city and when a Swede approaches
Frank with a deal that's too good to pass up, he goes to this Croatian
drug kingpin Milo (Zlatko), and gets from him 200 grams of brown heroin.
Frank says he will pay him right after the deal is completed, plus he
will pay back the money he already owes him. Milo is mockingly
hospitable, calling Frank, my friend Frank, my best friend in Denmark,
and his enforcer Radovan (Slavko), who sits in on the meeting, acts
menacingly impassive. The stoic Frank is a fairly tough-guy in his
circle of junkies and lowlifes, but is in over-his-head when dealing
with these heavy hitters.</P>
<P>The deal with the Swede goes sour, as the cops bust him. But not before
Frank runs from them and unloads the stash in the lake. Yet the cops
still bring him in for questioning, until they release him the next day,
for lack of evidence. They did, however, sweat a disposition out of
Tonny, who tells them what Frank was up to. They have let Frank go
realizing that he's in trouble with the boss when he returns without the
money or the drugs.</P>
<P>Frank tries to tell Milo that it's not his fault what happened, but the
boss becomes more surly now with his good friend Frank and demands the
money in two days or else he will break his kneecaps. The first business
Frank takes care of after leaving Milo, is beating the living daylights
out of his friend Tonny. He then goes to the apartment of his hooker
girlfriend, Vic (Laura), whom he will not kiss because of what she does
for a living, but will get fellatio from her. She is also a junkie, and
he uses her place as a safehouse to store his drugs. When he thinks he
has reached the end of the line, he even promises to go with her to
Spain.</P>
<P>Refn moves the Pusher along with an inward existential beat to it and
outwardly we hear the loud pulsating electric music of heavy-metal. The
film has a sharp-edged look by using available light-  shot so that the
handheld camera jitters- just like the unflappable antihero does in his
guts. Frank's predicament worsens with every passing day of the week, as
each day is flashed on the screen, to indicate a new chapter in the
story. There are some chilling scenes thrown in, that are not shocking,
but represent the matter-of-fact violence that is taking place. In one
of those scenes, Frank is humiliated as he has to kowtow to Milo, who
strips him of all his possessions trying to get back the money owed him.</P>
<P>One doesn't want to identify with Frank, but the film gives you little
choice but to pity him somewhat for the bind he got himself in. Frank
would seemingly be content making straight dope deals for the rest of
his life. But the world he chose to live in, doesn't work in that just
way. The confrontations between junkie and dealer are violent, to say
the least. When one junkie blows off his head with a shotgun blast, it
is played for real not for shock. When Milo's men go after him, the
violence is hellish. Whether Frank lives or not, becomes less important
than in seeing what a hell he has made for himself, desperately trying
anything he can, to outhustle his way out of this mess he is in. The
only thing that stops this film from being better than it is, is that
Frank has proven himself to be a worthless human being, and the film
doesn't take us into his inner being, giving him any hope if he should
somehow survive the mess he's in, he would be a better person for it.
So, ultimately, it is difficult to care that much about what happens to
Frank.</P>
<P>The director has cooked up a very disturbing film, that is derivative of
Pulp Fiction (the conversation Frank and Tonny have over the difference
between renting a video and going out to a movie could be right out of
Pulp). But, this is not a bad effort for someone who never went to film
school. What the young director has shown that he could do well, is
depict the dark underbelly side of an idealized tourist city and the
loneliness of a girl junkie and a small-time drug dealer, who haven't
figured out the right way to handle their emotional disconnections.</P>
