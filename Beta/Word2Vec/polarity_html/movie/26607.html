<P>     When I finished reading Catherine Ryan Hyde's novel PAY IT FORWARD,
one simple thought occurred to me: "Someone's going to have to screw up
big time to keep this from being a real crowd-pleaser." It was far from
clear that PAY IT FORWARD would make for a great film; there were a lot of
plot threads to condense, and a definite danger of Pollyanna overkill. But
there was something primally satisfying about the whole idea of it, and a
kicker of a finale that was a true tear-jerker on the page. Great, not
necessarily; hanky-wringing and applause-inducing, most definitely.</P>
<P>     Maybe a fable like PAY IT FORWARD could only have worked on the
page. More likely, maybe it only could have worked with a director who
knew how to tell an inherently emotional story with some degree of
subtlety. Mimi Leder utterly botches this tale of a middle school student
named Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment) inspired by his social studies
teacher Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey) to develop a unique plan of 
altruism. Trevor devises a sort of human chain letter of good deeds: He
will help three people with something big, then request that his
beneficiaries in turn "pay it forward" to three more people each. His
classmates scoff at his optimism, but Eugene is intrigued by Trevor's
idea. He also finds himself a part of the plan when he becomes one of
Trevor's good deeds, as Trevor attempts to fix him up with his alcoholic
mother Arlene (Helen Hunt).</P>
<P>     Much has been made of the fact that the Kevin Spacey character was
African-American in the novel, but PAY IT FORWARD isn't ineffective
because it's not faithful enough. Indeed, screenwriter Leslie Dixon comes
up with an effective alternative back story for the scars Eugene bears,
and she creatively weaves the sub-plot involving a reporter (Jay Mohr) 
chasing down the origin of the Pay It Forward "movement" into the main
plot. There are quite a few things to like about the film, from Helen 
Hunt's willingness to look positively ghastly, to the use of the Las Vegas
setting. And of course there's Kevin Spacey, who can always be counted on
to dazzle even when the material is less than stellar. He's a fascinating
screen performer, and here he gets at the hope buried in a bitter man.</P>
<P>     That's what Spacey can do even when a director seems to be working
against him. Leder excelled as a small screen director for "E.R.," but in
PAY IT FORWARD, as in DEEP IMPACT, she once again misses every opportunity
to make the film about more than its concept. Granted, Dixon's script is
better with individual moments than it is at building a narrative, but
Leder makes a flawed script even worse. Every shot involving a human face
involves a close-up so intense you can count pores; supporting characters
-- notably Jon Bon Jovi as Trevor's absentee dad -- aren't given a chance
to develop beyond a single note. Her biggest blunders are saved for one of
PAY IT FORWARD's most intense scenes, in which Eugene bares his soul to
Arlene regarding his own past. Leder's editing choices rob the moment of
all its power, including pointless cutaway's to Hunt's reaction shots. 
Every time a scene calls for finding a core of emotional honesty, Leder
opts instead to convey sincerity by blowing up Haley Joel Osment's
head to the size of a dirigible and letting the tears roll down his
pouting face.</P>
<P>     Plenty of opponents of PAY IT FORWARD will probably fixate on the
film's final shot, which borrows blatantly from another feel-good film
that shall remain nameless. Once again, the problem isn't that it differs
from the novel's climax; it isn't even that it's familiar from another
film. The problem is that it's simply a movie moment, one that ignores
that the payoff in PAY IT FORWARD should be the success or failure of
Trevor's idea. It's manipulative and overwrought, but the real issue is
that it's not organic to the story. Leder spends two hours grasping for
how to tell this story visually, and almost never comes up with the
appropriate choice. PAY IT FORWARD is still bound to leave some viewers
thinking they've seen a good film, just because it leaves them a little
teary-eyed. I doubt many of them will feel any resonance from those tears
24 hours later. Congratulations, Mimi Leder, with assistance from Leslie
Dixon. You managed to screw it up big time.</P>
