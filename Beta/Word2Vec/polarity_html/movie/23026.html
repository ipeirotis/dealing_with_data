<P>     When we are introduced to Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), the young
American protagonist of THE BEACH, he says, "My name is Richard. What else
do you need to know about me?" He tries to convince us that he's a blank
slate, a walking receptor for experiences using his backpacking trip
through Thailand as a way to shake up his life. It's an intriguing start,
except for one small problem: There's a lot more we need to know about
Richard. In fact, there's a lot more we need to know about virtually
everyone and everything in THE BEACH. Director Danny Boyle's
travelogue-cum-human nature treatise proves to be a tremendously
frustrating experience -- it's a lazy film that thinks it's being
profound.</P>
<P>     The titular beach is a hidden cove on a remote island off the Thai
coast, a place that has become a sort of myth among tourists in Thailand. 
Richard learns the truth when Daffy (Robert Carlyle), a crazed former
resident of the island, hands over a map to its location. Accompanied by a
young French couple named Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne
(Guillaume Canet), Richard makes the difficult journey to the island,
where they find a community of self-imposed outcasts from civilization. It
all seems to be a paradise on earth, except for the presence of a
pseudo-benevolent pseudo-dictator named Sal (Tilda Swinton) whose paranoia
over keeping the island secret is rivaled only by her libido, and the
unsettling willingness of the residents to leave their dying in the middle
of the jungle. Soon Richard begins suspecting that the threats to the
community from without -- edgy marijuana farmers, more Americans -- may be
less troubling than the threats from within.</P>
<P>     During its first hour, THE BEACH does an effective job of setting
tone, largely through the efforts of superb technical craftsmen. Darius
Khondji works his now-typical magic with darkness, adding a shadow of
creepiness to Richard's cynical vision of tourism in "exotic" lands. The
island locations are spectacular, and Donald McAlpine's production design
of the islanders' camp is a tidy marvel. THE BEACH wants to set up an
initial dichotomy -- the pasteurized pleasures of most tourist
destinations compared to the raw glory of the island -- that eventually
proves to be false. On a visual level, it's hard not to argue that Boyle
and company succeed.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately for Boyle and company -- and for you, John or Jane 
Q. Potential Audience Member -- the characters eventually have to play a
role in the film. When they do, it becomes quite clear that nobody
understands why anybody is doing anything. Richard's vague motivations and
frustrations over sanitized tourist experiences seem provocative as the
film begins, but soon the script begins dropping in details about his past
-- e.g. he's a video game junkie -- without bothering to explain why that
matters except as an excuse for Boyle to include an admittedly creative
fantasy sequence. That complete apathy over exploring motivation spills
over into every other character, as screenwriter John Hodge never bothers
with the tiny matter of what the islanders want their paradise to
represent, or why Sal above all others treats the place as a holy secret. 
The characters -- including DiCaprio, whose performance is about as good
as you can expect in a role so under-written -- generally appear to be
occupying space and serving plot functions, to the ridiculous extreme that
the head marijuana farmer gives a knowing nod after his solution to the
film's climactic problem proves him a worthy successor to Solomon in the
despotic wisdom department.</P>
<P>     Of course, letting the complexities of the characters come to the
surface would have required some actual effort, as opposed to offering up 
the premise as it stands. THE BEACH comes to the staggering conclusion
that a perfect society is not possible when imperfect human beings are
involved (particularly when some of those imperfect human beings happen to
be surly neighboring marijuana farmers). It's ridiculously obvious
thematic material, yet the makers of THE BEACH seem convinced that
presenting that theme is enough to earn them philosophical style points. 
Ultimately, style points are all they earn, though they earn those style
points in impressive quantities. There are several instances when THE
BEACH has the power to grab you viscerally -- the squeamish might want to
turn away after the consequences of a shark attack -- but the concept
clearly wants to grab you intellectually as well. And THE BEACH just can't
do that, not when its creators decide the characters' names are all you
need to know about them.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 sons of beaches:  5.</PRE>
