<P>I'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review. I must admit that
I was a little disappointed by Barry Levinson's political satire "Wag The
Dog," but in retrospect, this has less to do with the film itself than with
false expectations I had going into it. Quite a few of the reviews I have read
led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me
laugh out loud the whole way through, and it didn't do that. They also led me
to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way
the American political media works, and it didn't quite do that either. A few
of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to Stanley
Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" in the tradition of political black comedy, and it
most definitely didn't do that. </P>
<P>That said, "Wag The Dog" is actually a very clever satire on the shady
manipulations of political figures and those who assist them. The story
revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor Conread Brean (Robert
DeNiro) to distract the American public from the accusations that the
President, who is up for re-election in two weeks, sexually harassed a young
girl in the Oval Office. The accusations, the script suggests, are probably
untrue, but as Brean so pointedly puts it, that isn't particularly relevant:
the scandal is likely to derail the President's campaign regardless of its
truth or falsehood. Brean, along with his assistant (Anne Heche), decide to
contact Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to enlist his help
in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear
that the U.S. is going to war with Albanian terrorists and thus propel the
President to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor. </P>
<P>As I said, "Wag The Dog" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as I had
expected, but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here, such as
when, in an echo of a familiar movie cliché, the camera pans out over an urban
sunset to the strains of uplifting, inspirational music, then cuts to a studio
to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom Motss has
assembled to perform "We Have The Right To Fight For Democracy." Another scene
shows us how, with modern editing equipment, an actress running across a sound
stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl
and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village. The most
consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to
forge a fictional war hero out of Sgt. William "Old Shoe" Schumann (Woody
Harrelson), an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho. </P>
<P>Of course, not everything goes as planned; the CIA, for example, realizes
what's going on and strikes a deal with the President's electoral opponent to
report to the media that the "fighting" has ended, forcing Motss and Brean to
come up with a new angle on the supposed Albanian crisis. Still, even with the
CIA's involvement, the film falls a little short in terms of making this
scenario believable. Regardless of the official word from the President or the
CIA, wouldn't the major media outlets have Eastern European correspondents who
could verify that there is, in fact, no fighting going on in Albania? The film
never addresses this question, nor does it show the reactions of the American
public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on
the farcical, such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in
support of the aforementioned Sgt. Schumann; we are apparently meant to assume
that everyone is buying it. There was also an instance, towards the end of the
film, in which one of Motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to
contradict what he and Brean had been selling to the public thus far and could
conceivably have given the game away. </P>
<P>With these plot holes, "Wag The Dog" doesn't quite work as a satire of
American politics, but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these
kinds of machinations in the first place. Brean and his advisors never seem
concerned that what they are doing is unethical; rather, they worry about how
convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it
off. The film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end, as we learn how far
they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret.
Motss and his Hollywood buddies, meanwhile, seem completely out of touch with
the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative
project. In fact, one of the sources of conflict in the film is Motss's
increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for
producing the fake war; in his mind, it is the greatest work of art he has
ever created. </P>
<P>I think it's fair to say that "Wag The Dog" underachieves a little bit: more
attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this
into a four-star film and a classic satire. Still, the issue of an American
President using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic
unpopularity is a very real one. Wag The Dog takes the issue one step further
and asks, what if the war wasn't even real? With this premise and the talented
cast, the film still delivers more consistently than most, whatever its flaws. </P>
