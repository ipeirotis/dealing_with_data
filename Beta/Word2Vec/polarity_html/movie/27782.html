<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A better than average B-Western, set in the 1880 wilderness of Arizona.
Gen. Fletcher Blackwell (Robert Warwick) sends a message telling Capt.
Walsh (Reginald Gardiner) who is escorting a wagon train through Apache
territory, heading for the fort at Furnace Creek, that he should cancel
the escort and rush to another town. The wagon master says, that's not
an order but a death warrant. It results in Apache leader Little Dog
(Jay Silverheels--he played Tonto in the Lone Ranger TV series) leading
an attack on the wagon and then massacring everyone at the poorly manned
Fort Furnace Creek.</P>
<P>As a result, the treaty is broken with the Indians and the white
settlers take over the territory with the help of the calvary, as the
Apaches are wiped out and only Little Dog remains at large. Gen.
Blackwell is court-martialed for treason, as he is accused of knowing
that there were rich deposits of silver in the Indian territory and of
encouraging the attack on the fort so that he could profit from the
silver mines once the Indians were kicked out of the territory. Before
he dies on the witness stand, he says he never mentioned the silver
lodes in the mountains in his official reports because he was afraid the
white men, once they knew how rich the Indian land was, would break the
treaty with the Indians, just like they always do when they find the
Indian land is valuable to them.</P>
<P>The general's two sons, Capt. Rufe Blackwell (Langan) and Cash Blackwell
(Mature), each with a different disposition, go about trying to find
evidence to clear their father's name, but each do it in a different
way. Rufe is regular army and was very close to his father, and when
Cash broke away from his father and didn't see him for years, because of
their clash over lifestyles, Rufe backed his father. They still do not
trust each other, with Rufe being the one who is adamantly unforgiving.</P>
<P>Cash is a professional gambler and a gunslinger, who moves to the new
rich town of Furnace Creek, as he learns that a tycoon named Leverett
(Dekker) runs the silver syndicate and is the one who profited from the
opening up of the territory. He runs into Walsh in the saloon, who is a
weakling and is now a penniless drunk. He befriends him by buying him
drinks in the hope of getting information of what really happened that
fateful day. He also gets the chance to stop a card shark named Bird
(Clark) from killing him during a framed card game. He gains the
confidence of the frightened Walsh, who is scared that he will soon be
killed unless he can get out of town and is wavering of whether he
should tell Cash of what he knows. Cash, in the meantime, has been hired
by Dekker's henchman Shanks (Roberts) to be Dekker's enforcer in the
casino, as he is impressed by his ability to handle a gun.</P>
<P>Cash also has time to romance a waitress, Molly (Gray), who falls for
him until she finds out he works for Dekker, as she believes General
Blackwell and Dekker were in cahoots, causing her father to get killed
on the wagon train.</P>
<P>When Rufe comes to town, having left the army to dedicate his life to
clearing his father's name, he complicates things for Cash and refuses
to believe his gambler brother isn't in cahoots with Dekker.</P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph.</P>
<P>The film reaches its climactic moments when Walsh is killed by Dekker's
gunman Artego (Stevens), in Molly's restaurant, just as he finished
writing a note confessing his guilt and Blackwell's innocence. The note
intended for Cash, is taken by Rufe, who becomes accused of the murder
and in a mock trial is sentenced to be hung. It now becomes clear to the
brothers they have the proof to clear their father's name and tie Dekker
in with buying up the land rich in silver and orchestrating the Indian
raid by sending the phony message, which he paid Walsh to go along with.</P>
<P>It was crisply directed and well acted, and its quick pace fitted nicely
into the stylish way this B & W film was presented.</P>
