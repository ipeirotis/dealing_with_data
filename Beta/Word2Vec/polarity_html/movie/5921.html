<P>     I suppose one cannot dismiss "Star Search" as an utter vacuum in the
history of entertainment if it gave us Sinbad.  You may or may not recall
that The Comedian Formerly Known as David Adkins got his big break by
winning the comedy competition of the now-defunct talent contest a decade
or so ago, and that's almost enough to make up for giving us Carrot Top.
It's hard to explain my inordinate fondness for Sinbad, except to note
that I also loved Bill Cosby's stand-up, and I think of Sinbad as Cosby's
natural successor in the same way Eddie Murphy can be considered Richard
Pryor's.  Sinbad works clean _and_ funny, and he strikes me as an
incredibly decent person besides.  I have always believed that some day he
would justify my faith by making a great film comedy.  But FIRST KID is
not it.</P>
<P>     Sinbad plays Sam Simms, a Secret Service agent with a penchant for
loud ties and unconventional behavior which keeps him in low profile
assignments like working security at a mall where the President's
13-year-old son Luke (Brock Pierce) goes shopping for school clothes.
Little does Simms know that he is about to get up closer and more personal
with Luke:  when Luke's bodyguard (Timothy Busfield) is fired, it's Simms
who is handed the job.  That means escorting him to school, keeping track
of his pet snake and generally putting up with Luke's bad attitude.  It is
only when Simms realizes the reason for that attitude -- Luke feels
ignored and isolated -- that he decides to help Luke become a normal,
all-American teen-ager.</P>
<P>     FIRST KID is far from the first film about antagonists turned
inevitably like the seasons into friends; in fact, it's not even the first
film in which the antagonists are a Secret Service agent and a
Presidential family member (that would be 1994's GUARDING TESS).  And it's
not just a formula film, it's a formula film aimed at kids, which means
that clever banter is never used to establish the antagonism where a
pratfall, a bare backside or plenty of messy food can be used in its
place.  FIRST KID even manages to combine cop movie cliches (the grouchy
superior officer, played by Art LaFleur) with coming-of-age movie cliches
(the first girlfriend, played by Erin Williby).  Mind you, the film seemed
to be perfectly hilarious to the kids in the audience, although I can't
for the life of me understand why a film aimed at 12-year-olds included a
cameo by Sonny Bono.</P>
<P>     Still, as grossly predictable as FIRST KID is, I still found myself
smiling a lot at Sinbad.  I think he is the perfect star for a children's
film, because there is something wonderfully warm and open about his
screen persona.  Despite standing 6'5", Sinbad is more of an over-sized
teddy bear than an intimidating physical presence, and every time he
grins, it seems completely genuine.  He has precious little to work with
in FIRST KID -- a bland mentor (Robert Guillaume), an even blander
President (James Naughton) -- but the sheer force of his good nature keeps
you hoping something will come along and be deserving.  Unfortunately, he
is stuck playing with Brock Pierce, who is pleasant enough as the timid,
self-conscious Luke but doesn't have the spark to convince us he could be
obnoxious enough to irritate anyone.  When Luke gets in a fight with a
school bully ("Home Improvement's" Zachery Ty Bryan), it should be a sort
of comeuppance; instead, it's just plain sad.</P>
<P>     I might not have had a real problem with FIRST KID if screenwriter
Tim Kelleher and director David Mickey Evans had done what it appeared
they were initially intending to do, which is to tell a simple, harmless,
goofy buddy story with lots of physical comedy for kids.  However, they
make a big mistake by turning the conclusion into a suspense drama
involving an attempted kidnapping of Luke (extra credit points in
Cinematic Obviousness 101 if you can guess the kidnapper just from my
review).  They seem to feel that it is necessary to show Simms as a good
agent as well as a good guy, and that is fine, but the gunplay which
ensues is a bit too serious, making the last fifteen minutes somewhat
inappropriate for young children.  Far better to give Sinbad the
opportunity to take over the film, since he was clearly the best thing
they had going for them.  FIRST KID is not an unpleasant film, it's just a
blatantly unnecessary one.  Sinbad needs to search for some better
material to hang his star on.  Ed McMahon would not approve.</P>
