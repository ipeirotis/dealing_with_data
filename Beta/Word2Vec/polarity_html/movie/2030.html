<P>     Jack Kelson (Jeff Bridges) is an ex-con just out of jail, trying
to get his new chance at life off to a good start.  Unfortunately,
circumstances conspiring against him.  His fourteen year old son Nick
(Edward Furlong) has run away from Jack's sister's farm, where he was
staying, and has sought out his father.  At first, Jack seeks to send
the boy back, but when Nick won't budge, he has no choice but to let
him stay.  Their relationship is strained, however, and Jack isn't a
very good role model.  With each passing day, problems mount, and the
easy money offered by Jack's old way of life becomes a temptation
increasingly more difficult to resist.</P>
<P>     It's a gross disservice to AMERICAN HEART to describe it
thematically as a "white BOYZ 'N THE HOOD", but that phrase gets across
the kind of story that director Martin Bell and screenwriter Peter
Silverman are trying to tell.  This movie is about the life of poor
whites struggling to make it in the inner city.  The setting is
Seattle, but it could just as easily be any other city in the United
States.  As was true with BOYZ, the problems--and their lack of
solutions--are universal.</P>
<P>     Set against the backdrop of poverty and violence is the
father-and-son relationship which forms the core of the movie.  Jack
and Nick don't have a great rapport, but as the movie progresses, they
struggle to find some sort of connection.  Jack doesn't know how to be
a good parent, and really doesn't want to start trying, but it's
obvious that he loves his kid and wants Nick to have better
opportunities than he had.</P>
<P>     All three subplots are as engaging as the main story.  One, which
follows the development of Jack's affair with Charlotte, a female
pen-pal (Lucinda Jenny) he started corresponding with while in prison,
is exceptionally well-written, especially considering the dynamics that
her presence adds to the already-uncertain father/son relationship.
Nick resents Charlotte's presence, feeling that she is taking away time
that Jack should be spending with him.</P>
<P>     As the film progresses, Nick gets a girlfriend of his own--Molly
(Tracey Kapisky), a fifteen year old streetwalker whose mother is a
topless dancer.  Molly introduces Nick to, among other things, drugs
and crime.  Despite Jack's warnings that she'll break his heart, Nick
can't stay away from her.  She's as addictive as the Marijuana that he
smokes with her.</P>
<P>     Then there's the constant re-appearance of Jack's old partner,
Rainey (Don Harvey), who wants either Jack or Nick to accompany him on
his next job--the robbery of a jewelry store.  Considering the poor
state of Jack's finances, it's a tempting offer, but he realizes that
to attain his modest dream of traveling north to set up a life in
Alaska, he has to keep his hands clean.  Whether Nick can resist the
lure of "easy money" is another matter altogether.</P>
<P>     AMERICAN HEART throws formulas out the window.  When you expect
something to happen, don't be sure that it will.  There's certainly no
adherence to a Hollywood-type resolution.  The atmosphere throughout
this film is stark, but the tone is not so relentlessly bleak that it
disallows a little humor.  Given the dark nature of the movie, each of
the few lighthearted moments is needed.</P>
<P>     Jeff Bridges, who has shown a capacity for playing grungy,
downtrodden men throughout his career, gives an excellent performance
here.  Jack is the kind of man you can sympathize with--a villain
trying to go straight, and you can see and feel him through the image
that Bridges presents.  While this probably isn't the actor's career
role, he brings his character to life, infusing him with believability
and energy.</P>
<P>     Would that Edward Furlong does as well with Nick.  Furlong, whose
top roles to date have come in a couple films demanding little in the
acting department (TERMINATOR 2 and PET SEMETARY 2), displays his lack
of ability in AMERICAN HEART.  For the most part, he has two modes:  a
blank face and a peeved expression.  Anything else is a bonus.  Perhaps
it's just a case of underplaying every scene.  Fortunately, few scenes
demand that Furlong carry them, and he has a fine supporting cast to
keep audience recognition of his faults to a minimum.</P>
<P>     AMERICAN HEART is the kind of hard-hitting, issue-confronting
drama that are few and far between these days.  The film is in limited
distribution, so it may be difficult to find but, given the
opportunity, it's definitely worth a look.</P>
