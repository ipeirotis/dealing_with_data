<PRE>BICENTENNIAL MAN
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>MRS. DOUBTFIRE's director (Chris Columbus) and star (Robin Williams)
team up again in BICENTENNIAL MAN with magical results.  The movie tells
the poignant story of the 200-year-long life and times of a model
NDR-114 robot named Andrew Martin (Williams).  Although frequently quite
funny, the film rarely goes for the cheap laughs.  Most of the
surprisingly serious story focuses on exactly what it means to be human
and on what is important in life.  There are some impressive special
effects, but the picture is more a charming character study than a
futuristic adventure.</P>
<P>If you've seen the trailers, you probably think of the film as slightly
slapstick.  It turns out, however, to be much more substantial and
moving that you would suspect.  The downside to this is that, despite
its mild PG rating, the story isn't for kids who aren't able to handle
the death of loved ones on the screen.  Key characters die naturally and
peacefully of old age, but they do pass away -- a fact upon which the
story dwells.  The result is either meaningfully touching or
depressingly sad.  Adults and teens will mostly be in the former
category, but younger ones may be completely turned off.  As the
10-year-olds with us explained, it's one thing to witness a dinosaur
violently devour people you don't care about, but it's much harder to
watch one treasured character after another perish.</P>
<P>Andrew, who refers to himself with the impersonal "one," lives in the
Martin household headed by Sir (Sam Neill) and Ma'am (Wendy Crewson).
The older daughter is a sassy 10-year-old girl, Miss (Lindze Letherman),
and the younger one is a sweet 7-year-old girl, Little Miss (Hallie Kate
Eisenberg).  Embeth Davidtz (MANSFIELD PARK) plays the grown Little Miss
as well as Little Miss's granddaughter, Portia.  The star of the
production, however, is Nicholas Kazan's script based on an Isaac Asimov
story.  It's a script that plays simultaneously to the head and to the
heart, asking many questions to make the viewers think.</P>
<P>Andrew turns out to be a model NDR-114 like no other.  He has artistic
abilities, able to make intricate carvings and delicate clocks, and he
has "almost" human feelings.  The primary question posed by the story is
under what circumstances could we remove the word "almost" from the
previous sentence.</P>
<P>Sir seizes every opportunity to train Andrew in the ways of humans.  The
results prove quite comical.  Teaching a robot to tell a joke is
especially tricky since he tries to dissect the meanings rather than
enjoying the spirit of the joke.</P>
<P>In one scene we come in at the end of Sir's birds-and-bees talk with
Andrew.  A bewildered Andrew stares at Sir in disbelief.  "People
actually do this, Sir?" he asks.  Once convinced that this is not
another of Sir's jokes, Andrew inquires as to the typical frequency
among married couples.</P>
<P>The story, which is told chronologically, makes several large leaps in
time.  When we meet the first set of grandkids, one of them dumps sand
on Andrew out of pure meanness.  Never at a loss for words, he quips,
"One understands why some animals eat their young."</P>
<P>At one point in the story, Andrew goes off on a long and hard journey in
an attempt to locate other models of his type.  He wants to see if any
of them were blessed with his gifts.  Along the way he comes into
contact with a female robot named Galatea (Kiersten Warren), who appears
to have his intellect.  Alas, she just has her "personality chip"
engaged and has about as many brains as a talking Barbie doll.  Galatea
does provide great fodder for humorous material.  Her master is Rupert
Burns (Oliver Platt), a robot repairman and inventor, who comes to
Andrew's aid.</P>
<P>By the time the 200 years have passed, we have come to realize that the
movie isn't really about a robot, per se.  It is about love and about
the true meaning of life.</P>
<P>BICENTENNIAL MAN runs 2:11.  It is rated PG for language and some sexual
content.  The film would be fine for teenagers.  Whether the movie would
be appropriate for those under 13, depends on the kid's sensitivity to
the issues of dying.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, gave the movie **.  He laughed harder than I've
ever seen him laugh in a movie, but he complained that he found the
deaths "really depressing."  His friend Alan, also 10, gave the picture
** 1/2.  They had similar comments about the movie.  Both were extremely
upset over its sadness, and both thought sections of it were hilarious,
especially those with Galatea in it.</P>
