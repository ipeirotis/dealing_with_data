<P>     In John Woo's FACE/OFF, two men exchange faces.  They don't wear
masks of one another or impersonate one another -- they actually,
physically exchange faces.  Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) is an infamous
international terrorist; Sean Archer (John Travolta) is a Federal
anti-terrorist agent who has been obsessed with Castor for six years since
Castor was responsible for the death of Archer's young son.  After Castor
is rendered comatose during his capture, Archer learns that Castor has
left a bomb filled with nerve gas somewhere in Los Angeles.  Only Castor's
imprisoned, paranoid brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) also knows the
bomb's location, leading Archer to submit to a radical procedure:  he will
have his own faced surgically replaced by Castor Troy's, then go into
prison to get information from Pollux.  The problems begin when Castor
wakes up, and takes on Archer's face while destroying all evidence of the
switch.</P>
<P>     The premise is, of course, absolutely ridiculous.  It also is
absolutely brilliant, and incredibly subversive.  Hollywood film-making is
built around the idea of the star, around the idea that the audience is
always and automatically on the side of the star.  It's not necessary to
write an interesting character for Arnold Schwarzenegger, because the
people in the audience aren't expected to be rooting for the character.
They're rooting for Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor, the star.</P>
<P>     FACE/OFF, ridiculous though its premise might be, demands the
creation of compelling characters.  For the first forty minutes, John
Travolta plays Sean Archer, the tormented hero who has the audience's
sympathy.  Then comes the switch, and suddenly Nicolas Cage is playing
Sean Archer.  The only way viewers can transfer their allegiance is if
they spent the first forty minutes rooting for Sean Archer, not John
Travolta.</P>
<P>     To make FACE/OFF work, director John Woo had to hand Mike Webb and
Michael Colleary's sharp script to a couple of movie stars who could act,
who could transcend persona for the demands of a dual role.  Both Travolta
and Cage are in fine form in FACE/OFF, tearing up scenery with eye-popping
relish when playing Castor or seething with intensity as Archer.  Of the
two, Cage has the greater challenge, and pulls off the more impressive
transformation.  His Castor Troy is flamboyant, lusty and brutal, the
perfect action villain; his Sean Archer faces the agony of becoming the
man who ruined his life.  Travolta, meanwhile, proves that an action film
with thematic depth can still be a whole lot of fun, riffing on Cage's
manic acting style and offering self-deprecating observations about his
own "ridiculous chin."  Woo delivers the kind of surging action summer
movie-goers have come to expect, while adding touches they probably don't
expect:  evocative musical interludes, confident pacing and -- wonder of
wonders -- an actual script.</P>
<P>     FACE/OFF only really loses its way late in the film, when an
apparently climactic showdown between Archer and Troy in a church instead
turns into a speedboat chase chock-a-block with explosions.  Woo has
always loved his action on a grand scale -- grand opera, actually -- but
the final ten minutes of FACE/OFF are just a bit much, especially at the
tail end of 135 minutes of running time.  Perhaps Woo, who built a loyal
following by filling his Hong Kong action films with stories of guilt,
family ties and redemption, was so excited to be making this kind of film
in America that he just didn't want it to end.  He certainly pulls of a
neat trick in FACE/OFF, investing a conventional genre with unconventional
resonance.  He also challenges the star system of 1990s Hollywood with the
revolutionary notion that an audience can invest itself emotionally in
the characters in the story, not just the names above the title.</P>

<PRE>"'Elitist' [is] a word _meaningless_ in a profession that tries to seek
out and spotlight the best.  'Elite' is from the Old French root eslire,
to choose, and choosing is what a critic does for a living.  Calling a
critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist.'"
