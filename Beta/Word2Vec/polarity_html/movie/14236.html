<PRE>Snake Eyes
by Curtis Edmonds -- <A HREF="mailto:blueduck@hsbr.org">blueduck@hsbr.org</A></PRE>
<P>If Snake Eyes were a dog, you'd put it to sleep.  If it was a couch,
you'd put it out on the sidewalk, where it would sit for a week.  If it
were your child, you'd be reading military school catalogs.  If it were
a ship -- no, it wouldn't be the Titanic, that would imply glamor and
tragedy -- it would be the Exxon Valdez.</P>
<P>(Personal side note:  I saw this movie on the road during a Houston
business trip.  For whatever reason, my hotel's cable system wasn't
showing the Astros-Braves game, which featured a Randy Johnson-Greg
Maddux matchup.  This forced me to pay full price for Snake Eyes instead
of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective,
deserved as it is, should be seen in that perspective.)</P>
<P>Snake Eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie, and good mystery movies
are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of
theater.  Snake Eyes is not a good mystery movie, but I had some
questions:  Where's the manager, and how do I get a re-admit pass?  If I
fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car, can I sue Brian
De Palma?  Is it too late for the Academy to revoke Nicolas Cage's
Oscar?  Will someone please (I'm begging you) give Gary Sinise a role
worthy of his talents?  And how, exactly does Cage end up wearing the
exact same shirt and tie as Sinise does?</P>
<P>The first and most glaringly wrong thing with Snake Eyes is the
trailer.  If you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie, consider
yourself fortunate.  The trailer is a work of sheer genius.  It manages
to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy Steadicam
work, the exuberance of Cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt
Atlantic City policeman, the essential elements of the marginal plot.
The expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of
snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the
gross.  (Is a Best Trailer category at the Oscars that far-fetched,
after all?)  But all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly
disappointing movie.</P>
<P>The trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot:  Detective
Ricky Santoro (Cage) must solve the mystery of who shot the Secretary of
Defense at an Atlantic City pay-per-view boxing match.  Unfortunately,
there are multiple problems afoot.  The trailer gives away much, too
much of the story.  The shooter is killed instantly, so the story
revolves around why the Secretary was killed and who is involved in the
conspiracy.  The film's secret is ho-hum at best, and anyone who has
watched the trailer and is aware of the Law of Economy of Characters can
figure out who the top conspirator is.  Without an interesting plot,
without interesting dialogue, and without much of a reason to care about
the characters or the story, Snake Eyes is a failure on almost every
possible level.</P>
<P>As much as I hated this movie, I must give Brian De Palma one tiny bit
of credit.  De Palma is maddeningly inconsistent.  He can, on his day,
create amazingly well-done movies (The Untouchables, Carlito's Way).  On
off-days, he can be, well, just horrid (The Bonfire of the Vanities,
Raising Cain).  Snake Eyes falls into the horrid category, but there are
a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school
degree-of-difficulty value.  The Steadicam opening scene does a good job
of introducing the Cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by
both the director and the actor.  There is a split-screen chase scene
that looks pretty good, and it's followed by a God's eye view of a bank
of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done.</P>
<P>This is what's called giving the Devil his due.  But the technical skill
doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie.
Placing plot holes to one side for a moment, Snake Eyes features easily
the worst boxing match in cinema history (George Foreman is in better
shape than the movie boxers), a hurricane that exists for no other
reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous
thunderclaps, and perhaps the worst, most overly drawn out ending in
years.</P>
<P>Snake Eyes is a criminal act, an evil waste of time and talent.  Cage,
Sinise, and yes, even De Palma deserve better.  The audience deserves
better -- but no refund, no re-admit pass, no free popcorn coupon, can
ever restore to us the time we've spent or wash the awful images from
our mind.  However, we are left with one consolation, that we were
warned by the movie's title -- because Snake Eyes is nothing more than a
roll of craps.</P>
