MEET JOE BLACK
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Death, using the pseudonym of Joe Black and played with maximum charm by
Brad Pitt, has come to earth to collect another soul.  This time his
pickup is supposed to be the extremely wealthy and wonderful man named
William "Bill" Parrish, played with inviting sophistication by the great
Anthony Hopkins.</P>
<P>In MEET JOE BLACK, director Martin Brest's remake of DEATH TAKES A
HOLIDAY from 1934, the eminently likeable Death decides to take a
holiday.  Rather than scurrying back to heaven, he decides to stay
awhile on earth and see what it's like, so he expropriates Brad Pitt's
body for the purpose -- something just about everyone would like to do.</P>
<P>MEET JOE BLACK is an incredible movie that doesn't fit neatly into any
genre.  Certainly it is a wonderful romance -- think date movie of the
year, but it is much more that that.  At times it can be extremely
poignant, at other times it is wise, and it is always interlaced with
intelligent and delicious comedy.</P>
<P>One thing is certain, the casting is superb.  Brad Pitt, showing a gift
for subtle, physical comedy, delivers the best performance of his
career.  He deserves Oscar consideration although he will probably be
ignored since the role doesn't have the maudlin seriousness that the
Academy frequently prefers.</P>
<P>The camera loves Pitt.  With his golden blonde, perfectly unkempt hair,
his deep blue eyes, and his bewitching smile, he mesmerizes the
audience.  The distinguished Hopkins is equally handsome, albeit a few
decades older.</P>
<P>Cast opposite these two celestial stars is Claire Forlani as Susan
Parrish, Bill's younger and extremely attractive daughter.  Susan is a
young medical intern who falls head over heels in love with Joe -- who
wouldn't?</P>
<P>The story starts a few days before Bill's 65th birthday.  Bill's older
daughter Allison (Marcia Gay Harden) is busy spending her every waking
hour obsessing over her elaborate plans for Bill's big birthday party.
She is married to a self-proclaimed perennial loser named Quince, played
likeably by Jeffrey Tambor.</P>
<P>When death shows up in Pitt's body, Bill christens him Joe Black for
lack of a better name.  Joe makes a bargain with Bill. He will let Bill
live for a while longer if he can tag along with him everywhere and try
out those earthly delights he's always heard about.</P>
<P>Pitt plays the part as a spectacular cipher.  Like an alien from outer
space, Joe doesn't know how to comport himself.  When introduced to
Bill's family at dinner, he just stares at them and smells his food.</P>
<P>Eventually, in an excursion to the kitchen, Joe samples peanut butter
from a jar that the butler has open.  He becomes so infatuated with
this, his first taste experience, that he keeps asking for peanut
butter.  Much later, in Susan's arms, he will finally encounter an
experience that surpasses even peanut butter.</P>
<P>Joe, who thoroughly enjoys his time on our planet, sees life as a
wondrously funny adventure.</P>
<P>The story's main subplot has Susan's would-be husband, Drew (Jake
Weber), trying to merge Bill's company with another, a move Bill comes
to oppose.  In a board meeting, Drew mentions that something is "as
certain as death and taxes."  A slightly offended and perplexed Joe
muses, "Death and taxes?  That's an odd pairing."</P>
<P>Joe, who is clueless about most human endeavors, is given some cash by
Bill so he can get around town on his own.  "You know about money, don't
you?" Bill asks, not quite sure.  "You can't buy happiness?" Joe replies
with his usual big, innocent smile.</P>
<P>When Bill worries too much, Joe gets concerned since his time among the
living is limited by Bill's health.  "Easy Bill, you'll give yourself a
heart attack and ruin my vacation," Joe warns.</P>
<P>In film that sets a new standard for tranquility, thanks to the
director's methodical, dreamy pacing, its few tragedies are so striking
that your heart may miss a few beats.  Still, the overall feeling that
will probably remain with you is a completely contented and romantic
one.</P>
<P>Exquisitely filmed by Emmanuel Lubezki, the movie almost manages to make
its three-hour length unnoticeable.  In its last 45 minutes, the movie
starts to end several times but keeps not quite finishing.  When the
ending, which does take too long in coming, arrives, it is spectacular.
Like the rest of the film, it is funny, poignant, romantic and downright
perfect.  The last scene is even set to fireworks.</P>
<P>MEET JOE BLACK runs 2:57.  It is rated PG-13 for sexuality, death, and a
little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 an up.</P>
