<PRE>"Session 9"</PRE>
<P>Gordon Fleming (Peter Mullan) is in a bind. He has a new, unexpected baby
and his business, hazardous material removal, is in danger of going under.
When he and his crew get a job opportunity at the long-abandoned Danvers
State Hospital, he underbids the competition to secure the contract and
promises to get the three-week job done in one. It will prove to be a
fateful week for them all in "Session 9."</P>
<P>Gordo gets the job to remove asbestos and other hazardous materials from
the spooky old mental hospital in preparation for relocating town offices
there. Their guided tour of the facility by a local official, Bill Giggs
(Paul Guilfoyle), brings them through some of the creepier parts of the
former asylum. But, a job is a job and, if they finish in a week, as
promised, there is a $10000 bonus in store.</P>
<P>As they get down to their work, things, normal and not so normal, begin to
happen. Gordon hears a disembodied voice beckoning him. Phil (David Caruso)
is conflicted working with a guy, Hank (Josh Lucas), who is seeing his old
girlfriend. Mike (co-screenwriter Steven Gevedon) has discovered a cache of
audiotapes and transcripts from old psychiatric sessions (hence, the title)
with inmate Mary Hobbs, a multi-personality patient with a dark secret.
Gordo's nephew, Jeff (Brendan Sexton III), suffers from night phobia and is
afraid to venture into the dark bowels of the hospital. As the agreed upon
week draws to an end, Hank mysteriously disappears from the workplace after
a nocturnal confrontation with someone (something?) in the hospital.
Tensions mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chance
for the bonus start to slip away. But, there is more, much more, at stake
as the hospital and its history of insanity weigh on them all.</P>
<P>I don't want to give away too much of the story of "Session 9," so I'll
stop there. What we have here is a spooky horror flick that uses none of
the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shots that have become part and
parcel with horror films since the advent of "Halloween" and "Friday the
Thirteenth." There is no cat leaping out of the dark or the shock of
suddenly seeing oneself in a strategically placed mirror. With the
exception of one shadowy and chilling image at one point spooky interlude
in the film, there is little that you can get your arms around as far as
what, specifically, is "frightening."</P>
<P>As I watched "Session 9" I became aware of the subtle things that built up
during the story that make it a true horror movie. The striking
high-definition video camera work by Uta Briesewitz (who worked with the
director, Brad Anderson, on his "Next Stop Wonderland")
helps to build up tension with close-ups, fluid camera movement and odd
angles in a way that would make Alfred Hitchcock proud. Music, too, is used
to intense effect, joining with the camera to make simple scenes
frightening, even horrifying. Couple these tech feats with an intelligent
story that uses elements of "The Shining," "The Blair Witch Project" and,
even "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and you get a decent, intriguing horror
flick. Additionally, the brilliant decision to shoot at Danvers State
Hospital gives the film another starring character, the institution itself,
which lends even more chills to the equation.</P>
<P>Acting is another factor that raises "Session 9" above the usual dreck
presented in recent horror hits like "Scream," "I Know What You Did Last
Summer" and their sequels. Those films took good-looking, though generic,
young actors and actresses and put them to use to build up a body count,
substituting mayhem for real horror. Anderson opted, instead, to use
mature, experienced actors like Peter Mullan and David Caruso to fill his
characters' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable. Mullan,
in particular, puts an arc on his character, Gordon, as the troubled guy
who slowly and inexorably falls under the pressures of family, job and,
finally, Danvers State Hospital.</P>
<P>The rest of the small cast fit the bill as people, not just fodder for the
mayhem. David Caruso, as Gordo's senior man and near equal in the business,
shows just how good an actor he is. He made the jump from TV's "NYPD Blue"
to film far too soon and his decisions in the roles he took (I'll never
forget the horrendous "Jade") were less than star making. He rolls his
sleeves up and does the job well here. Gevedon, Lucas and Sexton are more
than fodder, too.</P>
<P>The only problem with "Session 9" lay in the uninspired ending. It takes on
a fairly conventional finale that covers old ground and is a bit of a
disappointment after the terrific (and inspired) build up. The pleasure is
getting there and I wish that Anderson and Gevedon had kept up the steam
they had so ably built during the bulk of the film</P>
<P>"Session 9" is an unusual feat. It is scary, doesn't use cheap tricks and
raises goose bumps with its intelligently rendered, subtle horror. Because
of the local interest of Danvers, it should do well with the Northeast
crowd. I hope it gets the national distribution it deserves. I give it a
B+.</P>
