<P>     Larry Flynt, the self-proclaimed king of smut, as an American hero?  
Unlikely as it may seem, that's the scenario set up and successfully 
pursued by Milos Forman's (ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST, AMADEUS) 
latest venture, THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT.  While this movie doesn't 
say anything that we haven't learned in high school civics classes, it 
gives names and faces to the subjects, and they're not portrayed by the 
likes of Henry Fonda and James Stewart.  Instead of "righteous" men 
stepped upon by the system, we're presented with a person who has been 
demonized not only by the religious right, but by the mainstream press.  
Nevertheless, when Larry Flynt won his case before the Supreme Court in 
1987, we all emerged victorious.  His wasn't just a fight for his own 
rights, but a battle for everyone who cherishes the freedoms afforded by 
the First Amendment. </P>
<P>     Perhaps the most obvious flaw in THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT is 
making the central figure too likable.  He's played by Woody Harrelson, 
an actor who has been synonymous with good-naturedness since his days on 
CHEERS.  And, with the real Flynt taking a bit part (an unsympathetic 
judge who presides over the first trial), and his lawyer, Alan Isaacman, 
acting as consultant, it's reasonable to wonder how much the publishing 
magnate's image has been smoothed over to make him more palatable to an 
unbiased viewing audience.  It's no great stretch to assume that Flynt 
wasn't the civil rights advocate he comes across as being, since, by his 
own admission, he was "just trying to make an honest buck."   </P>
<P>     The First Amendment has always offered fertile ground for 
exploration by movies, books, and debates.  No virgin territory is 
investigated here, but the film relentlessly hammers home the reasons 
why our constitutional freedoms are so important.  To paraphrase 
Isaacman (played by Edward Norton), we don't have to like what Larry 
Flynt does to appreciate that we live in a country where he's free to do 
it.  That's the crux of what THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT is trying to 
say, and it's a theme that is effectively conveyed. </P>
<P>     Of course, if that's all LARRY FLYNT was -- a textbook examination 
of First Amendment rights -- this would be a rather dry experience.  But 
Forman, from a script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, tells a 
much richer and more complex story.  With varying degrees of success, 
THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT presents a character study of its main 
subject, a look at how he raised an empire from a small group of strip 
bars, and the sometimes-tender, sometimes-turbulent love story between 
Flynt and his wife, Althea (Courtney Love).  And, since this movie is 
about the publisher of a skin magazine, there's plenty of bare flesh to 
go around (although, it should be noted, the movie's "R" rating prevents 
the raunchy displays of explicitness that can be found in Hustler 
magazine). </P>
<P>     The most moving aspect of the film is undoubtedly the relationship 
between Larry and Althea, and the scenes of these two together contain 
elements of eroticism and genuine romance.  Part of this is due to the 
fine, uninhibited performance of Courtney Love; part is because Woody 
Harrelson seems most comfortable in these sequences.  Several scenes in 
the second half of the movie, with an impotent Larry confined to a 
wheelchair and Althea strung out on drugs, are heartbreaking to watch.   </P>
<P>     THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT picks up Flynt's story in 1972 (after a 
brief, telling prologue twenty years earlier), when he's trying to drum 
up business for his "Hustler" go-go clubs.  His solution:  start a 
"newsletter" with lots of pictures of naked women.  Soon, Hustler is a 
nationwide publication, but poor sales resulting from candid depictions 
of female genitalia threaten to financially ruin its publisher.  Then 
Flynt manages an amazing coup.  The Hustler issue featuring pictures of 
a naked Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis sells in excess of 2,000,000 copies 
and puts the magazine in the big leagues.  Suddenly, Flynt becomes the 
target of obscenity and pandering law suits, with big guns like Charles 
Keating (James Cromwell) and Jerry Falwell (Richard Paul) lined up 
against him. </P>
<P>     Through the whole struggle, Flynt is supported by three people:  
his lawyer, Isaacman; his brother, Jimmy (Brett Harrelson); and, of 
course, Althea.  When Flynt first meets the love of his life, she's a 
bisexual stripper working in one of his joints.  She challenges him:  
"They say you've slept with every girl in every one of your clubs."  The 
next day, they're living together, and, after a time, they're married.  
Their marriage, like Flynt's life, goes through a series of rocky times, 
but Althea sticks by her husband's side no matter what, even when Ruth 
Carter Stapleton (Donna Hanover) briefly converts him into a born-again 
Christian. </P>
<P>     Why is THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT entertaining?  Probably because 
the lead character is so much bigger than life, and perhaps because, by 
making him into a sympathetic man, we're spared the darkest portions of 
his personality.  There's no doubt that Flynt is a compelling figure, 
but his crusade for personal freedom is only part of the reason.  Sex 
undoubtedly sells, and Forman doesn't skimp on it here.  Ultimately, it 
doesn't matter much how true-to-life everything on screen is.  What's 
important is that THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT tells a good, intelligent 
story that keeps us interested and involved.  Since that's what happens, 
the verdict is clear:  see the movie.  You don't have to like the man to 
support his struggles and enjoy this dramatization of them. </P>
