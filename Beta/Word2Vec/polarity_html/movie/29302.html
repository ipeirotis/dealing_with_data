<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent, but one with no edge to it. It
turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clichés and stock
characters of this genre. Though it's a well-written and well-acted fluff piece,
it still does not have too much to say that is surprising. It's made for the
gentle art-house set, those who don't want something too disturbing to think
about. It's about a critically successful writer husband, Alec (Pryce), who is
so self-absorbed that he's threatened by his department store floor-walking
model wife, Kate (Bouquet), who wants to be a writer. She meets his crass
publisher, Vanni Corso (Walken), another self-absorbed man, and a predictable
relationship occurs. The fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband's
first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and
worships at his feet. She now wants her own identity and her independence. </P>
<P>The film looked like the usual sitcom stuff, and is plagued with the cheap set
design features reserved for a TV movie. The film sagged in the middle of the
story from the weight of its tedium, and eventually landed on its rear end with
its unspectacular climax. </P>
<P>It's set in London, and it opens as model Kate rebuffs sexual advances by a
wealthy American shopper, Vanni. She later meets him as her hubby's new upstart
publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in
order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality, and he quickly wins
favor with her by publishing her vanity novel. </P>
<P>Alec who is an obnoxious grouse, someone whom it seems it would be impossible to
live with, tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book
published--which only pushes her into the grasping arms of Vanni. The publisher
is proud that he's a mamma's boy who never married and is a self-made man who
has earned millions. He has recently acquired a failing old London publishing
house and plans to revitalize it, as he proudly tells Kate: "If my father could
sell pizzas in Harlem, I could sell culture in Europe." The only thing that
couldn't be sold, is this stiff story and tired plot line. </P>
<P>The mystery to me, is how the lovely Kate could like either man unless she was
an insensitive dummy. </P>
<P>She soon divorces the beleaguered Alec and marries the
soon-to-become-beleaguered Vanni. When she writes a second novel, he rebuffs her
the same way her first hubby did. It ends with the same results that happened to
hubby number one, as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper. </P>
<P>A Business Affair was loosely based on the real-life literary and romantic
travails of 
married authors Barbara Skelton and Cyril Connolly, in their celebrated 1950s
love triangle. </P>
