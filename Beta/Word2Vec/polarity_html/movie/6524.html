<P>     It has been a long time since a film inspired as profound a case of
"What am I missing?" in me as SHINE.  This Australian drama has been a
fixture on year-end top ten lists, won a Best Picture nod from the
National Board of Review, and picked up a New York Film Critics
Association Best Actor for star Geoffrey Rush.  So I sat myself down to
watch SHINE, and I waited to be transported.  And I waited.  And I waited.
And it never happened.  SHINE is an extremely well-crafted film, but it
doesn't pay off at a gut level.  Director Scott Hicks' restrained approach
to an uplifting story ends up choking much of the life out of it.</P>
<P>     SHINE is based on the true story of David Helfgott, who is an
emotionally troubled 40-year-old (Geoffrey Rush) when first we see him.
The film then flashes back to David's youth in Perth, Australia, where he
is a piano prodigy under the strict supervision of his domineering father
Peter (Armin Mueller-Stahl).  David's raw talent is apparent to all who
see him, but Peter refuses to allow David to leave home for an opportunity
to study music in the United States.  The teenage David (Noah Taylor)
accedes to his father's wishes once, but a scholarship to the Royal
College of Music in London is too much to pass by.  Disowned by his father
for his disobedience, David leaves for London and studies with Professor
Cecil Parkes (John Gielgud), but his latent eccentricities become a
full-fledged collapse which institutionalizes him for nearly twenty years.</P>
<P>     There is a lot to like about the first half of SHINE, which focuses
on the relationship between David and his father.  Peter Helfgott is a
great character, a Holocaust survivor whose obsessive control over his
family masks a deep fear of losing them.  Armin Mueller-Stahl brings out
both sides of the complex Peter -- the loving father who embraces David in
the middle of the night and the tyrant who beats him and forces him to
repeat "I am a very lucky boy" -- making him a sympathetic figure in spite
of his cruelty.  Noah Taylor carries his half of the relationship as well,
making his desire to master the incredibly challenging 3rd Piano Concerto
by Rachmaninoff an effort both to make his father proud and to prove his
own talent without Peter's guidance.  Perhaps the film's best sequence
involves David's performance of the "Rach 3" at the Albert Hall, wild hair
and sweat flying in slow motion as his ultimate artistic triumph becomes a
mute pounding of keys.</P>
<P>     The screenplay by Jan Sardi explores several other relationships of
David's, but it soon becomes clear that none of them are as compelling as
the relationship between David and Peter.  There is a briefly-explored
friendship between David and Socialist author Katharine Prichard (Googie
Withers), the teacher-student interaction with Professor Parkes, and
eventually a romance involving an astrologer named Gillian (Lynn
Redgrave), yet there is little passion to any of them.  Even the death
of one character cannot evoke much emotional response, and David's match
with Gillian is apparently the result of complementary astrological charts
instead of a genuine connection between them.  SHINE may be about David
Helfgott, but Peter Helfgott is the real soul of the film, and when he
disappears from the narrative there is nothing to drive it forward.
Geoffrey Rush's performance as the adult David is superb, a portrait of
mental illness which is vivid and lacking the obtrusive kookiness of many
screen depictions of such conditions; his mile-a-minute monologues full of
puns and streams of consciousness display a brilliant mind imploding upon
itself.  There simply isn't much to the second half of SHINE which leads
us to a conclusion.  David begins to re-enter society and to play music
again, but the process of his healing is taken almost for granted.</P>
<P>     The real fault for SHINE's failings lies with director Scott Hicks,
who discovered David Helfgott's story and decided to turn it into a film.
Hicks' background is in documentary film-making, and it seems that his
instinct is to let David's story tell itself.  Most films about characters
struggling to triumph over adversity play to the broadest possible
emotional canvas, and it is admirable that Hicks has chosen not to
bludgeon his audience insensible with feel-good signifiers.  However, he
takes SHINE several miles too far in the opposite direction, and finds
himself with a film which drifts when it should be building to an
emotional resolution.  SHINE is a good-looking, good-sounding and
thoroughly professional production with a pair of excellent performances
by Armin Mueller-Stahl and Geoffrey Rush.  It is also too sedate by half,
a story of shattered genius which opts for a dim glow when it needs a
dazzling shine.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Rach concerts:  6.</PRE>
