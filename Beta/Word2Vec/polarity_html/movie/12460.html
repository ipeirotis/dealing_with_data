<P>     Here's a comic premise with all the potential in the world:  a man in
a career where lying is part of the job description becomes disgusted with
his own life.  He has a breakdown, and as part of that breakdown he starts
telling the truth, the outrageous and unexpurgated truth, consequences be
damned.  Naturally, the public responds to this unusual display of candor,
and the teller of the truth becomes a sort of folk hero, much to the
consternation of corporate America.</P>
<P>     That's the basic premise of a 1990 comedy called CRAZY PEOPLE, in
which Dudley Moore plays an advertising executive who snaps his cap and
starts turning out product slogans like "Volvo -- They're boxy, but
they're good."  It's also the premise of BULWORTH, in which Warren Beatty
plays a Democratic Senator from California named Jay Billington Bulworth
who snaps his cap during a re-election campaign and starts making colorful
statements about his constituents in the African-American and film-making
communities, among others.  With three days left before the California
primary, a CNBC news crew following his every move and his Chief of Staff
(Oliver Platt) watching in helpless horror, Bulworth decides to go out in
a blaze of honesty after taking out a contract on his own life.</P>
<P>     CRAZY PEOPLE was less than completely successful because it didn't
have a shred of story to offer once you got past the admittedly hilarious
snippets of truth in advertising.  BULWORTH is less than completely
successful because it has _too much_ story, none of it in keeping with the
frivolous, politically incorrect tone of its trailers.  It turns out that
Jay Bulworth is a crushed idealist, a one-time activist turned mainstream
party drone.  Beatty crafts a solid opening as we see Bulworth reduced to
tears while watching a videotaped compendium of his television spots
bashing affirmative action, preaching family falues and mouthing
platitudes about "standing on the doorstep of a new millennium."  Though
he launches his uncensored commentary from a suicidal indifference to the
future, he finds himself re-energized by speaking from his true
principles, eventually trying to end the contract on his life so he can
continue delivering his message.</P>
<P>     It's a dark and provocative tale, one which could easily turn off
viewers who come in expecting something completely different.  Beatty uses
BULWORTH as a soapbox for old-school Democratic ideology, criticizing the
influence of big business and promoting single-payer health care.  Though
he deftly inserts most of his social commentary into rap-style lyrics --
somehow a rapped lecture sounds less like a lecture -- it's still an
aggressive attack on the Powers That Be as Beatty sees them.  Add to this
a tentative romance between Bulworth and a young black woman (Halle
Berry), the intrusion of the hit-man sub-plot and even a bit of
fish-out-of-water comedy as Bulworth hides out in the 'hood, and you end
up with a film that's more jittery than edgy.  BULWORTH keeps lashing out
in search of its tone -- one moment goofy and irreverent, the next moment
grim and pedantic.</P>
<P>     There's nothing inherently wrong with a comedy delivering its goods
unconventionally, provided the goods are delivered.  There are plenty of
comic high points in BULWORTH, including Platt's superb performance as
Bulworth's ever-more-frantic right hand man and the shoot-from-the-hip
speeches already showcased in previews.  But there's also a sense that
Beatty wants to lure people in with comedy so he can hit them over the
head with his politics.  Even if you agree with those politics, you may
find BULWORTH leaving a strange and unpleasant aftertaste; you'll know
you've seen an interesting film, but you may feel cheated by the kind of
film you got.  I suspect viewers will wish they'd seen more of Bulworth's
comic rantings.  Perhaps this ad campaign could have used a dose of CRAZY
PEOPLE's truth in advertising.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 mack senators:  6.</PRE>
