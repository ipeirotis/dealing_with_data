<P>        In 1912, a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the
Atlantic for America. This ship was built to be the largest ship in
the world, and she was. She was also build to be one of the most
luxurious, and that she was. Finally, she was built to be unsinkable
and that unfortunately she was not. To get a ticket for this voyage
you either: spent a life's savings to get to America to start life
anew, were part of the upper class and had the money to spare, or
finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the
docks like Jack Dawson. Jack Dawson makes the trip, and happens to be
at the right place at the right time. Rose DeWitt Bukater, a first
class passenger, climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with
thoughts of jumping. Thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue,
and a tale of death and tragedy...
        This movie is about a tragic event that took place a great
many years ago, an even that should not be taken lightly as any other
bit of historical trivia. The movie Titanic shows what happened, maybe
not with a 100% degree of accuracy, but it still shows it very
realisticaly. Now the Titanic is both a story on its own and a
backdrop for a story. It serves as both admirably, brining forth an
interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is
very captivating. This movie is very emotional simply because of what
it is, but that alone is not enough. The story is brought out with a
certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more
effective. Movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly
and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by Hollywood
with any great frequency. The attention to detail that was paid is
remarkable. The whole premise for the telling of the story is
interesting, with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of
the Titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie. 
        Part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting,
and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast. The
performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired. The
characters were played out so memorably that both Leonardo DiCaprip
and Kate Winslet should receive at the least nominations for their
roles. Looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they
aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie. The
casting for the movie could really have been better, in my humble
opinion that is. One character that will most likely not be mentioned
by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship
itself. Yes, you read correctly, the ship is a character. How is the
Titanic a character? you ask well simple, a ship had a certain
character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you.
This character is everything about the ship from its specifications to
its luxuries and the Titanic was no stranger to this. Mr. Cameron
brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense. All this adds to
the movie in a certain way that most Hollywood productions cant seem
to grasp. 
        Now, to produce the effect that I mentioned above and to sink
the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects
wizards. The effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to
beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking. In some respects you
cannot tell that the effects are there, you simply think that what you
see is what happened or what is happening(if your imagination is
good). The technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular
and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the Titanic is
unique. The movie will leave you amazed at the effects, and that is a
feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie, just humans
and an oversized ship. 
        The movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions,
the theater that I went to had a few people leaving with tears in
their eyes. Now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies, now
the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with
something of a punch, I wont spoil the ending and say what happens
regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end.
The historical value of this movie is quite high, and honestly is
something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing
the tragedy, for it is extremely well done. The method of telling the
story is also good, maybe not totally unique but effective none the
less. Regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose
production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something
to be marveled at. The simple fact that the movie is smashingly
successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing. If you get
the chance to see this movie GO!!! it might not be the best movie in
the world.. but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time
spent watching it. During none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the
movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie. </P>
