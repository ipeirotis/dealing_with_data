<P>It's been a long time since Walt Disney has delivered us a classic along
the lines of The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast. Sure, there
have been delightful outings like last years Hercules. But nothing
entirely groundbreaking. With the release of the studio's newest feature
length film, a remake of Edgar Rice Burrough's creation Tarzan, Disney
has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques.
It's no classic, but this new Tarzan represents exactly what a family
film should be.</P>
<P>The plot is loyal to the original storyline, as Tarzan's parents are
forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire, and find shelter in
the jungles of Africa. But, they are killed (offscreen) by the snarling
cheetah Sabor, leaving baby Tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib. Found
by Kala (voiced with effective gentleness by Glenn Close), a kindhearted
mother and member of a gorilla pack, Tarzan is taken into the primate
group and raised as one of their own.</P>
<P>We follow the young boy through the years, as he partakes in various
adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend Terk (a very brash but
funny Rosie O'Donnell) and clumsy elephant Tantor (Wayne Knight). Of
course, in any Disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or
humorous chum for the hero. In Tarzan, these characters fill that space
rather inconspicuously. Gags that were magnified in other family films
are kept quite minor here. Most of the characters are amusing without
being forced.</P>
<P>As Tarzan grows to manhood, the suspected antagonist stumbles into the
picture. Here, the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter Clayton
(Brian Blessed), who's accompanying a hapless professor (Nigel
Hawthorne) on an expedition through the jungle. Of course, there's the
professor's daughter, Jane (nicely vocalized by a cheerful Minnie
Driver) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie.</P>
<P>The thing that blew my socks off about this version of Tarzan is the
stunning animation. Directors Chris Buck and Kevin Lima have applied a
breathtaking 3-D element to the movement of the athletic title
character, and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel. As Tarzan
carries Jane through the treetops, narrowly escaping a pack of nasty
baboons, he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star
surfer riding the big wave. Your eyes can barely keep up; it's a
fantastic accomplishment.</P>
<P>The subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average.
There are important questions raised about Tarzan's place in the world,
and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters. There is no
shred of doubt left to ponder afterward, which is a surprising plus that
I wasn't expecting to find here. Suffice to say, this film will have
both adults and children thoroughly entertained.</P>
<P>The grown-up Tarzan is voiced by Tony Goldwyn, who made a name for
himself as the `big mean jerk' from Ghost. Goldwyn is effective playing
someone who's not aware of his world's dangers. Glenn Close is also
memorable as his gorilla mother, and Lance Henriksen (from TV's
Millennium) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept
the presence of a human child. As the movie's villain, there is nothing
particularly special or catching about the character of Clayton. It
helps that Brian Blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm, but he
is nothing compared to James Woods' hilarious Hades from Hercules. A
burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does
not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence.</P>
<P>Still, this is one great thrill-ride that Disney has constructed. I
never expected Rice Burrough's work to be transformed so successfully
from live action to animation, nor with so much emotional depth.
Parents, along with all the kiddies, are going to find much to like in
Tarzan.</P>
