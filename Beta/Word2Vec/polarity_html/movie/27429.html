ANTITRUST
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>ANTITRUST, a thinly veiled cinematic diatribe against Bill Gates and 
Microsoft, is a thriller about truth, justice and the open source code 
movement.  Tim Robbins (ARLINGTON ROAD) stars as Gary Winston, the head 
and founder of a monopolistic software conglomerate known as Synapse 
which like Microsoft is based in the Pacific Northwest.  Gary is made to 
look and dress almost exactly like Gates.  He lives in a home like 
Gates's island house, right down to the electronic paintings on the 
walls.  Synapse even has the government on his back like Microsoft does.  
"The Justice Department is driving me nuts!" Gary complains.  But wait, 
Synapse has more than killer apps.  They've got killer thugs on the 
payroll.</P>
<P>In a pseudo-wink to the audience, Gary says that he's not like Bill 
Gates.  With this line the studio can argue, perhaps not with a straight 
face, that Gary Winston really isn't meant to be Bill Gates after all.</P>
<P>Putting aside the Bill Gates connection, the movie is pretty much a 
standard thriller in which no one is quite who they seem to be.  
Sinister actions abound, even at Synapse's on-site day care center.  
Robbins approaches his role like that of a cad in a vaudeville 
melodrama.  You half expect him to grab a cloak, cover his nose with his 
elbow and sneer into the camera with a "Ya, ha, ha."</P>
<P>Still, as an over-the-top thriller, it is far from the worst.  The film, 
directed by Peter Howitt and written by Howard Franklin, works hard to 
get the details of the technology and the slang right.  Even if what 
they claim to be able to accomplish with their gadgets may have more 
technologically sophisticated viewers guffawing, the script is at least 
fairly consistent.  Basically, Synapse is an Evil Empire with incredible 
snooping powers that it would leave the CIA and the KGB in awe.</P>
<P>Gary, who munches Pringles non-stop and guzzles Pepsi, -- don't you love 
those product placements? -- personally recruits Milo Hoffmann (Ryan 
Phillippe).  Milo, is a new Computer Science graduate from Stanford.  
His graduate buddies want him to take the money from the venture 
capitalists and work with them in their Palo Alto garage.  How do you 
spell cliché?  Well, Gary has been watching Milo -- and I do mean 
"watching" -- and wants him to come to work instead on Synapse's hottest 
product.  It's a bet-the-company project that must ship in less than two 
months.  Quickly, it's goodbye fellow nerds for Milo.  He's gone to join 
the enemy.  You see, we are lectured about how nefarious Synapse is 
because it will not give away its source code.  (Did I mention yet that 
Microsoft archrival Scott McNealy from Sun Microsystems gets to do a 
cameo?)</P>
<P>"The software business is binary," Gary, acting like some kind of cult 
leader, lectures Milo.  "It's either one or zero.  You're either alive, 
or you're dead."  Gary, who speaks in something approximating marketing 
slogans, likes to scream things like, "No limits!"</P>
<P>With all pervasive villainy, Gary and his minions surreptitiously drain 
the collective programming knowledge of the world and pump it into their 
headquarters.  Milo is ready to fight back, if he can just figure out 
whom to trust.  Want to bet on who will win?  Oh well, given the other 
films opening Friday, ANTITRUST can lay claim to the title of only the 
third worst film of the week.</P>
<P>ANTITRUST runs 1:43.  The film is sometimes in technogeek, but there are 
no English subtitles.  It is rated PG-13 for some violence and brief 
language and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.  </P>
