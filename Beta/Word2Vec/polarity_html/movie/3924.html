<P>     This bastard son of DIE HARD--and there are so very *many* of
them!--has a playful awfulness that's missing from the other
summer blockbusters.  Master thespian and martial-arts expert
Steven Seagal returns to the role of Casey Ryback, the former Navy SEAL
turned civilian chef.  This time, he's taking a train ride through the
Rockies.  Why?  Because he doesn't want to fly, or something like
that.  (His parents just died in a plane crash.  Or was it his
brother?  Who can tell?)</P>
<P>     Along for the trip is his pretty niece (Katherine Heigl), who gets
to spar with her uncle for all of fifteen minutes before she and the
rest of the passengers are taken into custody by a band of terrorists.
They chose this train because it's there, and because it's such a great
way to transport a satellite uplink that will let Eric Bogosian (as the
villain, if you can buy *that* one!) control a satellite with truly
devastating power.  Scary.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, Ryback is hiding in one of the compartments.  He's a
master of guns, knives, and a mysterious form of yoga that can hold all
facial muscles immobile, even during dramatic close-ups.  Like UNDER
SIEGE, PASSENGER 57, DIE HARD 2, and all the rest of those movies, our
hero spends the duration of the film slowly staking the bad guys while
trying not to fall in/out/onto something.  Of course, Bruce Willis
never had to undergo the humiliation of falling off a train ala Gene
Wilder in THE SILVER STREAK.  Luckily, these bad guys are really
not-so-bad guys.  They actually back the train up to get him!</P>
<PRE>Grade: D+  (delightful)</PRE>
<PRE>THE INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD
==========================</PRE>
<P>     Director Frank Oz (LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS) and screenwriter
Melissa Mathison (E.T.) adapt the Lynne Reid Banks's children's classic
to pleasant effect.  The story of a young boy who gets to play dice
with the universe doesn't really go anywhere, but the actors are
appealing and the FX are great.  (Anyone else see the resemblance
between Litefoot and Keanu Reeves??) Certainly it's a better family
film than either POCAHONTAS or THE MIGHTY MARVEL MORPHIN' MUTANT
TEENAGE NINJA POWER RANGERS MOVIE.</P>
<PRE>Grade: B</PRE>
<PRE>NINE MONTHS
===========</PRE>
<P>     Director Chris Columbus continues to experiment with tone, trying
his hardest to juxtapose sentiment and slapstick the way he did so well
in HOME ALONE.  He partially succeeded with his last film, the stuffy
MRS. DOUBTFIRE.  Here, he fails.  The characters in this remake of the
French farce NEUF MOIS need a more intimate approach than what's
attempted here. (In fact, the film's best joke is a throwaway--the
characters race past a marquee that reads HOME ALONE VII.)</P>
<P>     The cast is good, though, and they'll survive to film another
day.  And nobody does reticence quite like Hugh Grant, even if NINE
MONTHS is a really poor showcase for Scandal Boy.  Hugh could do
better.  With Julianne Moore, Jeff Goldblum, Tom Arnold, Joan Cusack,
and a scene-stealing Robin Williams.</P>
<PRE>Grade: C-</PRE>
<PRE>SWIMMING WITH SHARKS
====================</PRE>
<P>     Another funny film about film, this one boasting another smooth
comic performance from Kevin Spacey.  (Remember THE REF?)  He does an
Oscar-worthy turn as a tyrannical studio executive who gets *his* after
a year of abusing his fresh-from-film-school assistant (Frank Whaley).
Boasting torture sequences right out of DEATH AND THE MAIDEN, this
pitch-black comedy may be too much for some.  Hilarious.</P>
