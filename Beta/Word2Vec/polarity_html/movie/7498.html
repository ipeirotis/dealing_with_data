<PRE>                               A CHEF IN LOVE
          (LES MILLE ET UNE RECETTES DU CUISINIER AMOUREUX)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     50ish Frenchman Pascal Ichac (Pierre Richard) meets a beguiling
Georgian Princess named Cecilia Abachidze (Micheline Presle) in
director Nana Dzhordzadze's A CHEF IN LOVE, the Georgian nominee for
best foreign language film in last year Academy Awards.  With her
toothy smile and red curly hair, she looks more like a seductress from
a D. H. Lawrence novel than a princess.  With his salt 'n pepper hair
and beard and his bewitching smile, he charms her into staying with him
as his lover even though he is thirty years older.</P>
<P>     (Although I liked KOLYA, the Academy Award winner for best foreign
language film last year, my favorite of the nominees remains Berit
Nesheim's THE OTHER SIDE OF SUNDAY.  Sadly, it is the only one that
still does not have a U. S. distributor.  Is anyone listening out
there?)</P>
<P>     A CHEF IN LOVE opens in the present day in Paris where their grown
son Anton (Jean-Yves Gautier) has been given his father's memoirs.  The
story quickly skips to the 1920s to tell of Anton's parents' love
affair.  Although we come back periodically to see Anton reading his
father's papers, almost all of the action happens during a brief period
in the past.</P>
<P>     The word action is probably a misnomer since little "action"
transpires in A CHEF IN LOVE.  The script by Andre Graill and Irakli
Kvirikadze meanders from one small event to the other with no narrative
drive joining them, which is not necessarily bad.  With strong acting,
characters can imbue any scene with power and relevance.  The two
leads, Richard and Presle, in A CHEF IN LOVE, are quite good looking,
but their acting in this film is rarely compelling.</P>
<P>     Pascal is both an opera singer and a chef.  After falling in love
with his princess, he fulfills his dream of opening a restaurant, New
Eldorado, in the capital city of Tbilisi.  He runs it until the
revolutionary troops come.</P>
<P>     With a title of A CHEF IN LOVE, I expected many sumptuous scenes
of food with lots of close-ups, but the scenes rarely occur, and the
cinematography by Georgi Beridze is pleasing but nothing special.</P>
<P>     The movie becomes little more than a series of disconnected
incidents.  Typical is an early scene where the two lovers go to a
restaurant and become angry because they are served inferior food.
When they see rich people about to get some prime pork, they steal the
restaurant's only pig.  Another scene has Pascal throwing flour on
Cecilia in the kitchen.  She then runs out into another room looking
like a ghost.</P>
<P>     None of the film's episodes are involving, and the whole movie
left me feeling cold and detached.  A handsome film certainly, but I've
seen much prettier.  Even if I credit the film with more beauty than it
possesses, the movie is like a meringue -- briefly tasty, but with no
substance.</P>
<P>     A CHEF IN LOVE runs 1:35.  It is in French with some Georgian, and
both are subtitled in English.  The film is rated PG-13 for brief
nudity and a little profanity.  It would be fine for kids say 9 and up.
I am not able to recommend the film, but do give it ** for its nice
images.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
