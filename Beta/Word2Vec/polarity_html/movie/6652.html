<P>     As bold and dazzling a spectacle as EVITA is, it's missing a soul.  
This brash, glitzy, energetic entertainment has the power to hold an 
audience enraptured, but, at the same time, there's a sense that what 
we're experiencing is just candy for the eyes and ears.  In its own way, 
EVITA is much like this past summer's blockbusters -- lots of flash and 
pizzazz, but very little beneath the surface.  Anyone expecting more 
than loud music and boisterous musical numbers will be disappointed.  
EVITA, even more than the stage show upon which it is based, is light on 
characters and even lighter on historical facts.</P>
<P>     When it first hit Broadway in 1978, the play EVITA was described as 
the most cinematic of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals.  Despite that 
appellation, it has taken nearly twenty years for the story to make the 
stage-to-screen transition.  Along the way, a number of well-known and 
highly respected directors, including Francis Ford Coppola, Richard 
Attenborough, and, most recently, Oliver Stone (who receives a 
screenplay credit due to Writers' Guild rules, even though none of his 
script has been retained), have unsuccessfully tackled the project.  
Finally, Alan Parker, whose previous music-laden movie credits include 
FAME and THE COMMITMENTS, has completed the job using an unlikely cast 
that includes veteran actor Jonathan Pryce, international heartthrob 
Antonio Banderas, and, of course, Madonna in the title role.</P>
<P>     Only the bare facts of Evita Peron's life have been retained for 
the film.  As in the stage musical, she is represented as an heroic 
figure -- sometimes vain and self-serving, but rarely harsh or 
manipulative.  This doesn't necessarily agree with the historical 
record, but it makes for better cinema.  Likewise, Jonathan Pryce's Juan 
Peron is played as far more amiable than the actual dictator who took 
control of Argentina during the mid-'40s.</P>
<P>     Eva Duarte (or, as she was better known, Evita) was born in 1919, 
the bastard child of a man who perished when she was seven.  Thirty-
three years after her birth, Evita, then the wife of Argentina's 
President, Juan Peron, died of cancer.  The film, which opens with a 
flash forward to Evita's funeral, takes us from the day in 1926 when she 
places flowers upon her father's casket to the time when thousands of 
mourners file past her own still form.  In between, she uses an affair 
with a singer (Jimmy Nail) to enable a move from her family's rural home 
to Buenos Aires, where she eventually becomes Peron's wife.  Once he 
takes over the country, she attempts to apply her newfound power to the 
task of bettering the lot of Argentina's women and lower classes.  </P>
<P>     EVITA tells Evita's story almost entirely in song (spoken lines are 
few and far between), making it more of an opera than a traditional 
musical.  There are several familiar tunes (most notably, "Don't Cry for 
Me, Argentina"), but much of the dialogue is delivered in recitatives, 
which occasionally seem awkward.  Nevertheless, in those instances when 
EVITA reaches its musical stride, with a full orchestra accompanying 
Madonna's strong, clear voice, this movie soars.  Unfortunately, in the 
end, it always comes back to Earth.</P>
<P>     The production design is excellent, as one would expect from such 
an ambitious project.  From the streets of Buenos Aires to the interior 
of Peron's house, the film's look is composed with near-perfect 
attention to detail.  Crowd scenes -- and there are many -- are handled 
expertly.  Madonna's numerous, varied costumes add a further splash of 
color and style to a movie whose only serious fault lies in the 
shallowness of its narrative.</P>
<P>     We never learn more about EVITA's characters than is absolutely 
necessary.  They don't become either three-dimensional or especially 
sympathetic.  Although Madonna is an excellent singer, her emoting 
skills are limited.  There's little depth to her Evita, and this robs 
the story of a portion of its power.  The script is also surprisingly 
unambitious.  EVITA concentrates on the big musical numbers while 
virtually ignoring the sung, connecting words that provide opportunities 
for character interaction and development.  Jonathan Pryce (BRAZIL, 
CARRINGTON), who is certainly capable of giving a strong performance, is 
wasted.  Only towards the end is he given more to do than play second 
fiddle to Madonna.</P>
<P>     If there's a real surprise in EVITA, it's the strength of Antonio 
Banderas' performance.  Playing a sort of one-man Greek chorus, he fills 
the role of narrator with an impossible-to-miss sardonic quality.  
Banderas' Che gives the film an edge, and Evita's few negative qualities 
come to light through his numbers.  Even though Banderas doesn't have 
Madonna's vocal ability, he acquits himself well enough when it comes to 
singing, and his acting is the best that it's been since he parted ways 
with Pedro Almoldovar (after TIE ME UP! TIE ME DOWN!).</P>
<P>     A great deal has been written about whether EVITA will be able to 
revive the musical genre, especially when coupled with Woody Allen's new 
effort, EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.  Obviously, it's impossible to give an 
answer now, but if this film strikes box office gold (which seems 
possible, with Disney plugging it so relentlessly), more musicals will 
follow.  Hopefully, anything in the works will combine the artistry and 
spectacle of EVITA with a stronger story and better-defined characters.  
As it stands, this is solid entertainment, but the potential exists for 
something richer and more satisfying. </P>
