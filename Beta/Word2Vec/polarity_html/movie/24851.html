<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A sometimes funny parody and uncanny black comedy, about incest, sexual
repression, and the Jewish mob. But its failure to be consistently on
focus with its characters' comings and goings, in what seems like a
pointless amount of gore being displayed, acts to undermine the film's
artful plot set-up. As the film is too often off target, bringing up too
many subjects for it to handle, it just fires away, taking aim at
everything in its way and missing just as often as it hits.</P>
<P>It is set in the seedy neighborhoods of Youngstown, Ohio, and its focus
is on a gentile, overbearing mother and her psychopathic son, who live
in a depressing house. Kate Odum (Deborah Harry) is the mother who still
bathes her son and dominates his life by keeping him from girls, telling
him women just want to use sex to get their hooks in a guy, "Girls today
are no good. They're sluts."While she acts to discourage him about sex,
yet she flaunts her sex in front of him, wearing sexy underclothes in
front of him. He is a repressed, virginal 18-year-old, named Harry
(Norman Reedus-ex-model for Prado), with deep-rooted psychological
problems. He talks to his alter ego, whom he names Madden (Graham), and
easily loses sight of reality, not able to tell at times if he is Madden
or himself. Madden is everything he is not, self-assured and sexually
fit. In otherwords, Harry is a certifiable nutcase.</P>
<P>Harry has conflicting feelings about sex, sometimes when frustrated, he
gets very angry and violent, but at other times he is like a docile
lamb. He works at odd-jobs and at a fast-food place. When he goes out
for the first time on a "schlumping" with his best friend Arnie
Finklestein (Brody), who is a crack addict working for the Jewish mob,
he gets to beat an owner of a strip-joint senseless after watching the
nude dancers perform. What upsets him after he sees the naked women, is
that Arnie does not beat the guy hard enough. He is welcomed into the
mob because, as Arnie's mobster boss says, the deadbeat learnt his
lesson and paid the loan sharks off what he owes them.</P>
<P>The hitman for the gang, Abie Pinkwise (Peter Appel), an orphan but
raised by a gangster uncle, takes it upon himself to teach Harry the
ropes, and makes him his right-hand enforcer. While visiting the big
bosses' house, Louis Varga (Adler), Harry eyeballs a Hungarian immigrant
maid, Iris (Lowensohn), and is attracted to her because she walks with a
limp and he thereby strikes up a strange romance with her. But his
mother acts to thwart that romance when he brings her over to the house.
Mama can never let go of her little baby boy.</P>
<P>How the film got its title, is forced into one of the scenes, when a
policeman on the mob's payroll, Isaac Hayes, beats Harry up in the
stationhouse to determine if he's a squealer, but Harry fights back and
busts his nose. The breaking of the nose gives rise to the saying, I
could have beaten him six ways to Sunday.</P>
<P>Harry becomes a full-fledged hitman, and gets to enjoy doing some
violent hits. His mentor Abie treats him like a son, while his boss
Louis is pleased with his work and rewards him with a lot of money.
Harry, as a result, buys his mother a new house, though she still brings
with her all her old junk, the main staple being, a living room lounge
chair that sags to the floor when you sit on it.</P>
<P>There is no smooth sailing in this difficult story to behold, which
might have something to do with love. If love is the message here, it is
not the conventional kind, but it is one that is stranger and stronger
than Harry's repressions, hatred and violence. Everytime one looks up on
the screen, someone seems to be getting violently bumped off, yet Harry
manages to survive and will leave Youngstown with Iris by the film's
end, which, oddly enough, after all the mayhem and absurdity of Harry's
insane life, the film turns out to have a temporarily happy ending. This
might be the strangest thing about this film, for a film that has gone
out of its way to be stranger than fiction or love. This film should
appeal mostly to those who like offbeat stories and their comedy to be
darker than black, and don't mind if confusion is the main ingredient
that propels the story. I took it at face value to be black comedy and
found myself laughing often, though the people I saw it with, thought it
was over-the-top in blood and gore, and found little in it to like and
found the film was far too self-indulgent to work as a love story for
them.</P>
