<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Cameron Crowe (Say Anything.../Singles/Jerry Maguire) is the
writer-director of his fourth film, an endearing and sleekly
fictionalized semiautobiographical coming-of-age rock 'n' roll film,
that also explores the ethical relationship of a young aspiring writer
to the musicians he covers. Crowe started out as a rock writer at 15 and
joined the staff of Rolling Stone when he was 16.</P>
<P>"Almost Famous" knows exactly what buttons to push to engage the
audience in its very gentle and touching tale of a 15-year-old
precocious San Diego native, the drug-free William Miller (Patrick
Fugit), and his flight from his overprotective though loving college
professor, mother, Elaine (Frances McDormand), whose role as mother is
to warn him not to take drugs. Her strictness chased his older sister
(Zooey) out of the house to become a stewardess in 1969, but she leaves
her rock collection behind with her brother, thus getting him interested
in the music. To explain her reasons for doing what she did, she plays
her mother a cut from a Simon and Garfunkel album: "I walked out to look
for America." For those with a sense of nostalgia for that period, it
was fun looking at how colorful those rock album covers were back then,
as William goes through his sister's collection, which includes the
artistically designed albums of Led Zeppelin, The Who, and Bob Dylan.</P>
<P>William scores a journalist deal with Rolling Stone magazine, after he
sneaks in with the help of some groupies to see Stillwater, after being
kicked out by the bouncer to see the real group Black Sabbath. Rolling
Stone asks him to write a story about the rising four-man band
Stillwater, with its leader, the guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy
Crudup) and singer Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee), on their cross-country 1973
tour. The film is not raucous rock, but offers a sweet view of the music
world, pointing out why its popularity is high among adolescents, while
also exploring its business side.</P>
<P>The casting was perfecto, not that the acting was necessarily arresting,
but it was that everyone seemed natural for their roles and gave
expression and a sense of truth to what was happening.</P>
<P>I always enjoy watching Philip Seymour Hoffman perform and was very
pleased with him in this role, here he has a small supporting role as
Lester Bangs, the wizened music critic of a rock magazine called Creem,
who acts as a mentor to William. He forms an uncool but smart guy pact
with him, warning that commercialism and uncritical journalists will
kill this music, which is really dead already but doesn't know it. His
caveat to William is: don't make friends with the performers, they are
just trying to use you. All you can do is write about them honestly.
That will be the mantra of the film and also its hardest attack on the
industry, but it is carried out to perfection by this great cast and
directed with a sure-hand for drawing out the comedy and whatever
goodness there is in the artists and the groupies who follow them.</P>
<P>A large portion of the film is about the groupies who hang around with
the musicians, smoking dope and balling them, as this film distinguishes
between groupies and "band aids", who claim they are devotees of the
music more than they are just in it for the thrill of sleeping with a
celebrity. But the film will go on to show that everyone connected with
the music is delusional, the musicians are not as serious about their
music as they pretend to be and the "band aids" are only fooling
themself if they think they're not groupies, as they stroke their
unsatisfied egos by basking in the glory of someone else. One such "band
aid" is the lovely teenager Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), who is Russell's
girl on the road, when his girlfriend is at home. Penny's relationship
with William and Russell becomes the focal point of the film, as she
lights up the screen with her rich presence and adorable charm.</P>
<P>What William sees on the rock tour is a fantasy world of drugs, easy
sex, and an aura of coolness in the band he writes about. He develops a
loving relationship with Penny Lane, trying to understand why she does
what she does, but is also overawed by the band accepting a square like
him into their cool world, which is the natural way for a teen to feel,
especially one who comes under the influence of the band'd charismatic
leader Russell. He, thusly, fails to heed Lester's advise.</P>
<P>The band considers the journalist the enemy and wish to compromise
William so that he will only write a story making them look cool, as
they give him access to their lives and expect him to come through for
them. While Penny looks to William as an ally, someone she can trust,
who is in the same fringe position with the group as she is. She along
with two other groupies deflower William, which brings him down to the
same level as they are.</P>
<P>This is not a provocative film, as it is a film of small observations as
seen through the youngster's eyes and heard on the tape recordings he
makes as he interviews them, as he goes backstage, sits with them in
their tour bus, swings with the groupies in their hotel, and goes to
their parties, witnessing how high they get on mind- altering drugs and
sees first-hand how insecure they are as performers. He also corresponds
with Rolling Stone, which is on about the same superficial level as the
band members as purveyors of hipness, thinking that rock 'n' roll will
change the world, though the magazine has the smug belief that they are
above the fray.</P>
<P>What I thoroughly enjoyed about the film was the casual way it let its
characters act and be themselves, even if it was rehashing characters
and rock music scenes played out in many such films, but here it seemed
to be very easy to absorb and take in without dissecting that 1970s
hippie scene. Instead, it let the story make whatever sense it could
without going overboard. I doubt very much if the film caught the
full-flavor of that period, but it did catch what it had to, and all the
characters avoided falling into being stereotypes.</P>
<P>Billy Crudup is a very fine actor and he is able to be different things
to different people in this film without making it seem as if he were
disingenuous. To Penny, he is her escape from reality, ditto for
William, but to the other band members he's part of their mealticket,
but they know that he is only out for himself, while to William's
mother, he's a bad influence, someone who advocates the drug music she
believes is destroying the younger generation.</P>
<P>The film might not have been flawless, with some mild lapses in
character development (groupies were thinly sketched) and the story
resolvement was not convincing (a contrived bumpy plane landing scene,
where the band fearing death confess what they really think of each
other), but the overall zeal of the film overtakes those gaffs and
allows the film to be much better than being merely a nostalgia film,
and much more entertaining than any serious rock film I have seen.
Cameron Crowe seems to have found a niche in making teen films that are
much better than teen films. He seems to have an ageless sympathy for
teenagers and for those who teens idolize, not categorizing them as
either good or bad people. Also, this film is suitable for both parents
and kids, R rating or not, which is not an easy chore to accomplish when
making a hip film. But moms should like it, as the Frances McDormand
characterization was more eccentric and mannered than one-dimensional,
and after all, the kid listened to her and didn't take any drugs (at
least it wasn't shown in the story). It should also be noted that the
director knows his rock music scene and even caught the scene at the now
defunct Max's Kansas City, a 1970s rock hangout that freaks like Lou
Reed and scores of rockers frequented as their holy shrine, it was one
of the famous places in NYC where rockers crossed paths with groupies.</P>
