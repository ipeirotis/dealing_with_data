<PRE>                                    GO FISH
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Guinevere Turner, V. S. Brodie, T. Wendy McMillan,
Anastasia Sharp, Migdalia Melendez.
Screenplay:  Rose Troche & Guinevere Turner.
Director:  Rose Troche.</P>
<P>     The problem with nearly every mainstream film dealing with
lesbians is that they have been just so *serious*.  If you believed
what you saw on the screen, you'd think that every lesbian relationship
involved a "fallen" heterosexual grappling in anguish with her sexual
identity.  Even at their best, such "love-that-dare-not-speak-its-name"
melodramas painted a picture that just didn't gibe the reality I have
seen.  What a breath of fresh air GO FISH is: a low-budget romantic
comedy finally showing lesbians having fun and leading day-to-day
lives.  Though uneven and amateurish enough to be occasionally
distracting, GO FISH is mostly a frisky and funny pleasure, playing
like a sort of WHEN SALLY MET SALLY....</P>
<P>     Co-scripter Guinevere Turner stars as Max, an introspective young
student who describes herself as "a carefree, single lesbo lookin' for
love."  Among those who try to help Max in her search for Ms. Right are
Max's roommate Kia (T. Wendy McMillan), a sarcastic teacher; Kia's
partner Evy (Migdalia Melendez); and gleefully promiscuous Daria
(Anastasia Sharp).  Eventually they conspire to set Max up with Daria's
roommate Ely (V. S. Brodie), a timid and plain-looking veterinary
assistant clinging to a moribund long-distance relationship.  As Max
and Ely take the tentative first steps toward a relationship, their
friends gather to analyze their progress, and to discuss other topics
near and dear to them.</P>
<P>     GO FISH was a labor of love and a financial nightmare for Turner
and co-scripter/director Rose Troche, so it may seem unfair to
criticize the erratic film quality and choppy editing.  However, many
of the rookie mistakes Troche makes are difficult to pass off on
economics.  Between scenes, she often inserts self-consciously artsy
snippets of flashing lights, folded hands and spinning tops, and they
just aren't in synch with the otherwise light-hearted film.  Ditto for
the lengthy dream sequence in which Daria is subjected to the scorn and
criticism of other lesbians for having sex with a man.  It was as
though Troche wasn't sure she was ever going to get a chance to make a
movie again, and thus threw every idea she had into this one, resulting
in a somewhat scattered final product.</P>
<P>     Troche is also at the mercy of her mostly non-professional cast,
and they in turn are at the mercy of some occasionally very sketchy
characters.  The best role belongs to Turner, an appealing presence
with self-effacing humor.  Max is the youngest and least experienced of
the principal characters, and Turner sells her insecurity.  Also solid
is T. Wendy McMillan's Kia, a veteran of the lesbian wars who acts as a
sort of mentor to Max.  She delivers shome sharp lines with a wry wit,
and anchors the scenes in which she, Evy, Daria and Daria's
amour-du-jour comment on Max and Ely's relationship.  Not so fortunate
is V. S. Brodie, who stumbles her way through a part written more
through other characters observations than through anything Ely says or
does.  While I have no problem with the idea that Max might see past
Ely's unconventional looks, I would expect there to be a more
interesting personality for her to find there.</P>
<P>     As underdeveloped as some of the characters might be, they still
have plenty of funny things to say.  In the film's opening scene, Kia
leads a class in speculating on what historical figures, celebrities,
and even fictional characters might have been lesbians.  The "talking
heads" scenes are particularly entertaining, chief among them a
discussion of preferred terms for the female genitalia.  One late
sequence shows Max and Ely individually describing a date to their
friends, accompanied by hilariously off-base, RASHOMON-like
interpretations of those events depicted on screen.  And in the film's
sweetest and funniest moment, Ely practically skips home after a
particularly good evening with Max.  Yet as amusing as GO FISH is, it
is not without some frank observations on what it means to be a lesbian
in the 1990's.  A pair of scenes narrated through Max's journal entries
are extremely potent, bringing across both the commonality of the need
for love and the unique concerns of these women.  GO FISH is not
without its bumps and flaws, but it is both funny enough and insightful
enough to warrant casting a line into its deep waters.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 fish:  6.</PRE>
