<P>     Canadian musician and composer Glenn Gould was born in Toronto in 
1932.  By the age of three, his gifts were apparent, and he was 
performing professionally nine years later.  Gould became one of the 
world's most renowned classical performers, making more than 60 
recordings, as well as working in the fields of publishing, 
conducting, radio and television broadcasting, and scoring feature 
films.  His version of Bach's "Goldberg Variations" is definitive, and 
was included as one of the samples of humanity's best on both Voyager 
spacecraft.  Gould died of a stoke in 1982 at the age of 50. </P>
<P>     THIRTY-TWO SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD presents a unique, 
impressionistic look at the offbeat musician.  Instead of giving a 
chronological view of Gould's life, writer/director Francois Girard 
has elected to present a variety of snapshots, including recreations 
of actual events (with Gould played brilliantly by Colm Feore) and 
interviews with real-life contemporaries and friends.  Says Girard:  
"As Gould was such a complex character, the biggest problem was to 
find a way to look at his work and deal with his visions.  The film is 
built of fragments, each one trying to capture an aspect of Gould.  
There is no way of putting Gould in one box.  The film gives the 
viewer 32 impressions of him.  I didn't want to reduce him to one 
dimension." </P>
<P>     Give Girard credit for understanding his subject and the best method 
of portraying him.  The character and personality of Glenn Gould come 
across brilliantly in this film.  While nothing ninety-three minutes 
in length can hope to express all the facets of a man of Gould's 
depth, glimpses of elements lead to an understanding of the whole. </P>
<P>     There are indeed 32 episodes, ranging in length from under one 
minute to just over six.  Five of these are interviews, several have no 
dialogue, and three show Colm Feore's Gould wandering a winterscape.  
The most original two segments are "Gould Meets McLaren", which 
features animated spheres dancing to Gould's music, and "Pills", which 
contains closeups of all the various medicines resident in the 
musician's bathroom. </P>
<P>     Some of the episodes are funny; some are poignant.  In "Crossed 
Paths", Gould's friends recall his love of talking.  One man remembers 
falling asleep while on the phone with Gould, then waking up hours 
later to find that the one-sided conversation was still in progress.  
"The Tip" recounts how Gould made a killing on the stock market by 
defying the advice of his broker.  "Motel Wawa" presents Gould's views 
on the supernatural and the afterlife, which leads directly into 
"Forty-Nine", in which the musician expresses his fear of turning that 
age because the digits (four and nine) add up to thirteen. </P>
<P>     Colm Feore captures Gould perfectly, bringing his energy and 
restlessness, as well as his quiet aloofness, to the screen.  Because 
of the unusual nature of THIRTY-TWO SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD, 
it's easy to forget that we're watching an actor play Gould, not the 
man himself, and Feore does nothing to spoil the illusion. </P>
<P>     In "Lake Simcoe", one of the movie's first segments, Gould states, 
"I'm fortunate to have been brought up in an environment where music 
was always present."  The same can be said of THIRTY-TWO SHORT FILMS, 
where Gould's recordings form a backdrop to nearly every scene.  This 
is a movie to be savored by those who are familiar with the work of 
Glenn Gould, and an opportunity for those who aren't to explore the 
essence of a rare musical genius.  It's an eclectic film, and an 
astonishing portrait. </P>
