<P>     Viewers of THE AGE OF INNOCENCE will likely fall into one of two
camps: those who consider it a minor masterpiece, and those who
consider it a huge bore.  There is something to be said for both
sides.  Director Martin Scorsese has crafted a sumptuous and dazzling
visual feast from Edith Wharton's novel of social propriety and
repressed desire, but one that suffers from an overlong second act and
a lack of character depth.  While still an exceptional film experience,
it is ultimately one which I found much more engaging intellectually
than emotionally.</P>
<P>     THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is the story of Newland Archer (Daniel
Day-Lewis), a lawyer in 1870s New York and a member of the privileged
class.  He is engaged to May Welland (Winona Ryder), a pleasant but
oblivious girl from another prominent family.  On the day of their
engagement announcement, Archer is re-introduced to May's cousin Ellen
Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), an unhappily married countess who has left
her European husband for the support of her family in New York.  Ellen
wants a divorce, but the family fears a scandal and entreats Archer to
persuade her to drop the suit.  As Archer becomes Ellen's confidante,
he realizes that she is one of the few people who shares his distaste
for the shallowness of their world.  He falls in love with Ellen, and
finds himself forced to choose between what he most desires and what is
demanded of him by his society.</P>
<P>     THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is a tale of surfaces, of a society concerned
with the appearance of things rather than the reality.  It is a world
where male infidelity is tacitly accepted, provided the man does not
flaunt his indiscretion, a world where a declined dinner invitation is
a social snubbing understood by both parties but never expressly
stated.  Scorsese captures this obsession with surfaces by letting his
camera dwell on things rather than people; calling cards, watch fobs,
earrings and table settings all become icons of status and civility.
Meanwhile, a running narration by Joanne Woodward calls attention to
the coded meanings and ironies in every word and gesture.  It's a
fascinating anthropological study, highlighted by typically bravura
Scorsese moments, including a piercingly insightful tour through one
house during a formal ball.  Yet for all its virtuosity, I found THE
AGE OF INNOCENCE working essentially as a documentary, not the
forbidden love story which is at its core.  Scorsese is so good at
establishing the framework, that he has little time left for the
characters.  They are kept at a distance, which may in part be the
point but left me a bit cold.</P>
<P>     The performers are not to be held responsible for these
shortcomings.  Day-Lewis is quite good as Archer, particularly in a
scene with Pfeiffer where he desperately struggles to find the polite
vocabulary to tell her people will think she's a whore if she gets a
divorce.  He carries himself as though he is constantly on the brink of
exploding but knows that it is impossible to do so.  I had feared that
Pfeiffer would end up repeating her Madame du Tourveil from DANGEROUS
LIAISONS, but she is too canny an actress for that.  She invests Ellen
with as much as the script will allow her, and then some, making her a
sad and slightly embittered woman who knows that being a woman means
never being able to find your own happiness.  Ryder has a thankless
part as May, and seems almost as uncomfortable as she was in BRAM
STOKER'S DRACULA; it appears to be time for her to forego period
drama.  Miriam Margolyes is delightful as May's eccentric and knowing
Granny Mingott, but the rest of the cast is forced to do what it can
with roles which essentially function as Archer's obstacles; they are
not really characters in their own right.</P>
<P>     However, the film's technical credits alone make it required
viewing.  Longtime Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker does a
glorious editing job, and even gets her name on a billboard in the
film.  Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes some stunning and
instantly memorable shots, including an ocean panorama which looks like
a painting.  Elmer Bernstein's score is lush and evocative, and the
costume and production design are certain Oscar nominees.</P>
<P>     THE AGE OF INNOCENCE demonstrates yet again that Martin Scorsese
could direct "Dick and Jane" into a visual spectacle.  It's a
fascinating examination of lifeless and soulless time, and my attention
never waned.  But I kept finding myself oddly detached, wanting to care
more about whether or not Archer and Ellen would find happiness
together but never quite able to do so.  There is so much to admire
about THE AGE OF INNOCENCE that it seems like nitpicking, but I'm funny
that way: I want to be caught up in love stories.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 calling cards: 8.</PRE>
