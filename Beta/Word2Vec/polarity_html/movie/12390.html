<P>     There are plenty of good reasons why I try to write reviews as soon
as possible after seeing a film.  Some are purely practical, like the
deadlines that stack up one against the other as Friday release-date
approaches; some are philosophical, like the desire not to be influenced
by any other opinions I might hear.  QUEST FOR CAMELOT has provided me
with yet another reason, perhaps the best yet -- when you're dealing with
a film as hopelessly bland as this one, you'll be lucky if you can
remember a single detail 48 hours later.</P>
<P>     Thank heaven for press notes, without which I might not recall that
QUEST FOR CAMELOT is the story of Kayley (Jessalyn Gilsig), a
strong-willed young woman in the time of King Arthur.  It seems that a
cruel and ambitious knight named Sir Ruber (Gary Oldman) has stolen
Excalibur from Arthur (Pierce Brosnan), then promptly lost the magical
sword in a dark and dangerous forest.  In an attempt to prove herself
worthy of knighthood and to help save her kidnapped mother (Jane Seymour),
Kayley ventures into the forest alone, where she eventually joins up with
a blind young man named Garrett (Cary Elwes) and a two-headed dragon named
Devon (Eric Idle) and Cornwall (Don Rickles).  Together they must battle
the dangers of the forest, find Excalibur, defeat Ruber, restore order to
the kingdom, blah blah blah.</P>
<P>     And I do mean "blah."  QUEST FOR CAMELOT is one of the most
ennervated animated films in recent memory, a lifeless conglomeration of
elements each more instantly forgettable than the last.  Visually, it
offers uninspired settings and lackluster character design until the
appearance of a nifty computer-generated ogre.  The comic relief isn't
much of a relief at all, serving up a volley of pop culture pot shots
(TAXI DRIVER, DIRTY HARRY, FRIDAY THE 13TH, SUPERMAN), banal bickering
between the dragon's two heads and cringe-inducing voice casting like
Bronson Pinchot and Jaleel White.  Of course we also need to have songs,
which means a truly awful bunch of David Foster/Carol Bayer Sager
compositions alternating between middle-of-the-road piffle and soporific
show-stoppers.  Director Frederik DuChau can't even manage to get his
voice talent to sound vaguely enthusiastic; Brosnan reads the legendary
King of the Britons as though he needs a Prozac far more than he needs
Excalibur.</P>
<P>     QUEST FOR CAMELOT's story seems well-intentioned enough, empowering
its misfit heroes despite the various obstacles to success they face.
Unfortunately, that's about all the story offers.  The film moves with a
deadening listlessness, as DuChau bungles the few genuine bits of action
with bizarre decisions like scoring a tense chase scene to the big love
ballad.  The choice of Elwes as the voice of Kayley's guide through the
forest proves to be a huge mistake, reminding viewers familiar with THE
PRINCESS BRIDE of Westley's infinitely more engaging romantic adventures
through the Fire Swamp with Buttercup.  Eventually, the failure of the
rest of the story makes even the empowerment message annoying, playing
like an anachronistic scolding of the Round Table for including only
fully-abled white male humans.  </P>
<P>     As I vainly searched for something to hold my attention, I kept
noticing the children in the theater wandering up and down the aisles, or
engaged in conversations far more lively than anything on the screen.  I
can't imagine why a parent would subject their children to being bored
silly by a film like QUEST FOR CAMELOT, especially when adults will 
probably be bored even sillier.  Then again, I suppose there would be a
bright side:  two days later, they'll never even remember what they had to
sit through.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Arthur wrecks:  2.</PRE>
