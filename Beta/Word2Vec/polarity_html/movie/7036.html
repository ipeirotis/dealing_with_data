<P>     At first glance, Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino) seems like a dozen movie
mobsters you have seen before, like a dozen movie mobsters Pacino has
played before.  He struts, he poses and he boasts in his first meeting
with jeweler Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp); when Donnie appears ready to end
that meeting, Lefty announces "You don't walk away from Lefty...Lefty
walks away from you."  Don't judge Lefty, or DONNIE BRASCO, by that first
impression, though Lefty himself might have preferred it.  The fact is
that Lefty is a loser:  a thirty year mob veteran still working as a minor
lieutenant in Brooklyn, a compulsive gambler in debt to his own people, a
father with an addict for a son.  In his own mind, however, Lefty is a
winner because he is a wiseguy.  When Lefty takes Donnie under his wing as
a protege, he revels in describing the details of how a wiseguy talks, how
he dresses, how he carries his money and himself.  He fetishizes those
details, because his only sense of self-respect comes from being part of
that world, and he instantly takes to Donnie because Donnie seems to be
the only person who gives him any respect.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately for Lefty, he has picked the wrong protege.  Donnie
Brasco is actually FBI agent Joseph Pistone, working deep undercover to
gather evidence against the mob.  DONNIE BRASCO is based on a memoir by
the real-life Pistone, who spent six years collecting information which
would lead to hundreds of arrests and convictions.  He also spent those
years largely separated from his family and becoming ever more wrapped
up in the world he was supposed to be helping to bring down, and DONNIE
BRASCO spends a fair amount of time on how his work affected his personal
life.  We see his wife Maggie (Anne Heche) coping with raising their three
daughters alone, and arguments over how much Joseph/Donnie's personality
has changed.  As the time nears to draw the net around Donnie's crew, his
superiors in the FBI begin to worry that he has begun to think of his mob
life as his real life.</P>
<P>     As it turns out, the domestic drama in DONNIE BRASCO is actually the
least interesting aspect of the film.  Anne Heche is stuck with the
thankless "long-suffering wife" role, with predictable lines in
predictable scenes; it's hard to imagine anyone giving an interesting spin
to a line like "You're becoming like them."  Depp's performance is solid
and under-stated, a welcome shift from his string of saintly eccentrics.
Unfortunately, Joseph is already immersed in his undercover persona when
we first meet him, making it difficult to understand how much he is
supposed to have changed and why Maggie is still putting up with him.</P>
<P>     The reason those scenes are most frustrating, though, is that Lefty
is so much more fascinating a character than Joseph/Donnie.  Al Pacino has
often been prone to bigger-is-better style of acting, but in DONNIE BRASCO
he harnesses that impulse to turn in his best performance in at least
fifteen years.  There is a wonderful sequence during the second half of
the film in which Lefty and Donnie head down to Miami to investigate an
opportunity running a night club.  Lefty sees the club as his big chance
to strike out and accomplish something on his own, and he sets up a
meeting with Miami's local boss to get the necessary permission.  When the
Miami boss shows up for the meeting, however, he is accompanied by Lefty's
own boss Sonny Black (Michael Madsen), who has decided to take charge of
the enterprise himself.  As we watch Lefty fold in on himself in
disappointment -- compounded by the fact that he believes Donnie has
stabbed him in the back to earn Sonny's favor -- it is impossible not to
feel sympathy for him.  What makes the situation even more pathetic is
that the club is a front for yet another FBI undercover man, making
Lefty's lost dream an illusion from the start.  Pacino's performance is
sweet, crude, funny and haunted, and gives DONNIE BRASCO an unexpected
emotional pull.</P>
<P>     Lefty's hard life is made all the more tragic by the way organized
crime is portrayed.  Under the direction of Mike Newell (FOUR WEDDINGS AND
A FUNERAL), DONNIE BRASCO doesn't crackle with the same energy as films
set in this world made by Scorsese or DePalma, but it is a different
impression of mob life Newell and gifted screenwriter Paul Attanasio (QUIZ
SHOW) are after.  Where other films have made mob life seem terribly
attractive and glamorous, DONNIE BRASCO shows it as petty and tedious.
Sonny Black's crew is always looking for a decent new idea while making do
with hijacking trucks full of razor blades and breaking open sawed-off
parking meters, and their scramble to make the weekly payment to the big
boss makes them just as desperate as salesmen trying to meet a quota.
There is nothing Shakespearean about the power struggles in DONNIE BRASCO.
They are more like inter-office bickering gone haywire, and the rare (but
extremely graphic) moments of violence leave everyone's hands dirty.  The
beauty of Attanasio's script -- and Pacino's performance -- are that they
make Lefty's dedication to his role as lowest man in the lowest crew
something touching.  What begins as the story of a troubled undercover man
is someone else's story by the conclusion:  the story of the Willy Loman
of wiseguys.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 unwiseguys:  8.</PRE>
