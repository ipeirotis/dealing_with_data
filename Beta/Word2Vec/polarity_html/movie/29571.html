<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>This low-budget, inane, cheesy, message sci-fier was of such poor quality that
it was laughable and entertaining in a way goofy films sometimes can be. It's
about invisible aliens coming down from the moon to destroy the Earth unless all
the countries in the world surrender and stop building nuclear weapons. They
send their warning message through pacifist nuclear scientist Adam Penner
(Tonge), because they feel in sympathy with him when he quit his scientist post
with the government's nuclear program after his friend, Dr. Karol Noymann
(Carradine), blew himself up in a lab explosion. The clunky message of the film
(the way the film presents it is clunky), is that all the world's nations should
be working for peace and not getting into the nuclear arms race. It wants to
show that the world's nations can work together in a common cause to defeat an
evil enemy of the world, and if they worked together in peace they could build a
better world or is it a mousetrap! </P>
<P>The invisible invaders get into the corpse of Noymann and have him visit the
startled Penner, who is asked to deliver the message to Washington about their
threat in 24-hours to destroy the world. Penner asks a young colleague, John
Lamont (Hutton), a romantic friend of his secretary daughter, Phyllis (Jean
Byron), to tell them about the threat. Naturally they think Penner has gone
loony. </P>
<P>But the invaders act to offer proof. They kill a pilot and during a hockey game
kill the arena announcer to allow for the pilot's infilitrated corpse to deliver
the threat to those watching the game. Delivering such a warning during a hockey
game took my mind off the puck, but is that the proper world stage to deliver
such a message! Perhaps, only Edward L. Cahn thinks so in order to draw some
laffs. The second warning takes place in LA, as buildings start getting
destroyed. But none of the nations fold their cards. </P>
<P>America realizes this is for real as whole cities start getting destroyed. The
invaders enlist a makeshift army of corpses to do their fighting. This stirs
Penner to volunteer to start building weapons of mass destruction again and help
the world become peaceful by killing its enemy. He's taken to an underground
Atomic Bomb bunker under the protection of square jawed and humorless Major
Bruce Jay (John Agar-one time hubby of Shirley Temple), where he's asked to
figure out a device to make these aliens visible. That's the only way to kill
them, as all other weapons have no effect. Meanwhile the countryside is filled
with corpses of invaders hidden in them and attacking everyone else who isn't
dead or invisible. The invaders have turned the world's own weapons on them in
order to carry out their diabolical plan. I believe they don't have weapons
since they have no pockets to carry them!!! </P>
<P>The major kills without hesitation a crazed farmer who won't get out of the way
of the jeep taking the science team on their way to the bunker to work on saving
the world. This turns Phyllis off, but after the kill he says something sexy to
her and meanwhile John has turned into a sniveling coward. So what's an
attractive girl in the 1950s supposed to do while her dad is only focused on
building his detecting device, but fall for the macho major and give him some
good eye contact. By accident the professor finds out that it's ultrasonic sound
that not only makes the invisible invaders visible but destroys them. </P>
<P>This is a classic in bad sci-fi B-movies. Highly recommended for those who
understand that a film doesn't have to be good to be enjoyable. I liked
it...mainly for its banal dialogue delivered in robotic tones! </P>
