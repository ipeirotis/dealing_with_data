<P>"Tina!!!  Fetch me the axe!!!"  A favourite book of mine called THE
GOLDEN TURKEY AWARDS relates the story that when MOMMIE DEAREST was
unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981, Paramount soon
realised they had a problem on their hands.  It wasn't just the film's
disappointing box office performance.  Indeed, in the coming years
some people would be going back to see it two, three, even six times.
No, the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of
screen queen Joan Crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the
year.</P>
<P>In a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of
events, some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print
advertisements screaming: "Mommie Dearest: The Biggest Mommie Of Them
All!".  Executives at Paramount were appalled and soon had the ads
withdrawn, but it was all too late.  MOMMIE DEAREST was already
cementing its place in camp cinema history.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Faye Dunaway's energetic, at times ridiculously
over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature.
Based on daughter Christina Crawford's trashy biography, MOMMIE
DEAREST chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of
her moviestar mother.  If you believe this movie, it was a life was
racked by obsession, lonliness, child abuse and rampant egomania.</P>
<P>The film begins with Crawford adopting two children, and concludes in
the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find
out they have been left out of their mother's will.  Joan always
wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves, you see.  But
that's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive
to the film's end.  The script - laboured over by four writers, a bad
sign in itself  - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds
little dramatic momentum.  Frank Perry's direction is no more than
competent, and Dunaway's bitchy lines aside, the dialogue is flat and
uninvolving.</P>
<P>In fairness, the film's second half ditches some of the cartoon
hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters.  When
the adult Christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling,
Joan visits and keeps in touch, not helping her financially but
encouraging Christina's own acting and career ambitions.  Crawford
does seem to care about her daughter, but you can sense the emotional
distance and feel some of their pain.  You also get glimpses of what
the film could have been in the hands of better writers.</P>
<P>Ah, but there IS Dunaway's performance.  And what a delicious piece of
campery it often is.  Having just been sacked by her studio after a
run of box office duds, Crawford storms home late at night and
proceeds to go ballistic in the garden.  She has the maid drag the
kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she's making.
Spotting a young tree she doesn't like the look of, she turns to the
trembling Christina and utters the immortal line "Tina!!  Fetch me the
axe!!" with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor
sapling.</P>
<P>In the film's most outrageous scene, Joan realises that some of her
daughter's clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers.  Oh dear!  Sounds
like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum, doesn't it?   This
time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering
another classic outburst: "No...wire...hangers....EVER!!!!".  And
later, when the Board of her late husband's company Pepsi Cola tries
to divest her of her directorship, she displays a superb grasp of
business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring: "Don't fuck
with me, fellas!!".  Oh joy!</P>
<P>Something of a camp classic, then, but if that's not you're cup of tea
then MOMMIE DEAREST doesn't have too much to recommend it.  Better you
see the real Crawford in THE WOMEN (1939), MILDRED PIERCE (1945) or
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE (1962).  Great films distinguished by
great performances, and a far more eloquent testament to this great
woman than Frank Perry's shrieking piece of tabloid froth.</P>
