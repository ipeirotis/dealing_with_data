<P>     One has to wonder why the film makers bothered to make a sequel to 
1994's THE CROW.  Although it made money, that movie, which brought the 
world of James O'Barr's comic book to life, was not a huge box office 
success, and a fair number of its viewers were probably  lured into 
theaters by macabre curiosity.  It is, after all, the film Brandon Lee 
had been working on at the time of his tragic death.  As a result, the 
release of THE CROW was swathed in the kind of lurid sensationalism that 
inevitably fattens up a gross.  There is no such behind-the-scenes story 
to increase audiences for the second installment, and the result is 
likely to be a short theatrical life.</P>
<P>     Actually, THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS is little more than a subpar 
remake of the first outing, with a less-charismatic actor in the lead 
role (European hunk Vincent Perez takes over for Lee).  The story goes 
something like this:  an evil drug lord (Richard Brooks) orders Ashe 
Corven (Perez) and his young son killed after they are discovered  in 
the wrong place at the wrong time.  Aided by an animatronic crow, Ashe 
comes back to life to gain his revenge on his killers.  His path crosses 
that of Sarah (Mia Kirshner), a refugee from the first film, and she 
becomes a pawn in the drug lord's schemes to destroy Ashe, whose only 
source of vulnerability is the black bird that flies above him and 
provides his powers.  </P>
<P>     Everyone in the cast, from Perez down, plays their role as if they 
are stoned.  Despite looking like an outcast from the band KISS, Perez 
never musters much energy.  Mia Kirshner, last seen stripping in 
EXOTICA, gives a flat, uninteresting performance, and Richard Brooks' 
sadistic Judah is more likely to inspire apathy than hatred.  Villains 
need to be charismatic; Brooks is just plain dull.  Iggy Pop, who goes 
over-the-top as Judah's sidekick, is much more entertaining.</P>
<P>     The start-to-finish violence and throbbing rock soundtrack are 
evidence that the film makers recognized the story's inadequacies and 
attempted to compensate on a purely visceral level.  Like the first 
CROW, this is a new wave DEATH WISH, but that film at least had the 
distinction of being original in approach, if not content.  This one is 
a rehash, and director Tim Pope doesn't display nearly the same skill 
that Alex Proyas brought to the earlier feature.  </P>
<P>     THE CROW takes place in Detroit; CITY OF ANGELS transpires in a 
stylized, gothic Los Angeles that looks almost identical to the one John 
Carpenter recently captured in ESCAPE FROM L.A.  This is a nightmarish 
view of the city's future -- a cheerless place more fit for inhabitation 
by the dead than the living.  Speaking about L.A., Sarah says, "They 
call this the City of Angels, but all I see are victims."  Really, 
though, when it comes to THE CROW 2, the victims aren't the poor souls 
suffering on-screen -- they're the men and women who paid money to gain 
admittance to the theater.  THE CROW, unlike the main character, should 
have stayed dead and buried after its first go-'round.</P>
