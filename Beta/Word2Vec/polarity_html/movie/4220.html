<PRE>                               FEAST OF JULY
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     FEAST OF JULY is a movie based on an H. E. Bates novel.  For those
of us who have read his books or seen any of the wonderful Masterpiece
Theater adaptations on TV ("Love for Lydia", "Country Matters", etc.),
we know right away that something special is about occur when we see
Bates name.  He is a master storyteller with a gift for getting deep
into the inner spirit of people.  His stories are usually tragedies
where the protagonists strive gallantly in elusive quests for
happiness.  His stories are quiet ones with much depth and heavy
characterizations.  They tear at your heart.</P>
<P>     The movie FEAST OF JULY ranks among the best of the Bates movies
and mini-series.  First time movie director Christopher Menaul (who did
the great "Prime Suspect I" on TV) does a brilliant job of moving Bates
to the big screen without removing any of the small aspects that makes
Bates's works so special.  It would have been a temptation to try to
jazz up the script with more dialog or to direct the actors to be more
lively, but he showed great control and confidence in his material.  He
knew that he had a strong cast, and he could rely on the story and on
facial expressions and body language to tell much of the tale.  Bates
teaches us all about the human spirit, and Menaul trusted his audience
not to get bored, but to pay attention and get wrapped up in an
entrancing story.</P>
<P>     As the movie opens, it is the late 1800s, and Bella Ford (Embeth
Davidtz) is pregnant and is in a personal forced march across a bleak
English countryside in bad weather.  She stops in a hut where blood
starts pouring out from under where she has fallen exhausted.  She is
having an extremely realistic miscarriage.  From the first scene our
hearts go out for her.  With a single image the director and some great
acting have already captured our heart.  I rarely want to cry three
minutes into a show as I did then.</P>
<P>     Bella comes to a town looking for Arch Wilson (Greg Wise) who told
her he was going to marry her but vanished getting her pregnant.  He is
not to be found, but the father, Ben (Tom Bell), of the Wainwright
family takes pity on her and takes her in their home to live for a
while.  The mother (Gemma Jones) gives Bella her daughter's clothes
since the daughter died of a fever three years ago.  The sons, Jedd
(James Purefoy), Con (Ben Chaplin), and Matty (Kenneth Anderson), are
all in their 20s like Bella.  They think she is pretty, and slowly
there develops a rivalry among them for her attention.  This rivalry
plus Bella's continuing search for Arch Wilson is the heart of the
tale.  Although it was a novel, it feels like a short story since it
has such simplicity and yet great intensity.</P>
<P>     Even the little parts of the story are special.  Matty is a shoe
maker and thinks he is one of the best in England.  He brags to Bella
that he once made the smallest shoes ever made in England.  They were
for a midget who performed on stage.  His plight is that, with the
industrial revolution, shoes are made by machines faster and cheaper
than he can craft them by hand.  He feels that he must leave his little
village and move to London since only there will they be able to afford
custom made shoes.  He is melancholy and yet resigned to his fate as he
explains it to Bella.</P>
<P>     The sets appear to be extremely accurate recreations of the
period.  Quite compelling.  The cinematography by Peter Sova is
incredible.  Where do I begin with so many examples?  Let me cite just
two.  In the fog scenes, the characters move through the fog like sad
black ghosts as only their outline shows.  In the scene of the lighting
of the gas lamps on the street at night and of the dinners lit only by
oil lamps, the pictures are realistically dark and yet possess a warm
glow as if it is a metaphor of the attempt for inner peace of all of
the characters.</P>
<P>     All of the actors and actresses delivery terrific performances.
It is hard to single out any since it is an ensemble piece of acting.
I guess Embeth Davidtz is my favorite, but all were so good.  With only
a few lines, Gemma Jones steals most of the scenes she is in.  You may
remember her as the Duchess in "The Duchess of Duke Street."</P>
<P>     The dialog as written by Bates and as carefully and lovingly
adapted for the screen by Christopher Neame, is sparse and yet
carefully constructed for maximum effect.  Each of the characters is
special in some way.  Con, for example, is somewhat of a simpleton who
loves penguins.  He is extremely gentle with them and feeds them daily.
In the human world, he is awkward.  He can not dance and has trouble
controlling his emotions.  Finally, the ending of the movie is
excellent and left me gripping the chair as the credits started to
roll.</P>
<P>     FEAST OF JULY runs 1:58 and never drags.  It is rated R for sex
and violence.  It would be excellent for teenagers of all ages to see
it.  I highly recommend this heart wrenching tragedy to you, and I give
it *** 1/2.  With a little stronger middle, it could have gotten my top
rating.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
