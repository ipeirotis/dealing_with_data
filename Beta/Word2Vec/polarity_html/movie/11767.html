                                BREAKDOWN (R)
                    A Film Review by FERNANDO Vallejo
 _________________________________________________________</PRE>
<PRE> RATING (OUT OF ****): ***1/2</PRE>
<P>  Imagine this  scenario: you and any of your family members are scudding
through one of those long, excruciating cross-country car trips, far from the
city and into the deserted rural routes. So far, the trip is idyllic when,
abruptly, your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere.
It is not an easy situation, but a perfectly plausible one, the panorama in
which BREAKDOWN musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed
tautness. It is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays,
but  BREAKDOWN doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it
derives a masterful, titillating climax that by it's finale, engrosses a
viewer with total absorption. </P>
<P>   The plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's THE VANISHING. Kurt Russell and
Kathleen Quinlan respectively play Jeff and Amy Taylor, a Massachusetts couple
en route to California for a brand new job. When they stop for gas somewhere
in the arid Southwest, Jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver, who later,
will be an important player in the plot department. Minutes later after that,
their brand new, strikingly red, Jeep Grand Cherokee unexpectedly stops. Jeff
cannot detect the car's problem, so he allows Amy to take a ride with Red (J.
T Walsh), a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town,
where Jeff will meet her at a local diner. It is facile for the film to turn
into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor.</P>
<P>   Jeff manages to re-start the car himself, but when he arrives at the diner,
she is nowhere in sight. Disconcerted, the coffee shop's bartender informs
Jeff where to search for his wife, a town about twenty miles from here. There,
trouble arises. And I shall not reveal anything else, since that would be
spoiling the fun of what's head.</P>
<P>   There are many involving, tight scenes in BREAKDOWN but the final climactic
period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck,
will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam. It is a
pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good Vs evil, and rooting
for the good guys, in this case Jeff. </P>
<P> Kurt Russell is one of the few top-notch Hollywood actors which doesn't
overblow his acting, and gradually gains reliance on his role as it
progresses. So you can assume his alteration in BREAKDOWN is letter-perfect.
Suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation, from a jolly man, to a guy
frantically pursuing a loved one. Not many well-paid actors can deliver these
type of performances, but Russell is one of them. As an everyday man , he
pulls it off extremely convincingly, what also surprised me more was his
rigorous physicality, which he effectively practices almost all throughout the
films 93 minutes. </P>
<P>  Although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences
(very well done) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances
this man is presented with. Faced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts,
the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable
characters, including the cryptic villains, who in essence, make the movie
what it is.</P>
<P>  What's most  impressive however, is the feature debut by writer/director
Jonathan Mostow. Mostow, hitherto directed the Showtime thriller FLIGHT OF A
BLACK ANGLE, alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by
gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot, efficiently letting the tone and
the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well-
made affair. Contrary to most American thrillers, he doesn't rely on visual
flair, but on aesthetics and substance. After BREAKDOWN,  he should gain vast
notoriety. </P>
<P>   The villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world
idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective. The
baddies in BREAKDOWN, all well acted,  are normal, seemingly inoffensive
townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer, conduct an amoral business of
corruption and murder. The movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome
rednecks, and, of all things in the world, it is becoming rather easy to root
for villains (Jon Voight in ANACONDA) in today's movies. Worth a special
mentioning is J.T Walsh (who previously worked with Kurt Russell in EXECUTIVE
DECISION ) as the leader of the gang, he renders a deliciously wicked
performance, temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for. </P>
<P>   Alfred Hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate, but as
a way of aiding his audience's fascination in his stories, which were slowly
realizing man's biggest fears. BREAKDOWN yields exactly that. It magnificently
taps into the psyche of an ordinary man,acting like an ordinary man, looking
like an ordinary and some sort of superhero. Despite one or two iffy moments
even Hitchcock, I think, would approve of  BREAKDOWN. (1:33)</P>
