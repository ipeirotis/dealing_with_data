<P>A minor but most enjoyable tongue-in-cheek Hitchcockian-like spy
thriller from the Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger team. Conrad Veidt
is Danish Captain Anderson of the merchant ship Helvig, where he is
stopped on British waters for a contraband check in 1939 and taken to a
control port, where he will have to wait until morning before the boat
is cleared. He soon discovers that his landing passes giving to him by
the British have been stolen by two passengers, Mrs Sorensen (Valerie
Hobson) and Mr Pidgeon (Esmond Knight), which prompts Anderson to row
ashore in pursuit of them; it will turn out that both are agents for
British Naval Intelligence. He locates them on a train bound for London,
but loses him and desperately clings on to her (a wise choice, she is
very attractive). In the middle of the blackout a vender is hawking gas
masks and torches, and the wartime atmosphere is cleverly made use of,
as he courts the divorced Mrs. Sorenson despite the imminent dangers
surrounding her. He takes her to dine in the Danish restaurant of the
brother of his first-mate, Axel Skold (Hay Petrie), and is given the
royal treatment by the owner, Erik Skold (Hay Petrie).  Soon the two are
captured by German spies and taken for interrogation to an old nemesis
of hers, Van Dyne (Raymond Lovell), who discovers she has info about
neutral ships helping the Germans, which are hidden on cigarette paper.</P>
<P>When Anderson escapes being tied up, he leaves her behind to make it
look like they are both there, and he goes back to the same restaurant
and recruits the help of the staff to rescue her and capture the spies.
Mrs Sorensen then gives the real message she is carrying to her
superiors and the merchant ship sails on time to Denmark with everyone
on board.</P>
<P>The brisk pace of the film and its touches of quaintness, made the film
seem very comically endearing inspite of the lack of any character study
and the one-dimensional tone of the villains. The likable lovers, also,
starred in Powell's The Spy in Black... It was strange to see Veidt in a
romantic hero role, and even though he is such a fine actor, I prefer
him in villain roles and wonder how much better a more romantically
inclined hero would have fared in that role.</P>
<P>My favorite line in the film is when Veidt tells Hobson why he is still
not in the Danish navy: "The smaller the ship, the bigger the
adventure."</P>
