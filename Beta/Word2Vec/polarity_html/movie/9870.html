<P>     Here's a brain teaser for all you aspiring screenwriters out there:
how do you adapt MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, a 350-page
true-crime drama in which the crime doesn't occur until around page 170?
Before you answer, I should warn you that it's a bit of a trick question.
John Berendt's 1994 non-fiction novel, based on the author's experiences
while living in Savannah, Georgia in the 1980s, defies simple
categorization.  Part travelogue, part character study, part cultural
anthropology lesson and part courtroom thriller, it combined disparate
elements into the hypnotic tale of a unique place.  So that screenwriting
assignment might be better phrased as:  how do you adapt MIDNIGHT IN THE
GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL, a 350-page true-crime drama which isn't really a
true-crime drama?</P>
<P>     John Lee Hancock had more or less the right idea when he chose to let
his screenplay wander and sprawl.  The backbone of the narrative involves
Berendt's fictional stand-in, a New York writer named John Kelso (John
Cusack) who comes to Savannah on assignment for Town & Country Magazine to
cover the city's most lavish Christmas party.  The host of that party is
Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey), a wealthy antiques dealer who instantly
charms Kelso with his wit, hospitality and fondness for Kelso's writing.
Then Kelso finds his assignment taking an unexpected grim twist when
Williams is charged with first-degree murder in the death of his assistant
-- and lover -- Billy Hanson (Jude Law).</P>
<P>     That covers the "plot" in a video-guide-summary sense, but it doesn't
begin to do justice to what MIDNIGHT is about.  Hancock's script wisely
retains Berendt's willingness to let a collection of colorful characters
carry the story in tangential directions, painting a messy but vivid
portrait of Savannah as (in Kelso's words) "GONE WITH THE WIND on
mescaline."  Among Kelso's odd encounters are run-ins with a voodoo
priestess named Minerva (Irma P. Hall) and a flirtatious relationship with
pre-operative transsexual The Lady Chablis (played by the real Lady
herself).  Director Clint Eastwood chooses an ideal, languid pace for
MIDNIGHT which turns it into the perfect Southern story:  in no particular
hurry to get anywhere, yet still intriguing in its richness of detail.</P>
<P>     In Berendt's novel, that fragmented approach turns the city of
Savannah itself into the story's principal character.  The Williams trial
functions primarily as a lightning rod for the attitudes and perceptions
of the city's inhabitants, in whom eccentricity is ultimately a matter of
degree.  There are, however, some vacuums Hollywood abhors, and MIDNIGHT
IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL tries to fill two of them with some pretty
ineffective stuff.  Instead of a story about a strange and mysterious
place, it is transformed into the story of a confidence-impaired writer on
a quest for True Love and Acceptance; instead of reveling in atmospheric
unpredictability, the script introduces a romantic interest (Alison
Eastwood) so token you could use her to ride the subway.  Hancock works
wonders with the novel's decade-long time frame, condensing events with
impressive economy.  He also strains to shove the story's square pegs into
the gaping round hole of studio picture paradigms.</P>
<P>     Hancock and Eastwood may very well have made the best adaptation of
MIDNIGHT possible within a studio system.  The acting is first-rate from
top to bottom (including a sly and charismatic debut by The Lady Chablis
as him/herself), Eastwood's technical team delivers typical excellence,
and many of the book's best situations are re-created with sharp humor.
There's just something vaguely unsatisfying about MIDNIGHT, and not just
in comparison to its source material.  This story cries out for a less
conventional treatment, though it's still fairly unconventional by most
standards.  The makers of MIDNIGHT had their heart in the right place, but
the result teases with the promise of an off-beat exploration it delivers
only sporadically.  Perhaps the answer to that screenwriting assignment is
even trickier than the question.  How do you adapt MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN
OF GOOD AND EVIL?  You don't.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 midnight not-so-specials:  6.</PRE>
