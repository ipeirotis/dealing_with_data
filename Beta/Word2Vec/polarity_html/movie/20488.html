Reviewed September 11, 1999.</P>
<P>It's terribly unfortunate that "Stir of Echoes," tautly written and directed 
by David Koepp (who made one of 1996's unsung treasures, "The Trigger 
Effect"), should be released little more than a month after "The Sixth 
Sense," which is still going strong at the box office. These two films are 
undoubtedly going to be compared (judging from practically all of my fellow 
audience members last night), and although they have eerily similar 
storylines, "Stir of Echoes" is more of a straightforward psychological 
horror film, while "The Sixth Sense" is closer to a psychological drama. 
Additionally, while "The Sixth Sense" had a shocker of an ending that 
undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business, 
"Stir of Echoes" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist. And 
where "The Sixth Sense" was disturbing, "Stir of Echoes" is just plain scary. 
I have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of 
the unavoidable similarities, and will foolishly forget to judge this film on 
its own respectable merits.</P>
<P>Adapted from a novel by Richard Matheson that was written some forty years 
ago, "Stir of Echoes" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named Jake (Zachary 
David Cope) who is taking a bath. He is speaking directly at the screen, but 
we immediately have a feeling someone else is there. Finally, he asks, "Does 
it hurt to be dead?" Apparently Jake sees the ghosts of dead people, but 
unlike "The Sixth Sense," this young child isn't the focus of the picture. 
Instead, Tom Witzy (Kevin Bacon), a Chicago lineman, is our protagonist. Jake 
is his son, and Maggie (Kathryn Erbe), whom has just discovered she is six 
weeks pregnant, is his hard-working wife. One night while at a party with 
their closest friends, Tom convinces Maggie's New-Age sister, Lisa (Illena 
Douglas), to try and hypnotize him. It unexpectedly works, and before long, 
Tom is seeing things he wouldn't normally see, including a deceased teenage 
girl (Jenny Morrison) in his house who happens to have been missing for the 
last six months. Seeking help from Lisa, she tells him that, while he was 
under hypnosis, she told him that after he awoke, his mind will remain clear 
and free, like an opened door. She didn't expect it to work, but it did, and 
the only way to stop it is for Tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he 
sees.</P>
<P>"Stir of Echoes" isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination, but 
in the thick, atmospheric mood it conjures up, it is a terrifically eerie 
domestic horror-drama, and is not only effective on a technical level, but is 
impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family. Kevin Bacon 
and, especially, Kathryn Erbe (1997's "Dream With the Fishes"), are top-notch 
and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have 
their fair share of problems. After Tom is hypnotized and starts seeing 
ghastly visions, he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this 
mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house, and 
instead of Maggie not being understanding, she instead believes what Tom 
says, and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through, does 
not try to stop his pursuit. Bacon and Erbe are not traditional Hollywood 
stars like Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts, and therefore, are easier to relate 
to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at 
their jobs just to make ends meet.</P>
<P>In a masterfully-done, entrancing sequence, Tom is hypnotized by Lisa, but 
instead of watching him, we instead see what he sees, starting from his view 
as he closes his eyes into darkness. Lisa tells him to visualize being in an 
empty movie theater, and so, we, as audience members, are watching a movie 
screen from inside a theater, which is also showing a movie screen in a 
theater. Telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word 
in black letters pops up on the screen, we begin to float closer and closer 
to the front of the theater until we see that the word is "sleep." Never 
before have I seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed 
as this one. Truthfully, this set-piece, and another in which Tom wakes up 
from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has 
just dreamt, are worth the full price of admission alone, just to see them on 
the big screen.</P>
<P>Having loads of fun with her small role as Maggie's sister, Lisa, Illeana 
Douglas (1995's "To Die For," her last great character) is a delight, but 
rarely used to her full advantage in feature films. Funny and enjoyably 
offbeat, Douglas gets to utter the best line in the film: While talking to 
Maggie about Tom's visions of the girl, she remarks, "I wouldn't be worried 
about him seeing another girl, although the fact that she's dead gives one 
pause." Also of note are Jenny Morrison (1994's "Intersection"), who is truly 
poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really 
happened to her missing character, and Liza Weil, remarkable in 1998's 
"Whatever," as Morrison's grieving teenage sister, Debbie.</P>
<P>If the resolution of "Stir of Echoes" does not live up to its obviously 
frightful full potential (and it doesn't), what comes before is both 
involving and appropriately gritty. The music score, by James Newton Howard, 
and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects, successfully 
compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that Tom is put into, 
and director David Koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack 
for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around 
realistically-written characters. "Stir of Echoes" isn't as good as "The 
Sixth Sense," but why should it need to be? Both films are fully capable of 
standing on their own two feet, and "Stir of Echoes" really is a 
spinetinglingly good horror film.</P>
