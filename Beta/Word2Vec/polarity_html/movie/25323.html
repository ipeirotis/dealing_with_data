<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Based on a minor novella by W. Somerset Maugham, this bourgeois story is
about some British and American expatriates living in Florence, Italy,
in 1938, right before World War II started. The main focus is on a young
British widow in her thirties, who lives in a fantastic villa. It is
stiffly directed by Philip Haas (Angels and Insects/The Music of
Chance), whose wife Belinda wrote the screenplay and was the film's
editor.</P>
<P>The film is mainly about how the prim English widow comes to grips with
what love means to her. But, she is painted into such a silly corner in
the romance, that the film never had a chance to do anything but pant
heavily for close to two hours.</P>
<P>These expatriates, seekers of the good life, find themselves peeved at
Fascism, that it has become a mild inconvenience to their lifestyles,
which hardly makes one sympathetic to their plight when Fascism is right
on their gold-plated doorsteps and the party leader, Beppino Leopardi
(Ghini), is invited to their elite parties.</P>
<P>Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) has been struck a severe blow in life
because of a failed first-marriage, where she married for love and then
watched as her husband became a drunk, a wife-beater and squandered her
inheritance. She is now forced to accept favors from her society
friends, the idle rich sycophants who are lolling around at cocktail
parties and at tennis courts. She has the social connections, but is
short on the bread, which makes her feel very uncomfortable.</P>
<P>In the next few days, Mary will have to make a big decision, as the much
older Sir Edgar Swift (James Fox) asks her to marry him and will return
from Rome in two days to hear her answer. He is a longtime acquaintance,
knowing her ever since she was a child, but he is someone she is not in
love with. He is a wealthy, proper gentleman, who could offer her a
secure and comfortable life, something that she is very tempted by. Her
mentor and benefactor, the snobbish Princess San Ferdinando (Anne
Bancroft), offers her advice: Forget love and marry for money.</P>
<P>At Anne Bancroft's gathering for her society friends, the nattily
dressed Rowley Flint (Sean Penn), an American with a terrible reputation
as a shopgirl womanizer and someone of amoral character, is seated next
to Mary and asked by Anne Bancroft to drive her home, as Florence is
starting to become a dangerous place at night because of the vagrants.</P>
<P>On the drive home, Flint makes a pass at Mary, tries talking her out of
marrying Sir Edgar, and gets slapped as he puts a move on her. She takes
the car and hightails it out of there. But on the darkened road, she
nearly runs over the depressed Austrian violin player (Jeremy Davies),
who played at the restaurant party she was at that evening, where
despite his terrible violin playing, she gave him a big tip. Feeling
sorry for the nervous and disheveled bloke, she takes him back to her
estate to show him the paintings on the wall, feed him, and give him the
best screw he ever got in his life. This is a token of her patrician
generosity, as she figures, this guy's a refugee running away from the
Nazis, I might as well give him something wonderful to remember for the
rest of his life, so if he goes back to the concentration camp he, at
least, will have some pleasant memories. The problem with this
melodramatic scene, was that the acting was shrill and the outcome was
hardly convincing.</P>
<P>The next night the violin player who was supposed to leave Florence,
instead, decides to stay and have another romp with Mary. But she tells
him no dice. Unfortunately,
the violin player has a death wish and grabs the gun Sir Edgar gave her
for protection and shoots himself in her bedroom. This is a very
inconvenient place for him to die, so she enlists the help of Flint to
dispose of his body and cover their trail. She mentions to Flint that
she slept with the violin player because "My heart was full of
tenderness and pity."</P>
<P>To inject some comedy into this dull film, Derek Jacobi has a small part
as a drag queen, offering Mary his support. While Anne Bancroft
shamelessly culls laughs for her performance as a gossip-mongering
high-class slut, who has a contemptable attitude toward people. Both
performers chew the scenery.</P>
<P>I found this stiff upper lip film to be ridiculous; the acting and
directing robotic. The film lacked tension, it was not erotic, and the
story went out of its way not to make sense. That Mary has to choose
between marrying the next governor of Bengal, in India, someone who will
never desert her, Sir Edgar, or Flint, a playboy who will most likely
grow tired of her and discard her for another, hardly seemed to matter.
They all seemed to deserve each other. The only thing about this movie
that pleased me, was how it couldn't ruin the splendor of the beautiful
Florence countryside and its splendidly graceful edifices, as Florence
is lushly photographed in all its magnificence.</P>
