<PRE>                                 SUBURBIA
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     "What are you doing now?" asks spaced out Buff (Steve Zahn) as he
hangs out one night outside the laundromat.  "I don't know," replies
his equally dazed friend Bee-Bee (Dina Spybey).  "You mean like now?
Like right now?  Waiting."</P>
<P>     The recent high school graduates in Burnfield are not having a
good time. Director Richard Linklater's marvelous picture BEFORE
SUNRISE (1995) was on my best of the year list in 1995.  Like it, his
new film SUBURBIA chronicles one night in the lives of its young
characters.</P>
<P>     Most of the film takes place outside the Circle A convenience
store where the young people in the story hang out to cuss and to get
drunk with their friends.  One of their sports is to taunt the young
man, Nazeer (Ajay Naidu), who owns the store since he is a Pakistani.
Tim (Nicky Katt) is the chief trouble maker and hurls racial epithets
at Nazeer for coming to this country.  Everyone in the show, including
Nazeer, is about twenty-years old.  Nazeer has worked his way up and
has two years left before his gets his engineering degree.  He tries in
vain to tell the other young people how they are wasting their lives.</P>
<P>     One woman with multicolor, porcupine hair, Sooze (Amie Carey), is
a painter and a performance artist.  She displays her "talent" to the
group.  She sings and tap dances a foul mouthed routine full of
adolescent angst, which she calls the "Burger Manifesto, Part I."  She
says it is about racism, sexism and environmentalism.  Her friend
claims that Sooze has never known any black people.  Racking her brain,
Sooze is finally able to think one.</P>
<P>     The philosopher of the group is Jeff (Giovanni Ribisi).  He claims
empathy for the oppressed, but Sooze laughs this off with, "you've
taken one night course about Nicaragua at a community college."</P>
<P>     In a show that has no narrative drive, the main event of the
evening occurs when their high school buddy Pony (Jayce Bartok) comes
back in his limo.  He had a hit record a year ago, and now he is a rock
star.  He brings along his mentor, Erica (Parker Posey).  Pony and
Erica hang out with the rest of the crew.  Pony agrees to sing his
latest song.  Prophetically, it starts, "I sound like an idiot."  Most
of the old gang resents Pony's success.  "I don't need a limousine to
know who I am," says Jeff.  "At least I know I don't know."</P>
<P>     The script of SUBURBIA by Eric Bogosian (TALK RADIO) is based on
his 1994 play of the same name.  Much of the dialog rings true, and yet
the characters he creates are not ones you would want to spend ten
minutes with, much less two hours.  Only Nazeer is a sympathetic
character.  Most of the characters Bogosian concocts are cliches.
Jeff, for example, makes a wide variety of crude sexual gestures and
lies about his sexual escapades to his buddies.</P>
<P>     Since the characters are close to parody, the story might have
been better if it had abandoned its pseudo-realism.  On the other hand,
many of the characters are so pathetic, the show could have been recast
into a tragedy.  As presented, it is a comedy that is sometimes funny
and sometimes insightful, but mainly tedious.</P>
<P>     Even if the acting is mediocre, the quality of the directing by
Richard Linklater comes through.  I think he did as much as he could to
make the story come alive.</P>
<P>     After the show meanders for about two hours, Bogosian throws in
its only creative tension with an ending out of left field.  The ending
is manipulative, but at least it signaled that my time with these
people was finally over.  I wish Nazeer well in his career as an
engineer.  He tells us that he is planning on leaving Burnfield when he
graduates.  Don't change your mind Nazeer.</P>
<P>     SUBURBIA runs way too long at 2:00.  It is rated R for alcohol
abuse by underage drinkers, sexual references, strong language, and
brief male frontal nudity.  Teenagers will probably like the show and
they and people in their twenties are probably the intended audience.
Still, I do not think the film is acceptable for teens unless they are
quite mature.  Although I had several good laughs, more often I was
bored so I give the film thumbs down and **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
