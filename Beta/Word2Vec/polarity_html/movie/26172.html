<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>I enjoyed this film much better than when I first saw it in a theater
many years ago, as I watched this B/W noir thriller recently on TMC and
got a better feel for this fugitive on-the-run film, one that spawned a
new genre. The film is based on Davis Goodis' novel about Vincent Parry
(Bogart) an innocent man convicted of murdering his wife, who escapes
from his life sentence in San Quentin, has plastic surgery only on his
face, and tries to clear his name while being aided by an attractive,
wealthy young woman, Irene Jansen (Bacall), whose father was just
executed in San Quentin, after being framed for her stepmother's murder.
Delmar Daves, the writer/director, has done a more than credible job in
catching the tense atmosphere involving the characters and the San
Francisco locale. The film is almost stolen by bizarre performances by
both Agnes Moorhead as the nosey Madge, and by Clifton Young as Baker,
the small-time hood with the crooked smile and the even more crooked
heart.</P>
<P>Parry is never seen, as we only hear his voice for about an hour into
the film, seeing a picture of him only in the newspaper as an escapee,
as he tells his tale from his subjective viewpoint. This method of
filming, puts us in the convict's shoes, as from his angle of vision we
first see him as a shadowy figure escaping from prison, rolling down a
hill and heading for San Francisco. The hard-lucked Parry hitches a ride
with the much too inquisitive Baker. When it is evident that he is
recognized by the man, Parry punches him out, whereby he is quickly
given a lift by the artist Irene, who just happens by. He is surprised
that she knows all about him and is offering to help him escape, but as
reluctant as he is to get her involved in his plight, he needs her help,
as there is a police roadblock and he must get back to San Francisco to
figure out who framed him and why.</P>
<P>She takes him back to her swell pad, buys him new fancy clothes, gives
him a thousand dollars, but while she is out shopping, Parry is
listening to some swing music, and Irene's friend, the one who
coincidentally gave the false testimony that convicted Parry at the
trial, Madge, rings the doorbell, and leaves after Parry in a muffled
voice tells her to beat it. Parry is convinced she will return and
decides to flee the country.</P>
<P>Inside Sam's (D' Andrea) taxi, Parry is told that he looks like he's in
trouble but has an innocent face. The cabbie says that he's an expert at
determining if a person is good or evil by just looking at the person.
He decides to help by taking Parry to a plastic surgeon (Stevenson), who
performs a 90 minute operation on him, telling him that he made him look
older and unrecognizable from his old appearance, but that he must keep
the bandages on for a few days. Parry only has one close friend that he
trusts, a good-hearted soul, George (Rory), who doesn't bother anyone,
just plays the trumpet and whose only ambition is to go someday to Peru.
When Parry returns from the surgery, he goes to his friend's apartment
hoping that he can take care of him till he heals, but he finds George
bludgeoned to death on the floor and realizes he is being framed again.
As he rushes out of the apartment, he sees Baker's car parked in front
of the house. When he reaches Irene's house, the only other person he
feels he can turn to for help, he collapses in her hallway, where she
revives him as he tells her why he is here again. The next morning she
shows him the newspaper story, which accuses him of killing his friend.</P>
<P>Madge comes over, with Parry hiding in the bedroom, as she tells Irene
she is scared that Parry will kill her and wants to stay there. Also in
the apartment is Bob (Bennett), who has a Platonic relationship with
Irene, but was a former boyfriend of Madge's. Eventually Irene gets Bob
to take Madge home. Before the dawn comes up, Parry takes off his
bandages, and it turns out that he looks just like Humphrey Bogart.</P>
<P>He once again leaves Irene's place, planning to leave the country. The
hard-luck fugitive, even with a different face, still gets stopped by a
cop while in a diner
and has to make a daring escape from him. But he is soon picked up in
his hotel room by the wormy Baker, who was following him all this time.
He holds a gun on him, and tells him that he wants Irene to give him
$60,000 to keep quiet or else he'll tell the police and collect a $5,000
reward.</P>
<P>Once in the car heading toward Irene's, Parry out tricks Baker and gets
the jump on him. While questioning him, he learns that it was Madge who
tailed him to George's and Irene's place, and figures out that she is
the one who murdered both George and his wife. When Baker makes a lunge
to take away the gun from Parry, he stumbles off the cliff and dies from
the fall.</P>
<P>Parry then goes to Madge's place and confronts her, gets her to confess,
but she will not sign the confession, as she tells him no one will
believe him. When they tussle in front of her window, she falls fatally
to the street. Afraid that no one but Irene will believe he is innocent,
he flees to Peru, where he will rendezvous with her, as the last shot
shows them happily dancing in a beautiful oceanfront nightclub.</P>
<P>The use of the first person point-of-view camera through the film's
first thirty minutes, was interesting and actually better done than the
use of such a similar camera gimmick in "Lady in the Lake," which did it
an year earlier. What makes this noir slightly different than others, is
that Bogart's troubles are from external matters, not from his own
character flaws, like in most noir film. His problem is that he got into
a situation where it is not likely the law Establishment will believe
him. The fatalism commonly developed in the internal structures of most
noir protagonists, is just not relevant to the Bogart character, who
ends up in a happy relationship with the one he loves, anyway.</P>
