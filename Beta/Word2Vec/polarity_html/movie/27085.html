<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A nifty postmodern cowboy-noir and black comedy, filmed in a drab
Technicolor that seems appropriate for this film, as the colorization is
not ostentatious and thereby makes the characters appear more real. The
story is aimed at striking your funny bone and getting you dizzy in
following all the plot twists. It features all the familiar noir
clichés: femme fatale, an innocent man trapped in the world of
criminals, and is written by the Dahl brothers and directed with
tongue-in-cheek humor by John Dahl, and despite the clichés, the film
feels original.</P>
<P>"Red Rock West" was first released as a video before it had its
theatrical release in a San Francisco theater, where it proved to be a
hit, which got it a limited run across big market city theaters. It's
the type of film that seems to be best-suited for video, where it still
made its biggest splash.</P>
<P>Michael (Cage) is one lucky s.o.b to get out of Vietnam alive with only
a bum leg when his marine outfit was trapped in a bombed building. But
he doesn't seem too lucky now, as he comes from Texas to Wyoming for an
oil rigger's job his friend said was available. He's turned down because
he is decent enough to own up to his bum leg on his job application, but
he finds himself drifting into Red Rock, on a tip from a local that
there might be work there. At the local bar he orders coffee and the
bartender, Wayne Brown (J.T. Walsh), noticing the Caddy he drives and
the Texas license plates, says you must be Lyle from Texas and slides
over five grand and says the other half of the money will be delivered
when you finish the job of killing my wife Suzanne (Lara). Now most
people who are not completely straight and are as broke as Michael and
have a little larceny in their heart, would have just skipped town with
the dough and laughed all the way to Las Vegas. But not our hero...who
is neither straight nor crooked, just a guy who gets into tight spots
and tries to do what is right. And to him, that means mailing an
anonymous letter to the sheriff about the incident and going out to the
ranch to warn Suzanne. She takes it like a real trooper and offers him
double that to kill her husband.</P>
<P>Michael figures he did all he can here and loads up with junk food and
beer and heads out of Red Rock, past the 'Welcome to Red Rock' sign,
which becomes the film's running gag, as he will pass that sign numerous
times in his inability to get out of town. It's a rainy night and he
smashes into a man on the road trying to flag him down. Not able to
leave him by the road, he brings him into the hospital, where it turns
out the man is Suzanne's lover and he has two bullets in his stomach.
The other twist is that the town's sheriff is none other than Wayne. It
seems he bought the election by giving the voters free drinks. When
Wayne sees him at the hospital, he arrests him and takes him down a
backroad where he unsuccessfully tries to kill him. When Michael
escapes, he is picked up by the real Lyle. All this happens in the first
reel.</P>
<P>>From there-on the plot gets more serpentine, the characters become more
loopy and dangerous, and do-gooder Michael comes up against three
desperate snakelike characters who are willing to do anything to get
their hands on a half million dollars that the crooked sheriff has
hidden away. It's all about the money, with the psycho-killer Dennis
Hopper getting more vicious the more insecure he gets, ranting that Cage
thinks that he is better man than him, with Lara being as cold-blooded
and as immoral as any woman could be, while J.T. is slimy and
calculating.</P>
<P>"Red Rock West" is a playful and off-beat thriller, whose only sense it
makes is nonsense, but one that is highly entertaining, while the film
itself is well executed and the acting is dead-pan funny. So it hardly
matters that this murky story is not plausible and certainly not
cerebral. It has received cult status because of its many plot twists
and zany characters, which means it will pop up on late night cable at
any time in the future and that should be for years to come.</P>
