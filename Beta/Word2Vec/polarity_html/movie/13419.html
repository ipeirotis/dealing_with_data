<P>Note: Some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers.
      Be forewarned.</P>
<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   East meets West in MULAN, the latest installment in Disney's parade
   of annual animated feature films.  An odd fusion of ancient Asian
   traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious
   mass-market commercial sensibilities, this confident entry is easily
   the most engaging and satisfying Hollywood animated feature in years,
   but falls short of actualizing its potential.</P>
<P>   Though not for lack of trying.  In many respects, MULAN is among
   Disney's most mature efforts, skirting the surface of adult themes
   and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat.  The
   violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the
   imagery of a pillaged village, neatly encapsulated in the form of a
   child's discarded doll, is in itself no more harrowing than Luke
   discovering his fallen guardians in STAR WARS, and Mulan's later
   heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the
   most tidy, bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a
   Hollywood animated film, long considered as the last safe refuge for
   the innocent, dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in
   such a provocative manner?  In an instant, idealistic Mulan's
   innocence is lost, and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their
   efforts are spent defending.</P>
<P>   The film, based upon an ancient Chinese fable, centers on a spirited
   young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her
   family's obligatory conscript when China finds itself under attack by
   Huns (cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones, replete with
   glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth, although lent a
   surprisingly genuine sense of menace).  Dipping into the mythology of
   other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated
   revisitings of familiar Western / European fables and literature for
   decades, Disney's new film is boldly set in ancient China rather than
   relocated elsewhere, story intact, to some neutral territory, and
   revels in its East Asian roots; aside from a predominantly
   Asian-American cast providing the film's vocal work, there's liberal
   usage of Oriental iconography throughout, and the artwork reveal
   hints of Japanese anime influence.  While the film does occasionally
   reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking
   pseudo-Asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every
   third sentence grows rather hoary, and I can't imagine that the
   regiment for ancient Chinese warriors *really* included
   karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it's rather remarkable that
   a movie primarily positioned for American and European audiences
   delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory.  The film also
   freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset; although
   savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately,
   it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it
   does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and
   traditions of Mulan's land.</P>
<P>   At its core, the film is a tale of heroic adventure, and as such
   paints its story in bold strokes of honour, perseverance, nobility
   and courage.  As such, animation is the perfect vehicle for this
   flavour of epic, where stark emotional simplicity is able to
   effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity.  Scenes which
   would play out as unbearably hokey in live action, such as Mulan's
   venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his
   draft notice, are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater
   emotional clarity in animation.  MULAN capitalizes on this during its
   strongest moments, particularly during our heroine's
   character-defining opening half-hour.</P>
<P>   It's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of
   recent Hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick, the
   colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it
   goes slightly awry.  Off to battle, Mulan finds herself being trailed
   by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called Mushu and an agreeable
   little "lucky" cricket, who ostensibly appear to assist in her
   subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief.
   They're affable presences, and not precisely ineffective --
   reasonable amounts of humour are elicited, and Eddie Murphy (who
   voices Mushu) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high
   melodrama, the effect is mildly jarring and, from a storytelling
   perspective, questionable in its necessity.  At training camp, Mulan
   antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits
   (easily characterized simply as the Short Clown, the Skinny Clown,
   and the Big Clown), who provide more levity into the film with
   decidedly less effectiveness, and, in a familiar retread of
   traditional Disney patterns, she grows a certain fondness for a
   handsome, square-jawed young captain, Shang.  Everybody needs love,
   even ancient Chinese warrior princesses, but not necessarily in
   *this* film. The romantic angle, which lets the air out of the sails
   of the story's neo-feminist underpinnings, lacks any genuine spark
   and plays out like a contractual obligation.</P>
<P>   Another staple of recent Disney animated films, a cache of hummable
   little ditties, has also obligingly been carried over to MULAN but
   proves to be a decided weakness.  Composed by Matthew Wilder, none of
   the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing, and one --
   "I'll Make A Man Out Of You" (unimaginatively accompanying a tired
   montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean
   fighting machines) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems
   almost interminable.  Only "Reflections", an early ballad of lament,
   proves to be a song of any consequence, serving as an effective
   showcase for Lea Salonga, one of musical theatre's most wondrously
   pure voices.</P>
<P>   Nonetheless, MULAN is an especially appealing piece of work from the
   Disney factory, with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork; the
   computer-generated stampede of Hun warriors charging down a snow
   mountain is wholly impressive.  While the blatantly child-friendly
   elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film,
   they're not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable.  Briskly paced
   with a smart, energetic heroine and filled with high adventure, the
   film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father
   and daughter.</P>
