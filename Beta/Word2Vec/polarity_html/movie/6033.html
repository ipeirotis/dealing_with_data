<P>     NO END, the first collaboration between writer-director Krzysztof=20
Kieslowski and lawyer-turned-screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, takes=20
place in a Poland that is under the cloud of martial law.  More than any=20
of the director's other internationally-screened features, this one=20
requires some (however rudimentary) knowledge of the political situation=20
in Poland during the early-to-mid eighties.  Martial law was declared in=20
late 1981, and, in the resulting climate of uncertainty and tension, the=20
courts began to pass two-to-three year sentences on anyone caught=20
painting graffiti, found in possession of an underground newspaper,=20
breaking curfew, or participating in strikes or other resistance=20
activities.  One of Kieslowski's objectives in NO END was to explore=20
potential ramifications of this situation from a noncritical=20
perspective.=20</P>
<P>     Although NO END garnered Kieslowski more overseas recognition that=20
he had attained for CAMERA BUFF, things weren't as pleasant at home. =20
According to the director, this film was not at all well-received during=20
its initial run.  Discussing the Polish reaction to NO END, he said, "It=20
was received terribly by the authorities; it was received terribly by=20
the opposition, and it was received terribly by the Church.  Meaning, by=20
the three powers that be in Poland.  We really got a thrashing over it. =20
Only one element didn't give us a thrashing, and that was the audience=85=20
they went to see it=85 Never in my life have I received as many letters or=
=20
phone calls about a film=85 And all of them, in fact -- I didn't get a=20
single bad letter or call -- said that I'd spoken the truth about=20
martial law.  That that was the way they experienced it, that's what it=20
was like."</P>
<P>     NO END is really three stories in one, all of which revolve around=20
people connected to a lawyer, Antoni Zyro (Jerzy Radziwillowicz), who=20
dies just before the film begins.  There's Ulla (Grazyna Szapolowska,=20
who later appeared in DECALOGUE 6, A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE), the=20
lawyer's widow.  Only after his death does she realize how much she=20
loved her husband and how little meaning her life has without him.  The=20
there's Dariusz (Artur Barcis), Antoni's client, who has been jailed for=20
leading a labor strike.  After Antoni's death, Dariusz is forced to=20
employ an older, more cautious lawyer (Aleksander Bardini), who believes=20
in compromising with the state to obtain a lenient sentence.  Finally,=20
there's the ghost of Antoni, who silently haunts his friends and family,=20
watching as they continue their lives.</P>
<P>     Pre-echoes of BLUE abound in this film.  Ulla's grief over her=20
husband's death is like Julie's in the 1993 feature.  Both women=20
discover their husbands' secrets, and both turn to available men for=20
sexual satisfaction.  Adding to the similarities, Zbigniew Preisner's=20
haunting score for NO END can be heard often during BLUE as a=20
composition by "Van Den Budenmayer".  However, while Ulla's story is NO=20
END's most powerful element, the emotional impact here is less than what=20
Kieslowski achieved with the first installment of his THREE COLORS=20
trilogy.</P>
<P>     From a purely intellectual perspective, Dariusz's story is probably=20
the most intriguing.  His dilemma is simple:  accept his new lawyer's=20
strategy of compromise and go free, or retrain his integrity and go to=20
prison.  Dariusz agonizes over the choice.  He has a wife and child to=20
feed -- something he can't do if he's in jail.  Yet he believes=20
passionately in the rights of the workers and the unfairness of martial=20
law, and it makes him feel like a fraud to consider "selling out." =20
Kieslowski carefully balances both sides of the predicament, presenting=20
them to the audience almost as if asking us to render a verdict.  In the=20
end, Dariusz' decision is perhaps inevitable, but it gives him no joy. =20
Kieslowski uses this sort of ethical and/or moral dilemma frequently in=20
his movies.  CAMERA BUFF, BLIND CHANCE, and DECALOGUE all explore=20
similar situations.</P>
<P>     The metaphysical element of NO END, while intriguing in concept,=20
doesn't work all that well on screen.  We never get much sense for what=20
Antoni's ghost is feeling.  He's only in four scenes, and remains=20
something of an enigma -- an impotent watcher who occasionally attempts=20
to communicate with the living by leaving unexpected signs.  Kieslowski=20
uses Antoni's ghost as a metaphor for the average person constrained by=20
martial law -- possessing a clear conscience yet unable to do anything=20
to affect change.</P>
<P>     The three motifs of NO END frequently cross and occasionally=20
entwine.  Kieslowski doesn't always handle these interconnections well;=20
in fact, there are times when the different stories mesh clumsily. =20
Nevertheless, the film is so packed with ideas that there's never any=20
shortage of material worth pondering, and Ulla's emotional torment=20
touches the heart.  Even though elements of the whole don't blend=20
seamlessly, NO END still leaves a lasting impression.  Looking back on=20
the full body of Kieslowski's films, NO END can be viewed as an=20
important entry, because, despite its flaws, we can observe embryonic=20
forms of several themes that the director explored more fully in=20
DECALOGUE and THREE COLORS.  Thus, NO END functions both as a compliment=20
and a precursor to the director's most lasting works.</P>
