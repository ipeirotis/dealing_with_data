<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Much ado is made about aspidistra in this comedy adapted from the
semi-autobiographical novel of George Orwell. It's a hardy houseplant,
used in the story to connote middle-class London respectability when
placed on the windowsill of a flat and in the lowclass Lambeth
neighborhood, it is offered to the impoverished bookstore clerk as a
sign of affection by his kindly landlady. The plant acts as a metaphor,
indicating that the confused young hero of the film can't escape his
middle-class destiny. His landlady in his middle-class, immaculate flat,
Mrs. Meakin (Liz Smith), is actually the most diverting one in the film,
her nose lifts upward in snooty sarcasm, capturing all you have to know
about the direction this film is heading, as she reacts to the poet's
one night drinking binge that got in the papers and got him fired from
his Hampstead bookstore job and kicked out of Mrs. Meakin's flat. The
aspidistra's in her place seem cold and hostile to the troubled young
poet. They show how stuffy and pretentious life is in a suburban
neighborhood, while in a slum the people have nothing to lose, so they
are free to speak their mind, and social restrictions are not as tensely
kept.</P>
<P>The upper-class are royally seen through the depiction of Ravelston
(Wadham), a wealthy publisher, who has the luxury of having sex in the
afternoon with his acid-tongued priggish girlfriend (Vickerage) and
living a care-free existence in his spacious townhouse. He even
considers himself to be a socialist, which is ridiculed by his stodgy
mannerisms and snobbish attitude.</P>
<P>There's a point to be made in this 1930s depression satire about money
counting for everything, and this point is hammered into every aspect of
the story, until it gets to be not only redundant, but outright
irritating to hear. The would-be poet Gordon Comstock (Grant), who is
unsatisfied with his success and promotion in an adverting firm, where
he is writing advertising slogans, impulsively quits his job when he
gets a good review in a London newspaper for one one of his poetry books
published by his friend Ravelston. He narcissistically dreams of
international fame and entry into the poetry world of Auden and T.S.
Eliot. His girlfriend and co-worker, Rosemary (Helena Bonham Carter),
does the graphic art for his slogans and is happy to be a petitioner of
middle-class values, which is what her boyfriend tells her he is
rejecting. Her role in the film is to wait for him to come to his senses
and join her willingly in matrimony, which he will do after he
experiences the harshness of poverty, tires of roaming the streets
composing banal poems, and accepts responsibility for making Rosemary
pregnant. His boss is Erskine (Jim Carter), who makes money from
Gordon's wordsmith skills, therefore is disappointed that he quit, but
leaves the job open for him if he wishes to return.</P>
<P>The story quickly makes its point, as valid as it might be in Orwell's
novel, here it seems trivial, that people delude themselves into
thinking that they are the next Shakespeare and spend a miserable time
living in poverty or doing what they shouldn't be doing, when they would
be much happier being accepted into the middle-class where they duly
belong. It's a fair enough point made, but the story has this nasty
habit of being saccharine to a point, where its sugary qualities could
be fatal to the viewer's heart. Even the scenes of poverty are
sugar-coated, making everything look so awfully nice. The film shows how
foolish the young man was in giving up his career work in which he shows
an aptitude for, and foolishly chooses something he was not born to do,
trying to be a William Blake, who was endowed with a rich poetical
imagination, therefore could live joyously in an indigent state in
Lambeth and still be creative. Something Gordon can't do. It also,
somehow, stretches the point of art and advertisement having much in
common, cynically stating there is little difference between how they
achieve their ends.</P>
<P>It just became dull watching all the clichés about the classes bantered
back and forth, with the picturesque view of Gordon descending into
poverty, working in a musty Lambeth bookstore, and the creamy richness
of his return to middle-class life when the film ends on a happy note,
as he returns to his former place of work to cheers from his colleagues
and into the warm embraces of his girlfriend and back into the good
graces of his stolid middle-class sister (Harriet), and back to his
eager boss who is only too glad to hire him again.</P>
<P>The message I got, as I watched this tepid middle-brow, so-called art
film, is that living in poverty can be stifling, and that kind of life
is not what makes an artist. What the film had to offer, was nothing
more than seeing a few artists names referred to, some inferences that
there is a merry war going on between men and women, some mild
invectives about class differences, and all of life's battle were
condensed to being about money matters. For a movie railing against
accepting bourgeoisie values - it instead becomes a movie that ends up
glorifying those values. Its final message is that there is no escape
from one's destiny.</P>
<P>If one looked hard enough, there can be found some wit in Gordon's
portrayal of a likable jerk with artistic ambitions and some charm in
his relationship with Rosemary. But this uninspired script cannot find
anything relevant to say to make this satire meaningful. In fact, it
makes a mockery of Orwell's intentions to sympathize with an artist who
is prepared to make his own way in the world...Orwell's "Down and Out in
Paris and London" offers a more interesting take he has on being poor,
as he worked for a time as a dishwasher and in a Hampstead bookstore as
a clerk. You'll get a better feel of what Orwell was trying to satirize
reading that book than you will by seeing this film.</P>
