<P>     Seventy-nine weeks -- count them, seventy-nine -- is all that
separates the release of A VERY BRADY SEQUEL from THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE,
in what has to rank as one of the fastest sequel turnarounds in film
history.  Even taking into account the fact that the Brady house sets and
Alice's uniform were already available, that's a tidy 18 months for
writing the script, pre-production, shooting and post-production.  You
might expect a rather perfunctory piece of film-making given those
circumstances, and you would find it.  A VERY BRADY SEQUEL has some cute
moments, but it is lacking the sense of direction which made THE BRADY
BUNCH MOVIE such a guilty pleasure.</P>
<P>     The sequel finds all the BRADY cast members (except for David Graf as
Sam the butcher) exactly where we left them at the end of the last movie,
happily stuck in the 1970s while the world around them spins a quarter
century faster.  All seems typically groovy for Mike (Gary Cole), Carol
(Shelley Long) and the clan until they receive a visit from a man who says
he is Roy Martin (Tim Matheson)...Carol's first husband, a globe-trotting
archaeologist lost and presumed dead many years earlier.  This throws the
household into turmoil.  Carol and Mike are confused over how to deal with
this news, Greg (Christopher Daniel Barnes) and Marcia (Christine Taylor)
are confused over feelings about each other, and Jan (Jennifer Elise
Cox)...well, as usual, she's just confused.  But all of them should be
more concerned about Roy, who primarily seems concerned about the
whereabouts of a horse statue which could be worth a fortune.</P>
<P>     THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE arrived in the middle of a slew of T.V.-to-film
re-treads, so it was easy to overlook the fact that there was actually a
point to it besides gratuitous nostalgia.  Even as the film made
referrence to "classic" Brady plots, it also provided the wonderful
conceit of sealing the Bradys in a bubble of obliviousness while time had
marched on for everyone else, and it made for a genuinely entertaining
remembrance of a simpler time with simpler problems.  A VERY BRADY SEQUEL
misses the boat on both counts.  There isn't nearly enough juxtaposition
between the Bradys and the modern world; most of the film seems to take
place in the Brady house, with only a sarcastic Matheson to react.  There
is one funny bit in which Mike speaks to a police detective ("Homicide's"
Richard Belzer) in a police station where everything around him is filmed
in the unsteady hand-held style of modern crime dramas, while Mike himself
is an island of stable serenity.  Too often, however, the Bradys end up
interacting just with each other, repeating 70s catch phrases and
mimicking their television counterparts.</P>
<P>     As for the echoes of the original series, the most memorable were
already used in the first film.  We do get a detailed re-creation of Jan's
imaginary boyfriend George Glass, and token references to other episodes
like the Hawaiian vacation shows (don't be fooled by ads which make it
look like the entire film is set in Hawaii; the Bradys don't hit the
islands until about twenty minutes remain), but A VERY BRADY SEQUEL
doesn't provide the same warmth of familiarity.  Instead, it spends a lot
of time playing with sexual tension between Greg and Marcia as the
realization that they aren't _really_ related puts interesting ideas in
their heads.  There are a few solid laughs in that sub-plot, but
unfortunately it underlines an over-reliance on sexual double-entendre of
a staggering obviousness.  I suppose a limited time frame to work on a
script can make you leap for the easy gag.</P>
<P>     Still, A VERY BRADY SEQUEL does have the same superb cast to draw on,
and they make for a film which seems more creative than it actually is.
Jennifer Elise Cox again has the showcase role of neglected middle child
Jan, and dumping her psychotic "inner voice" makes her desperation for
attention a bit more fun.  Gary Cole is also priceless -- it's hard to
imagine a more convincingly earnest square, or someone else delivering a
line like, "So what are your plans now that you're alive?" as though it
almost made sense.  A VERY BRADY SEQUEL is occasionally cute, directed
competently by Arlene Sanford, but it's rarely clever.  Someone had an
idea in mind when they made the first film, and that's true of the sequel
as well.  It's just that the idea this time was closer to, "Let's get this
thing out there while the kids still look like kids."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 retro actions:  5.</PRE>
