<P>In the opening shot of Midnight Cowboy, we see a close-up of a blank movie
screen at a drive-in. We hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping
of horses' hooves. Without an image projected onto the screen, the audience
unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing Indians and can
spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our
mind's eye. Even without having seen a cowboys and Indians movie, somehow
the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental
schema. But do cowboys really exist, or are they merely Hollywood images
personified by John Wayne and Gary Cooper? Exploring this theme, director
John Schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the American
Dream, an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept. Is the ease at which
salvation and success can be attained in America a hallmark of its
experience or an urban legend? Midnight Cowboy suggests that the American
Dream, like image of the cowboy, is merely a myth. As Joe Buck migrates from
place to place, he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to
create a life for himself, only further degeneration.</P>
<P>During the opening credits, Joe walks past an abandoned theater whose
decrepit marquee reads `John Wayne: The Alamo.' As Joe is on the bus
listening to a radio talk show, a lady on the air describes her ideal man as
`Gary Cooper… but he's dead.' A troubled expression comes across Joe's face,
as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone. Having adopted the image of a
cowboy since youth, Joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried
to embody. Joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an
analogue to his American Dream. He romanticizes about making it in the big
city, but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his
ideals for sustenance. By the end of Midnight Cowboy, Joe Buck loses
everything and gains nothing. Just as the audience can picture cowboys
chasing Indians on a blank screen, we can also conjure up scenes from Pretty
Woman as paradigms of American redemption and success. But how realistic are
these ideals? Joe had raped and been raped in Texas. The scars of his
troubled past prompt him to migrate to New York, but he does not know that
his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in
Texas.</P>
<P>Alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation. The ability to
pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive American
convention. Schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to Joe's abusive
and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with Crazy Anne
and Granny. We understand that Joe adopts the façade of a cowboy, a symbol
of virility and gallantry, as an attempt to neutralize his shame. He runs
from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual
experiences in New York. In the scene at the diner which foreshadows Joe's
encounter with the gay student, Joe Buck spills ketchup on himself. Standing
up, we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his
pants down his thigh. Schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of Joe's
virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals, signifying
emasculation. Beyond the symbol of castration, the scene may also connote
the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter, a reference to Joe's
first homosexual liaison. The fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is
relegated only to females furthers the imagery of Joe's emasculation. It is
ironic that Joe has trouble prospecting for female clients, but effortlessly
attracts men. Joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his
masculinity; New Yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff.'</P>
<P>There are two predominant images of New York. The first is that New York is
the rich, cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the
tall skyscrapers and the Statue of Liberty. The other New York is Travis
Bickle's New York, a seedy, corruptive hell on Earth. Joe envisions New York
as the former, but is presented with the latter. Mirroring the irony in
which Joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine, he mistakenly buys into
the fable that New York is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men.
Joe thinks he is performing a great service for New York, but the city rapes
him of his pride and possessions. The people steal Joe's money, the landlord
confiscates his luggage, and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity. What
has become of Joe's American Dream? Schlesinger responds to this question
with the scene at the party. Joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at
the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food, drugs, and sex. At the
party, all of Joe and Ratzo's desires are made flesh; Joe flirts
successfully with women and Ratzo loads up on free salami. Contrasting Joe's
daily struggles, shots of Warhol's crew display wanton indulgence. There is
an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude; we see a shot of a woman
kowtowing to nothing in particular, orgies breaking out in the periphery,
and drugs passed around like party favors. The party makes a mockery of Joe'
s ideals. Joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for
success in America; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with Shirley
suggest that  it is the idle who profit from Joe's toils. The American
Dream, Schlesinger suggests, is merely a proletarian fantasy, for those who
are content no longer dream, but become indolent.</P>
<P>As Joe heads to Miami, all that was significant of the cowboy image has left
him. His masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished. For
Joe, nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately, he surrenders
the identity. Tossing his boots into the garbage, he returns to the bus for
the last leg of his journey to Miami. The final shot of Midnight Cowboy
shows Joe inside the bus, more introspective, taking only a few glances
outside the window. Instead of the frequent POV shots of Joe excitedly
looking out of the bus on his way to New York,  Schlesinger sets up this
final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at
Joe. Reflections of the palm trees Ratzo so raved about run across the bus'
window with Joe hardly taking notice. The scenery of Miami no longer exacts
the same excitement from Joe as before. The world seems smaller to Joe now;
the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his
American Dream. No longer does Joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo; he
resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means.</P>
<P>Midnight Cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the American Dream.
There is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few
Indians, you can set up a ranch out West and raise a beautiful family. Then
there is the Jay Gatsby dream that a man of humble stock, with perseverance,
can make a fortune in the big city. Joe's attempt to realize these dreams
robs him of his innocence in Texas and morality in New York. During his
search for an intangible paradise, Joe ends up raping a girl and killing a
man. An allegory of chasing the promise of the American Dream, Joe Buck's
progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory
icons.</P>
