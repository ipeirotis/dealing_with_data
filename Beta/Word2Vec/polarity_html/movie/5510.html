<P>     Goran Paskaljevic's SOMEONE ELSE'S AMERICA is a modern-day tale of 
the immigration experience.  Despite the complexities of today's socio-
political situation, where illegal aliens enter the United States 
seemingly at will to work in sweat shops at sub-minimum wage jobs, the 
lure of the American Dream sings its siren song to men and women 
worldwide.  Ellis Island may be a tourist site, but the Statue of 
Liberty still stands tall, beckoning the tired, the poor, and those 
yearning to breathe free.</P>
<P>     Paskaljevic's film reminds us that simple tales are often the most 
affecting.  Nothing of world-shaking importance transpires during 
SOMEONE ELSE'S AMERICA's 96-minute running time.  We're introduced to a 
pair of characters, then follow their trials and tribulations as they 
attempt to adapt to their new surroundings.  Nevertheless, this movie is 
an insightful examination of the differences with which members of the 
same family react to being uprooted from their native land and 
transplanted to a strange country.  </P>
<P>     SOMEONE ELSE'S AMERICA opens in Brooklyn, across the East River 
from Manhattan, where the skyscrapers loom like a steel-and-concrete 
promise forever beyond the immigrants' reach.  As photographed by Yorgos 
Arvantis, Manhattan is cold and beautiful.  Bayo (Miki Manojilovic, TITO 
AND ME), from Montenegro, has been in the United States for less than a 
year, doing odd-jobs for his Spaniard friend, Alonso (Tom Conti, SHIRLEY 
VALENTINE).  In his spare time, he works with a crew of other illegal 
aliens, wearing a gas mask and cleaning up toxic waste sites.  The money 
he earns, he sends home, where his mother and three children still 
reside.  Not for long, however, as it turns out.  Spurred by the desire 
of Bayo's oldest son, Luka (Sergej Trifunovic), to reach the new world, 
the four embark on an ocean voyage to Mexico, where a "travel guide" 
agrees to take them north of the border.  Tragedy strikes as they cross 
the Rio Grande -- Bayo's youngest son is swept away in the currents, and 
the family's subsequent reunion becomes a sad event.</P>
<P>     Three generations offer three different perspectives of immigrating 
to America.  When asked why he crossed the ocean, Bayo responds that, 
though he would love to go back home, he has to remind himself daily 
that he came here to build a future for his two youngest children.  
Bayo's mother, however, hates New York.  "I don't know how to live 
here... it's someone else's country," she laments.  Responding to her, 
Luka says, "There's nothing for us [back in Montenegro]."  He has come 
to the United States to forge his dreams, and, by making himself 
invaluable to Alonso and marrying a Chinese American citizen, he takes 
strides in that direction.  But Bayo blames Luka for the Rio Grande 
disaster, and their relationship becomes strained.</P>
<P>     One of the reasons SOMEONE ELSE'S AMERICA is so effective is that 
it shuns melodrama.  This low-key tale concentrates on family dynamics 
and interpersonal relationships rather than making political statements 
or toying with the audience's emotions.  Paskaljevic accepts that 
immigrating to the United States is what it is, and concentrates not on 
condemning the process, but exploring how it affects those who, for 
better or worse, make the attempt.  This is a tragic comedy, with 
moments of wry, unforced humor peppering the drama.  Because of its 
positive outlook on life, SOMEONE ELSE'S AMERICA isn't a downer, but, 
like last year's LAMERICA, it prompts viewers to consider how much 
courage and sacrifice is demanded for an individual to risk moving from 
one country to another.  It also encourages understanding of why 
newcomers to this country cling so desperately to traditions and customs 
of the one left behind.  </P>
