SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     "Furniture is temporary; education is forever," Murray Abramowitz 
lectures his kids in writer and director Tamara Jenkins's tale of modern 
nomads living in poverty in the shadows of great wealth.</P>
<P>     As Murray, Alan Arkin delivers a heartfelt and bittersweet 
performance as a working father whose two talents in life are mooching 
off his older brother and (just barely) scraping by.  He wakes the kids 
in the dead of night every few months so they can steal away without 
paying the rent at one cheap apartment in order to pull the same scam 
later at a new one.  (Many will write this off as a plot device, but 
since I have one close relative whose family got by with a similar ruse 
in the Great Depression, I could identify with their plight.)  The 
Abramowitzs live in squat, ugly, stucco boxes with ironic names like the 
"Casa Bella" apartments.</P>
<P>     Murray wants only the best for his children with his favorite treat 
being steak for breakfast so that the meat will strengthen them.  When 
the kids want to move to some place cheaper, like Torrance, he 
vociferously tells them no.  "We're staying in Beverly Hills for the 
good schools and the good address," he explains resolutely.  Even if 
they have to live in what goes for slum housing on the outskirts of the 
stars' homes, they are in the right ZIP code and school district.</P>
<P>     It would have been easier to have had Murray be unemployed, but the 
smart script gives Murray a job -- user car salesmen -- without the 
skills to make much money from it.  Arkin is quite convincing as a dad 
who adores his family but is a failure as a breadwinner.  He's ashamed 
of having to grovel and cheat, but he does whatever is necessary for his 
family and himself.  In a telling scene, he has a chance to send his 
three kids back to his ex-wife, but, as a senior citizen, he admits that 
his children provide him his raison d'être.</P>
<P>     His only daughter, Vivian, is the film's central character.  Played 
with spunk by the big, expressive-eyed Natasha Lyonne, teenage Vivian 
exudes pathos as a girl bursting, rather reluctantly, into adolescence.  
Set in the summer of 1976, the movie focuses on Vivian's suspected 
"deformity."  </P>
<P>     "What seems to be the problem?" asks the tony Beverly Hills doctor 
whom a friend had recommend she see to fix her problem.  "Breasts!" she 
retorts disgustedly.  The poor girl is aghast to find that she has 
developed full-fledged breasts.  She's sure that they are so large that 
people will laugh at her so breast reduction surgery might be just the 
answer.</P>
<P>     Marisa Tomei plays Rita, the 29-year-old daughter of Murray's older 
brother.  She is a free spirit who likes flashing her breasts in order 
to hitch rides.  Rita, who just left rehab, temporarily joins Murray's 
family in another one of Murray's schemes to extort money from his 
brother.  While there, she and Vivian hit it off.  The best scenes of 
them involve Rita's vibrator, which they use to put on a dance routine a 
la SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER in their shared bedroom.  Vivian, in a delicate, 
funny, and slightly erotic scene, finds even better uses for the 
vibrator when Rita isn't there.</P>
<P>     The comedy rarely subsides, and yet the picture is more touching 
than funny.  Director Jenkins has a deft touch in blending in plenty of 
humor to keep us interested while she weaves a poignant tale of a 
struggling family who manage to always keep their heads up and their 
bags packed.</P>
<P>     SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS runs 1:31.  It is rated R for sex, nudity, 
profanity and drug content, and would be fine for older teenagers.</P>
