<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Transplanted Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung, the 31-year-old now
living in France since 1975, makes his debut film a lush, lyrical story
about a peasant girl, Mui (Man San Lu-age 10). She comes from her
country village to Saigon in 1951 to be a servant in a bourgeois
household consisting of--the old servant (Nguyen Anh Hoa), grandmother
(Thi Hai Vo), three sons (Gerard Neth/Nhat Do/Keo Souvannavong), the
master of the house (Ngoc Trung Tran), and his wife (Thi Loc Truong).</P>
<P>"The Scent of Green Papaya" is a quiet, sensuous, apolitical, slow-paced
film which makes it a point to clearly detail the everyday existence in
the Vietnam of the rich and their servants in the 1950s, and it is also
about the changing life in Vietnam (filmed, amazingly, on a Paris indoor
set); it views the changes from the old ways to the changes incurring
due to the influences from the West that came in the 1960s. It traces in
particular the aspects of women's work and their servitude that covers a
10-year period - from 1951 to 1961. It is seen through the eyes of Mui.
She absorbs the serene music played in the rich household by the father
on the lute and his eldest son Trung on the flute and the enormously
sweet girl, with the radiant smile, shows how she optimistically finds
satisfaction with her lot in life as a poor servant.</P>
<P>Mui is shown her duties by the old servant, who carefully shows her how
to prepare the papaya (which is traditionally woman's work) and answers
all the child's curious questions about the household. The child will
also serve the meals, clean the house, wash the clothes, and run
errands. The mistress of the house is especially fond of her and treats
her with utmost kindness as she reminds her of the daughter she lost to
a disease, who would have been the same age as Mui. The master of the
house is guilt-ridden because his daughter died when he ran away from
home and he only returned after her death, and was sickened so much over
that incident that he promised not to take off again. He has a history
of disrupting the family by periodically disappearing with the family
savings for long periods of womanizing. He causes much pain for his hard
working wife, who earns money for the household by selling cloth.
Because of this the young child Tin, in particular, acts unruly, taking
it out mostly on Mui.</P>
<P>But Mui seems oblivious to the family tragedies, as she keys in on the
simple pleasures of life. She loves cooking the papaya, doing her chores
in an unobtrusive manner, and tuning in to the wonderous nature around
her.</P>
<P>Mui is attracted to a rich friend of Trung's, Khuyen (Hoa Hoi Vuong),
someone who is a classical pianist and frequently visits the house for
dinner. The first part of the film ends as the family suffers the loss
of the master who kept his word for seven years, since the death of his
daughter, but now has run away with another woman, taking with him the
household money.</P>
<P>In 1961, ten years after the master's death, the 20-year-old Mui
(Yên-Khê Tran-the director's real-life fiancée) is still content working
for this troubled family but she is let go because of economic reasons
and will become the servant to Khuyen. She will now do her preparing of
the papaya with a more womanly intimacy and an engaging relationship
grows between her and him, as he finally notices the servant is an
alluring woman. The second part of the film pales in comparison to part
one, and that is because the innocent Mui as a child was the glue that
held the film together and made it seem so special. The older Mui
doesn't radiate the same warmth on the screen.</P>
<P>This is a very pleasing and subtle tale about the strength of the human
spirit and the artistic quietude one has when finding peace within one's
self. It is about a traditional culture that is no longer common, if it
exists at all, since the Vietnam War. A terrific film, one of tremendous
visual beauty, but one that steers clear of any overt political
messages. At Cannes, it was named the best film by a first-time
director. It also received a nomination for Best Foreign film at the
Oscars.</P>
