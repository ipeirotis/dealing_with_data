FINDING FORRESTER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In FINDING FORRESTER, director Gus Van Sant, who last gave us a 
shot-by-shot reconstruction of Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, returns to the 
same familiar subject matter of the young and gifted that he pursued in 
GOOD WILL HUNTING.  This time the story concerns a black, 16-year-old 
writer, Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown), who leaves his run-down Bronx school 
to attend Mailor, a prestigious private school in Manhattan.  Although 
he is awarded an academic scholarship, he is expected to help Mailor win 
the basketball championship.</P>
<P>Ironically, first-time screenwriter Mike Rich has fashioned a remarkably 
thin story about a first-time writer.  Fully three quarters of the movie 
elapses before it finally gets to the big "plagiarism" incident, which 
like every twist is telegraphed way in advance.  Although Rich pads the 
story with many inconsequential incidents, he permits us just one 
glimpse at Jamal's writings.  The lone example shows only that Jamal 
picks heart-felt, close-to-home subjects.  We get no sense of his 
literary abilities.  We are allowed, mainly in practice sessions, to 
view some of his basketball prowess, but that isn't important since the 
point of the film, after all, is his writing.</P>
<P>Jamal's mentor is a Pulitzer Prize winner, William Forrester (Sean 
Connery), who lives a hermit's existence in an old apartment above the 
court where Jamal and his buddies play basketball.  William, who will 
remind many of J.D. Salinger, wrote one book a half century ago and 
quit.  No longer venturing from his place, he has food and fresh sox 
brought to him, and he views the world like a voyeur from his apartment 
window.  On a dare, Jamal sneaks into William's apartment.  Accidentally 
leaving behind his writings, Jamal gets them thrown back with comments 
both snide ("constipated thinking") and encouraging ("This passage is 
fantastic.") scrawled on them by William.</P>
<P>Brown and Connery deliver nice, albeit not exceptional, performances.  
The easy going chemistry between them has remarkably few rough edges and 
is a pleasure to watch.</P>
<P>William's teaching style is to let Jamal, using an old typewriter, take 
William's words as a starting point and to mold them into his own.  As 
Jamal bangs away on the keyboard, William throws out homilies such as, 
"The first key to writing is to write, not to think."  And they agree 
that starting a sentence with a conjunction is a good writing choice 
even if it does violate some old-fashioned rules.  But one shouldn't do 
it too often.</P>
<P>F. Murray Abraham plays the clichéd Professor Spence, a man who couldn't 
write so he teaches writing.  In fact -- you've got to love these 
coincidences -- it was none other than William himself who put the 
quietus on the good professor's last book attempt by calling his 
publishers and advising them not to publish it.   Let me give you a 
flavor of the level of predictability in the script.  Do you think that 
there will be a key confrontation scene late in the story between these 
two old protagonists?  Who would you guess will prevail?</P>
<P>Anna Paquin (THE PIANO) is completely wasted in an underwritten part as 
Jamal's friend, Claire.  Other than smile and talk about her rich father 
-- he fixed it so the school would go coed just so she could join -- 
Paquin doesn't have anything to do.  A big scene for her is one in which 
she puts her hand on Jamal's in order to reassure him that he will get 
past his one big crisis.</P>
<P>The film works best as a light comedy, and there are many satisfying, 
albeit small, laughs.  Generally, the movie aspires to be something 
more, but its retreaded dialog keeps getting in the way.  "God, he's a 
basketball player from the Bronx!" the professor says of Jamal, as a way 
to prove that Jamal must not have the intellectual capacity to be 
writing the papers that he has been turning in for credit.</P>
<P>Sometimes it is the small things that trouble you about a production.  
Mailor is supposed to be the best private school on the East Coast, and 
much is made of the importance of its basketball team.  When we finally 
see their games, Van Sant has set them in a gym so small that there 
isn't more than five feet on each side of the court, leaving room for no 
more than a few dozen fans.  And then they switch to a packed Madison 
Square Garden for the championship.  Sure.</P>
<P>Don't leave before the epilogue.  There is an Academy Award winner who 
acts in a little uncredited part.  If you like the movie, this epilogue 
could be the best part.  The film, however, left me relatively unmoved.  
Still, it is always good to see Connery, and newcomer Brown shows a lot 
of promise.</P>
<P>FINDING FORRESTER runs a little over two hours.  It is rated PG-13 for 
brief strong language and some sexual references and would be acceptable 
for kids around 12 and up.</P>
