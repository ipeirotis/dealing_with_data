<P>The place and time are Beijing, 1964.  Rene Gallimard, an accountant 
working for the French Embassy, has just arrived in China.  Early in his 
tenure, he attends a performance of Puccini's MADAME BUTTERFLY performed 
by the outspoken and exotic singer Song Liling (John Lone), who is 
actually a man masquerading as a woman.  Not recognizing this, Gallimard 
proceeds to pursue an affair with Liling, never once recognizing that he 
is being duped.  However, the deception goes even deeper, for Liling is 
working for the Communist government and using the relationship with 
Gallimard to procure important French intelligence.</P>
<P>The main problem with M. BUTTERFLY is one of credibility.  All other 
issues momentarily aside, there is a huge question that needs to be 
answered:  How can Gallimard have lived with, and made love to, this 
person for eighteen years, yet not recognized that Liling is actually a 
man?  No firm solution is given, and the subject is only tackled in the 
most oblique and unsatisfactory manner.</P>
<P>The first half of M. BUTTERFLY, which takes place in China, is far better 
than the disastrously-constructed final portion (in France).  While the 
romance between Gallimard and Liling isn't particularly effective (Jeremy 
Irons generates about as much heat as an ice cube), there are at least 
some interesting ideas presented here which, if nothing else, provide 
fodder for the intellect.  Liling has some uncompromising opinions about 
the roles of men and women in society.  In answer to the question of why 
men are frequently used to take on the roles of women in Chinese operas, 
his response is: "Because only men know how women are supposed to act."</P>
<P>As a whole, the plot doesn't pay much attention to reality, despite 
having been based on a true-to-life scandal.  There are a lot of little 
things that simply don't ring true.  </P>
<P>Yet, despite all the problems, M. BUTTERFLY remains strangely compelling 
through most of the first hour, and a great deal of the credit for this 
must go to actor John Lone, who does an excellent job in a challenging 
role.  However, when the scene shifts to Paris, the story gets so 
disjointed and confused that it's impossible to know what to think.  </P>
<P>The final confrontation between Gallimard and Liling as a man, is a dud.  
There's no connection between these two, and it's difficult to accept 
that they've lived together as husband and wife for so many years.  The 
emotions released are obviously not heartfelt, and the lack of any 
genuine catharsis leaves the audience detached and frustrated.  With his 
shedding of female garb, Lone loses the bulk of his charisma.</P>
<P>The final scene is artsy, symbolic, pretentious, and empty.  Rarely have 
I been more disgusted by a supposedly-intelligent film's choice of 
"resolutions".  I had thought Cronenberg a better craftperson than this.</P>
<P>Needless to say, there are similarities between M. BUTTERFLY and THE 
CRYING GAME, but beyond the switched-gender portrayals, there isn't much 
substance to the comparisons.  The bulk of THE CRYING GAME makes sense; 
the same cannot be said about this movie.  There are also a few issues 
touched on here that are presented far more effectively in FAREWELL MY 
CONCUBINE.  </P>
<P>Jeremy Irons has done some excellent work in the past, but he is badly 
miscast here (as he was in Louis Malle's DAMAGE).  The role of Gallimard 
demands an actor who can effectively convey deeply-felt passions and a 
driving obsession, tasks that Irons appears incapable of.  He is flat, so 
the movie, which is told almost exclusively from his perspective, 
sputters and fizzles helplessly.</P>
<P>M. BUTTERFLY disappoints in almost every area, which is a shame 
considering the high regard with which the play has been received.  The 
movie, however, seems to make the wrong decision at almost every 
opportunity, trying for the kind of melodramatic tragedy that only works 
in opera.  Motion pictures like this need a firm grounding in reality 
which, sadly, Cronenberg has failed to provide.  As a result, M. 
BUTTERFLY never gets out of the cocoon.</P>
