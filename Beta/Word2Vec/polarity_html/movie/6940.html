<PRE>                               THAT DARN CAT
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     "I'm so upset," says Mrs. Flint (Dyan Cannon).  "I'd cry, but my
tear ducts haven't worked since my last eye job."  Her maid has been
kidnapped and is being held for ransom.  This is one of the better
pieces of dialog in Disney's remake of THAT DARN CAT, but it, like the
rest of the humor in the show, elicits little laughter.  The film is so
bad that I found myself wishing it had a laugh track.  With a laugh
track I could at least pretend the movie was funny.</P>
<P>     I am careful to warn my readers about films.  For this one there
is a simple admonition: Get coffee.  Unless you imbibe significant
amounts of caffeine before entering the theater, you stand a good
chance of not being able to stay awake through the many long and dull
parts.  We had four adults in our party, and two of them kept nodding
off.</P>
<P>     The original 1965 movie version of THAT DARN CAT starred Hayley
Mills and Dean Jones.  (Jones, playing Mr. Flint, has a small part in
the remake.)  It was not the sort of classic film that might suggest
that a remake was in order nor did the remake's producer, Robert
Simonds, have any fresh ideas for the project.  The film appears to
have been made solely for a quick profit.  Simonds seems to have
figured that any Disney film featuring a animal had to be a success.
The remake is devoid of imagination and creative energy.</P>
<P>     The putative star of the show is a cat named D.C.  D.C. is owned
by angst-filled teenager Patti Randall (Christina Ricci).  Patti
explains that she wears all black because that is how her soul feels.
Ricci gives a lifeless performance.  Perhaps she should have heeded my
coffee advice.</P>
<P>     D.C. roams the town every night at 8:00, and on one of his
excursions he finds the kidnapped maid.  The maid gives D.C. her watch
on which she has started writing the word "help."  Patti takes the
watch to the FBI and shows it to Agent Zeke Kelso.  This part, which
was acted by Jones in the original, is played for broad humor by Doug
E.  Doug in the remake.  Although I hated Doug's performance, I do give
him credit for being the only actor to exert any effort.  The others
are on autopilot.</P>
<P>     Even the cat in the picture is given nothing challenging to do.
Most scenes of D.C., played by a cat named Elvis, have him running
across rooftops.  Except for the one scene where he growls, his single
expression is as boring as the rest of the picture.  I have three cats,
and all are more emotive than D.C.</P>
<P>     As a cat lover, my favorite scene in the picture an FBI agent
ordering D.C. to move.  "Go, go, go!" he demands, but the cat is
unimpressed.  Patti looks the agent sternly in the eye and says,
"You're not a cat person, are you?"</P>
<P>     Most of the film relies on sight gags that you have seen a million
times before.  There is a board in the fence that swings around and
hits people and animals on the head.  People fall down stairs.  One
character tries walking but finds that he has a trash can stuck on his
foot.  Etc., ad nauseam.</P>
<P>     In a typically unfunny scene Kelso comes to Patti's rescue.  "You
smell really bad," says Patti.  "What happened?"  The agent explains,
"Got into a fight with a dumpster and lost."</P>
<P>     When everything else fails, go for explosions and car chases.
Director Bob Spiers, whose previous experience was directing television
series, tries to end the show with a bang, but the lengthy chase scene
is as repetitive and tiring as the rest of the picture.</P>
<P>     The show's biggest conundrum is the script.  It has no ingenuity
and yet is by the same creative writing team of S. M. Alexander and L.
A. Karaszewski who won the Golden Globe award for THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY
FLYNT.  They also did the script for ED WOOD.  Both of these scripts
are wonderful and highly creative.  Although I do not understand it, I
think there may be a hint in the press kit.  Every one associated with
the film has a lengthy biography except for them.  It just says they
live in LA and have been writing together for ten years.  No mention is
made of their previous pictures.  Could it be because they whipped up
this screenplay without much thought, and now want to disassociate
themselves from the project?</P>
<P>     Too often critics are too easy on kids' movies.  If the pictures
are lifeless but harmless, they give them two stars.  This version of
THAT DARN CAT has nothing to challenge minds of any age, and the jokes
are pathetic.  Whereas I do not doubt that many kids will like it, it
could and should have been so much better.  Why shouldn't we aim a bit
higher for our youngsters?  Intelligent scripts can be both successful
and funny, as the one for TOY STORY proved.</P>
<P>     THAT DARN CAT runs 1:39.  It is rated PG for some explosions and
one mild expletive.  It would be fine for most kids although the loud
noises might scare some kids under 4.  My son Jeffrey and his friend
Kerry, both about 8, give the show thumbs up.  Their favorite line is
the one about coughing up a hairball.  I give this pitiful excuse for a
movie thumbs down and a single *.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
