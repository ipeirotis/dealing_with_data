<PRE>SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1998) *** (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        Call me crazy, but I don't see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN as the film 
of the summer. A good movie, yes, with chillingly realistic battle 
scenes and emotion to spare. An utterly riviting movie on par with 
Steven Spielberg's best work, no. Personally, if I was Spielberg, I 
wouldn't go back to the World War II era one more time after 
SCHINDLER'S LIST and the Indiana Jones movies. I'm guessing Steve has 
a thing for Nazis; I really wouldn't be surprised if a velociraptor ate 
one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next JURASSIC PARK movie.</P>
<P>        All lofty pretenses aside, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is the goriest 
movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick. The difference is, it's easy 
during FRIDAY THE 13TH to laugh off a spear sticking out of Kevin 
Bacon's chest while blood spurts like crazy, but it's damn hard to sit 
and eat Reese's Pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the 
head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield.</P>
<P>        And believe me, there's plenty of it. A 30-minute sequence at 
the beginning of the movie has an Army captain (Tom Hanks) and his 
soldiers landing at Omaha Beach to join countless other Americans 
who are already under fire. Lives are lost in seconds as the 
purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on, and all the 
young men in the audience find themselves never, ever wanting to be 
drafted.</P>
<P>        Cut to some bureaucratic defense office, where a hundred 
women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the 
casualties. One woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three 
brothers in different platoons were killed in combat, and their mother 
is getting the telegram today. I guess it's an interesting conversation 
piece to everyone but the mother, so the Army chief (Harve Presnell) 
sends Hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission, to find 
the fourth Ryan brother and send him home. That way, the Army 
saves the postage on yet another telegram to Mrs. Ryan.</P>
<P>        One good thing about SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is that the soldiers 
who are headed to rescue Ryan know it's a mission designed to make 
the Army look good. They question the worth of risking eight soldiers' 
lives to save one, and Hanks' character admits he doesn't give a damn 
about Ryan; he's just following orders. If this was a John Wayne 
movie, things would be different. There'd be a phony, "Let's go get that 
boy, gosh darn it!" attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war. By 
doing things this way, Spielberg admits the instincts of self-
preservation and complacency that every normal person has. It makes 
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN a lot more powerful than an testosterone-driven 
Stallone movie mission.</P>
<P>        The movie's pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by 
quiet scenes of semi-introspective conversation among the soldiers. 
Hanks is painted first as a nails-tough Army man careful to hide his 
true self from the other men. It's not that way for long. Edward Burns, 
the guy you get for your movie when Ben Affleck isn't available, is the 
impulsive one. Jeremy Davies plays the translator who is seeing 
combat for the first time, and so on. None of the characters are 
fascinating or natural born heroes, but was Spielberg's obvious 
intention.</P>
<P>        I wondered when I heard SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was three 
hours long, how were they going to fill three hours' time searching for 
one person and still make it interesting? There are a few false starts; 
Hanks finds one Private Ryan in Ted Danson's company (Apparently, 
Danson joined the Army after "Ink" was canceled.) and breaks the bad 
news before learning it's the wrong Ryan. And of course the movie's 
far from over when Hanks does locate Ryan (Matt Damon, the other 
guy you get when Affleck isn't available). That's when the movie turns 
into more of a conventional war flick, although body parts and limbs 
still fly like never before.</P>
<P>        SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is worth your time, but it's definitely no 
SCHINDLER'S LIST. The battle scenes are intense and realistic, but some 
of the attempts at sincere emotion aren't. The movie's bookends are 
particularly cheesy and out of place, when an old Private Ryan goes to 
the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out, whining, "Tell me 
I've led a good life. Tell me I'm a good man." Spielberg was apparently 
following the James Cameron line of thought that any three-hour 
movie about the past should be framed by a self-contained prologue 
and epilogue that takes place in the present.</P>
<P>        Much more effective are subtler scenes, like the one where 
several of Hanks' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead 
soldiers, and they make light of what they're doing by pretending 
they're playing poker. This while an airborne division marches by, 
their eyes full of that mound of dogtags. By not explicitly pointing out 
that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in 
war, the audience gets the message. And even if it's not a classic, 
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is definitely one of the better war movies out 
there.</P>
