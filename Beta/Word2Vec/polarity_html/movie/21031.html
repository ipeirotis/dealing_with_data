<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Obviously there is no such a place as Pleasantville, except in a sitcom.
But Pleasantville the movie and the sitcom in the movie, is made into an
idealized homogenous (all white) illusionary place, where a brother and
sister will be transported into this never-never land of TV fantasy of
the 1950s and 1960s, where everyone is repressed and seen in
black-and-white sitcom form, reminiscent of shows like Father Knows
Best, The Donna Reed Show, and The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet.</P>
<P>Pleasantville is a film about how selective one's memory is when it
comes to nostalgia, of pining for values that never existed back then
but still are the values exemplified for the traditional family, of the
resistance to change, and clashes between those in the film who become
"colored" and those who remain in "black-and-white," and about the need
to be an individual and not conform.</P>
<P>Pleasantville opens in the '90s, where a fast lifestyle and family
dysfunctionality seem to be the norm. Teenagers David (Tobey Maguire)
and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are the twins of a troubled single-
parent (Jane), who is never there for them. At night, with their mom out
on a date, David is all keyed up to watch a marathon of his favorite TV
program, Pleasantville, of which he is an expert on, knowing every
character and minor detail about the show. Meanwhile, Jenn has a heavy
date with a hunk she wants to be romantic with while watching MTV. The
twins end up fighting over the remote for the TV show they want to see
and it breaks apart, but bingo, a TV repairman (Don Knotts) who wasn't
even called by them appears at their door and gives them a new magical
remote (supposedly coming here because of David's true love and
knowledge of the Pleasantville TV show), and with the new remote
switched on, the twins are now trapped in the TV program Pleasantville,
taking the place of the TV siblings Bud and Mary Sue. They are now in a
place where people regularly say swell and keen, the weather is always
perfect at 72 degrees, there is no such thing as rain, no colors
(therefore no discrimination), no sex, no profanity, no fires (firemen
only rescue cats), and everything is just peachy. Their new parents are
the perfect couple George (William H. Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen),
whose idea of marriage revolves around each of them knowing their place-
he works and she stays home with a smile on her face, while kept busy by
cleaning, cooking, and taking care of the children.</P>
<P>David and Jenn have a different outlook on life, with him relating to
the simple existence of Pleasantville and upset that he can't fit in
with the turbulent '90s: he finds it hard to talk to girls his age, in
class he is upset to hear about incurable diseases, ozone depletion, and
a tough job market. While Jenn is content with the "new age" freedom of
the '90s in sex and not interested in anything that is not "cool."</P>
<P>It's fairly predictable what will happen once the two realize that they
are transformed into an unreal TV world, as the film prepares to go into
its satire mold and take apart the blandness of such perfection. David
has no problem getting right into the program, while Jenn calls this
place "Nerdville" and wants out immediately. The calendar permanently
reads 1958, but the two, are stuck with their '90s views on things. At
school everything seems more innocent and less tense, dates take place
over ice cream sodas and cheese burgers, and being pinned means holding
hands not having sex, the basketball team wins every game, and there is
nothing really to learn in school that is perplexing because there is
nothing outside of Pleasantville. But this changes when Jenn asks
questions about what is outside of Pleasantville and takes her boyfriend
to lover's lane for some serious sex. When things change, colors start
to appear, it seems as if Jenn/Mary Sue has begun to upset the universe
for these naive folks.</P>
<P>As expected, the siblings can't help but disrupt this simplistic
community after living in a supposedly more sophisticated time period,
and such things as color, emotions, jealousies, sex, conflicts, makeup
for women, and other changes are now brought into this insular community
like diseases transmitted to the modern world. The filmmaker then
analyzes these changes on those newly affected and the result is a more
troubled but more interesting people emerging. Through special effects
from digital processing, flowers start taking on color and the film
begins to have a modern-day "Alice in Wonderland" look to it.</P>
<P>Jeff Daniels plays the stunted soda shop owner (Mr. Johnson) who makes
Betty sexually aware of herself and who blossoms when Bud/David gives
him art books and he discovers he can paint in colors. The movie makes
the point that the revolutionary changes in the '60s came about when
people became dissatisfied with the staidness of the '50s and began to
experiment and expand their horizons. J.T. Walsh is Big Bob, the mayor
of the town, in an uninspiring role as the most ardent one against
change.</P>
<P>There was something that rubbed me the wrong way about this "cute" idea
of a film, besides the fact it was boring and I felt as if I was being
lectured to about the obvious general ills of society. There are no
radical new ideas presented in this film that will make me really think
about these issues any differently than the films of the 1950s would
have; it is as if the filmmaker is saying that 1950s didn't have films
that were critical of society: but a list of such films would be very
extensive (Marty, High Noon, Ace in the Hole, etc.). This snooty
attitude, looking down at the past from the vantage point of a
supposedly "hip" new age bothered me. Afterall, my impression of this
film, is that it really is a 1950s sitcom merging with a 1990s "feel
good" type of sitcom, and nothing more. It is basically, a gimmicky
film, which is the only new ground it breaks, selling an idea about the
past that connects it with the present, but doing it at the expense of
telling the truth about neither the past or present.</P>
<P>The film presumes that through the efforts of these spoiled teens, that
they will break through the "ignorance is bliss community" and bring
about art and literature and a more enlightened attitude toward sex, and
to inspire a climate for more responsible social changes. The film is
trying to say that the innocence of the 1950s must be merged with the
social awareness of the 1990s and this can only be accomplished by the
teenage heroes, who are not afraid to take chances and change the times
they're in. I just didn't buy into this premise and was not convinced
that I wasn't seeing anything but a superficial film. For instance,
having Jenn/Mary Sue substitute her new ideas of sexual feelings by
reading "Lady Chatterley's Lover" instead of going out with her
boyfriend and having sex, seemed to me to be a phony response to what
literature can offer. Character development is a raising of
consciousness that comes about only through a real inward awareness, a
book can only act as a catalyst for that experience. What is offered
movie-wise, is just the kind of empty gestures made to genuine problems,
which can be found on TV programs from both yesterday and today.
Therefore it is just another empty gesture at culture, trying to be
cute, letting the baby boomers know that it's okay, there're doing just
fine. You can keep being materialists, just be cool about it! And by not
upsetting the apple cart, just railing against the general ills of
society, the filmmaker has succeeded in tapping into a huge audience by
not being probative enough, allowing the film's nostalgia to play for it
rather than to make one really tune into the '90s aspect of the film it
brings up about the real problems this society faces that are not being
met, such as, families in crises situations, environments being raped,
art and literature being more removed from mainstream America than ever
before, schools that can't educate most of their students effectively, a
continuation of bland TV programs (getting more obscene is not
necessarily an advancement), and a society that is confused about the
values it thinks are important. The film has simply lost track of its
critique of society, and has failed to show how one age has evolved from
another, with each age being misled by those trying to force its values
onto another age. There was no one in this film who understood how to
bridge the past with the future, instead this becomes a film just like
the sitcoms it parodies, which means it's just another escape film,
unable or unwilling to delve deeply into all the real problems it brings
up.</P>
