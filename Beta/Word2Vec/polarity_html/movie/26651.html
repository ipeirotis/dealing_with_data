<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The singles scene in Seattle, the reputed java capital of America and
where the grunge rock scene is flourishing, is the setting for this
youth oriented sitcom movie. The film's subject is the search for ideal
love. It is the second feature of writer-director Cameron Crowe (Say
Anything . . .), as it highlights six singles who are aged somewhere in
their twenties, some living in the same apartment complex. It shows
their bitter-sweet relationships at work and at play, with some having
bad reactions to being single even though they are attractive and have
good personalities. They all also have good jobs or  plans to get the
job they want, and have possibilties for some kind of relationship.
Their singles situation is not that desperate.</P>
<P>This fluff film fails to be absorbing because it is so sugary and
forgettable, but with that being said, it still had a few tender moments
that seemed worth while.</P>
<P>The featured couple is Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgwick. He works as a
city planner, trying to promote his idea for a Seattle rapid-transit
system to alleviate traffic congestion, while she works for an
environmental group. These two nice yuppies seem a perfect match, but
the timing of their meeting at a music concert comes at a time when Kyra
was just hurt by a smooth-talking Spaniard university student and
Campbell has had hard luck with his former girlfriends, and they are
both reluctant to trust someone else. There was nothing special about
their up and down relationship, as it was very predictable. When they
get through playing games of showing each other that neither one wants
to be the one getting dumped, they find that they really like each
other.</P>
<P>Bridget Fonda and Matt Dillon are a more interesting pairing. She
aspires to be an architect, but is working as a coffeehouse waitress. He
is the long-haired singer with a punk rock band, who has an inflated
opinion of his singing abilities, which is not shared by the music
critics. He is hoping for a bigger break while he works in the coffee
shop and as a flower deliverer, and his band performs in the local
nightspots. They live in the same apartment complex, and their romance
is one-sided, with Bridget falling head over heel over the self-absorbed
rocker. He takes her love for granted, surrounded by groupies, taking on
the image of a laid-back musician who can get any woman he wants by
being cool and indifferent. When she can't understand why he is not
taken with her, her neighbor Campbell tells her, it is probably because
he likes busty women. She decides to enlarge her breasts, but the
plastic surgeon (Bill Pullman) tells her that her breasts are fine, as
he uses computer-generated graphics to give her a modest breast
enlargement, but she argues for the x-large variety. He finally
convinces her to get her boyfriend to like her the way she is. Their
eventual rekindling of their relationship also moves along predictable
lines, as she mentions she wants a man who will at least say 'God Bless'
you, when she sneezes. By the film's conclusion, after Matt gets to know
what it feels like chasing a girl who ignores him, he comes to his
senses and says the magical words of 'God Bless' you, when she sneezes,
so that they can get together again.</P>
<P>Sheila Kelley's stock character is sketchy and dull, of one who will do
anything to get a man. In her most amusing scene, she decides to go to a
dating service and make a videotape of how she wants to present herself.
The videographer  is "Batman" director Tim Burton. He will produce a
video that is guaranteed to attract the kind of man she is not looking
for, as she changes her hairstyle and wardrobe and winds up with a
completely different look than the real person she is.</P>
<P>The grunge rock scene was fun to watch, the characters were more likable
than not, there was a lot of tenderness shown for those who get hurt in
relationships, and the film is emotionally as sweet as pie. The director
is good at getting at light comedic moments, but has nothing much to say
that is more serious. This is not an engaging film, and its whimsical
story and cliché characters did not hold my interest. The film was just
too mild in attitude and tame in spirit. It is really a youth oriented
film, with trite sayings which sound terribly out of place, such as when
one of the characters says, "Being alone, there is a certain dignity to
it." The film could be best enjoyed for its soundtrack, which includes
the music of Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam in the
background.</P>
