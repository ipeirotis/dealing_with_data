<P>  TEN HUNDRED KINGS (director/writer/editor: D. W. Maze; cinematographer: Nils
Kinisten; editors: Jim Towne/Sabine Hoffman; cast: Elizabeth Marvel (Caroline),
Bill Camp (Paul), Lynn Cohen (Ann Shephard), Malachy McCourt (Fred Shephard),
Adam Lefevre (Frankie); Runtime: 80; Granis; 2001) </P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A brilliant and moving indie drama filmed on a shoestring budget of $400,000,
money allocated from the Actors Guild. It took 28 days to film it in NYC as the
creator of this work, D. W. Maze, used only one take for all his shots in order
to save expenses. It took six months for the film's producer Jim Towne and the
director/writer Maze to edit it, while Sabine Hoffman helped on the editing for
six weeks. Maze mentioned that if he had to do it again, he would use guerrilla
techniques allowing him to have a less glossy look but he would now have the
ability to edit daily and reshoot scenes. As far as I could tell, there is only
the abrupt happy ending I would expand on. Otherwise, the film had an honest
tension to it that made all these one take scenes seem honest, fresh and
gripping. </P>
<P>The film has not been released as of yet, but has been going around to film
festivals. I saw it at the Williamstown Festival. That is the fifth and probably
last festival it will play, as it either must find a distributor after a year of
festivals or risk the possibility of never getting released. The director, a
1994 graduate of Williams College, came from LA to be at the festival, where he
discussed his film afterwards--which justifiably received great audience
acclaim. He mentioned that some cable TV networks might be interested in it if
the nude scenes are removed. This prompted Maze to jest that the film in order
to get a release could be retitled "Blind Babe's Boobs" in imitation of a Hong
Kong film. </P>
<P>The drama centers around a married couple undergoing a strained relationship,
each keeping secrets about themselves. For Paul, his grief has grown ever since
their young son died from a car accident when he took the child to the park.
Caroline Shepard (Marvel) has been blind since childhood. When her mother died
and her alcoholic father couldn't raise her, older brother Frankie did. He has
since become a NYC policeman, but doesn't have the inner strength to look out
for Caroline anymore. She feels she can't turn to him anymore for consolation.
He, also, never liked the smugly intellectual Paul and therefore is not
disturbed that the couple might be separating. Paul Shephard (Camp) is an Ivy
League graduate, an intellectual and a taciturn man who is deeply hurting and
can't communicate anymore with his wife. He once loved her so much that he
volunteered not to go into his chosen profession as a classical scholar, but
instead worked for his father as a housepainter. He did this to earn money to
put his wife through law school, but is now seemingly in a continual dazed state
that he still works as a housepainter. </P>
<P>Paul reacts poorly to his wife telling him in the middle of their sex act, that
she's not enjoying this. He goes for a walk in Central Park, and the surprise is
that he's not about to get mugged when approached by a threatening looking
gang--but that he buys drugs from these thugs. This heroin habit is something
Caroline doesn't know about him. It's an interesting role for Camp, since Maze
mentioned that Camp was a former heroin user (it is one of the reasons he took
the part). Whether it's acting or his life experience speaking, he is very
genuine in this role and draws a very deep picture of someone losing a grip on
himself. He's going through a deep meditation on his life as he brings back
memories from his childhood to the present and how his life has veered off
course because he feels guilty about his son's death and about his love life. </P>
<P>In Caroline's career set in the corporate world she philosophizes that it is
easy for her to compromise some of the things she believes, in order to get what
she wants. It has been her nature to view the world ever since childhood as a
hostile place and she has learned to live by compromise and by being dependent
on others to help her, as her aim is always to carve out for herself as
independent a life as she can. In one shot the screen fades to black as the
viewer sees the world as darkly as she does for the moment, as she asks a
stranger on the platform what subway train has just come into the station. She's
dependent on others giving her the right information, whether on the street or
among the staff at the law firm she works for. It's also revealed that she
married Paul not because she loved him, but because of the stability he offered.</P>
<P>The film looked great because of its photography, its script was well thought
out and intelligently done, and even though the actors were not household names
they were all superb. Marvel is known as an intellectual actress, someone who
usually works in the theater and has garnished Obie awards. Camp was a good
counter-balance to Marvel, as the couple is fighting through their selfish
secret lives, the lies they are insiduously living with, and the real love they
have for each other. Incidentally, Marvel and Camp have a real-life longtime
romantic relationship. </P>
<P>One of the outstanding scenes, was when Camp returns when tipsy to his childhood
home and those awful memories of his childhood come back to haunt him in the
presence of his parents (Lynn Cohen & Malachy McCourt) who don't understand him
and their love seems misdirected. </P>
<P>This is a deeply emotional film with many complex layers to it, it is the kind
of film that Hollywood can't make because they believe there isn't an
intelligent audience out there that want to see films like this one. That is
precisely why such a heavy and intense film like this one, that takes risks and
is unafraid that it does not fit into a niche market, deserves to be critically
recommended so that it gets noticed by some distributor and has the possibility
to reach a demanding audience that craves such worthy films. It is easily one of
the better films I have seen this year. </P>
