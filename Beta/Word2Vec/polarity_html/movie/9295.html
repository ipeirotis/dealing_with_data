<PRE>                               ROCKET MAN
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     If you've seen the trailers for Disney's ROCKET MAN that have been
bombarding the airwaves lately, you've probably reasoned with yourself
that the film cannot possibly be as bad as it looks.  Actually, it's
worse.</P>
<P>     Some movies are so stupid they are good -- the most recent example
being Disney's GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE.  ROCKET MAN, on the other hand,
starring Harland Williams as Pee Herman without the charm, remains
insufferably inane.  If Harland Williams possesses any comedic talent,
it is not in evidence in this lame farce.  Only his imitations of old
movie stars demonstrate any acting ability.</P>
<P>     Harland plays software nerd and would-be astronaut Fred Randall.
As the movie opens, Fred appears as a youngster spinning around in his
mother's dryer.  As he looks out the door's window, he imagines himself
on a mission in space.  (That this might encourage young kids to try
this at home is one of the show's many questionable decisions.)</P>
<P>     As an adult but decidedly not a grown-up, the wild-haired Fred
comes in to help NASA find the problems in the software he designed for
the first manned mission to Mars.  "A glitch?" he says when confronted
with possible bugs in his code.  "That's not possible.  I programmed it
myself."</P>
<P>     Not long after he arrives at the astronaut training center, he is
asked to go on the flight to Mars.  During his training, he manages to
set endurance records for physical strength, all the while almost
killing others with his slapstick klutziness.</P>
<P>     The male astronauts invite Harland over for drinks and get him so
drunk that he does embarrassing things -- although no more so than in
the rest of the story.  The only female astronaut, Julie Ford (Jessica
Lundy), comes over to rescue him.  "I think someone drunk like this is
wrong," she tells her male coworkers.  Again, in a film whose target
audience is young kids, this whole sequence is wrong.</P>
<P>     To be fair, the script by Greg Erb and Craig Mazin would have been
unwatchable with just about any actor playing the lead.  The constant
sight gags include people slipping on vomit, flatulence in a space
suit, snot-encrusted space helmets, and the ubiquitous falling down
routines.</P>
<P>     The one joke that did hit home was Harland's training session on a
gyro-like simulator.  ("Sweet, swirling, onion rings!")  Having passed
on this simulator when my son and I went to space camp last year, I
knew just how he felt.</P>
<P>     "I'm 30-years-old," Harland tells us.  "I'm almost a grown man."
Almost.</P>
<P>     ROCKET MAN runs 1:32, but feels longer.  The show is rated PG for
some of its questionable humor.  The show is targeted at kids under 10,
but consider my warnings about the appropriateness of some of the
scenes.  My son Jeffrey, age 8, said he thought the picture was "really
good," but went on to complain that the film was "a little too stupid
at times."  I hated the movie and can barely give it a single star.  Oh
yes, there is an epilogue at the end of the credits for those of you
who cannot get enough of ROCKET MAN.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
