<PRE>                         JURASSIC PARK III
               (a film review by Mark R. Leeper)</PRE>
<P>    CAPSULE: A short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur 
    films made by Steven Spielberg.  Joe Johnston directs a 
    straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the 
    dinosaurs.  It lets us see some new dinosaurs (is that an 
    oxymoron?) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably 
    written adventure.  The film is neither ambitious nor 
    pretentious.  I had a good time.  Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2 
    (-4 to +4) </P>
<P>Here goes my credibility.  This is a film on which I expect to be 
in a minority.  I liked the third JURASSIC PARK film.  I even 
liked the second JURASSIC PARK film.  In a lot of ways JURASSIC 
PARK: THE LOST WORLD was a creative three-way braiding together of 
Michael Crichton's novel THE LOST WORLD, Arthur Conan Doyle's 
novel THE LOST WORLD, and the classic silent film version of the 
Doyle.  JP2 was an adventure, as Doyle said, "for the boy who's 
half man or the man who's half boy."  That is what all the 
JURASSIC PARK films are.  Expecting them to give the viewer 
insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to 
vacuum your house.  The classic adventure films like GUNGA DIN or 
KING SOLOMON'S MINES had under-written characters also. </P>
<P>JURASSIC PARK III is an all out adventure on an island inhabited 
by dinosaurs.  The characters are a little more complex than they 
at first appear to be, and even that is a little more complex than 
I was expecting.  Some of the characters who start out looking 
stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds.  That 
degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking 
dinosaur effects is just about as much as I require.  I feel I got 
my money's worth. </P>
<P>The story opens with Eric (played by Trevor Morgan) and friend 
parasailing near the forbidden island of Isla Sorna off Costa 
Rica. This was the research island where the dinosaurs were 
created for the now defunct Jurassic Park.  They hope, no doubt, 
to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height.  The 
height is safe, but driving the boat in the water is not.  The two 
soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail 
onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the 
dinosaurs than they had intended. </P>
<P>Flash to the United States and someone is offering to fund 
paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill) in his research if he will 
go and fly over Isla Sorna and act as a guide.  He has said that 
no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real 
dinosaurs.  But again money convinces him to drop what he is doing 
and go.  Doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple 
(William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) who has been just about everywhere 
else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real 
dinosaurs.  They too plan to see the island from a safe height 
Grant is relieved to learn.  He will fly over this island at a 
safe altitude just this once.  Right.  Guess what happens next? </P>
<P>JP3 probably functions better as a sequel than JP2.  First it has 
Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) back rather than the 
much less appealing Ian Malcolm.  Sattler has a much smaller part 
in JP3, but is still present to tie this story to the first.  
Curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene 
with characters holding on to some large metal object that is 
about to fall some great distance. </P>
<P>One thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just 
as Grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other, 
suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time.  They did not 
appear to be conversing in the previous films.  Of course, these 
raptors look a little different also, so perhaps they are a 
different related species.  Not only are they more intelligent 
than in the past films, they are also more sympathetic.  In this 
story they are not just killing machines, they have reasonable 
motives for what they do beyond nutrition.  This time around they 
may be a little too anthropomorphized. </P>
<P>Each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs, 
of course.  In this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus, not 
as common or as popularly known as a Tyrannosaurus, but larger and 
presumably more nasty.  It has a crocodile's head and the body 
that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright. </P>
<P>Perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual 
effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs.  
Sometimes they just move too fast to see.  Occasionally darkness 
or fog obscures our vision.  A few times we get unconvincing matte 
shot, particularly of the laboratory.  But there is less money on 
the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous 
films.  The musical score by Don Davis borrows heavily from John 
Williams's score for the first film.  Joe Johnston, who directs, 
already has to his credit two very good films I recommend THE 
ROCKETEER and OCTOBER SKY.  A team including Alexander Payne and 
Jim Taylor known for ELECTION writes the screenplay.  The film 
they have made is a long way from great cinema, but it still is 
fun.  If you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like 
live dinosaurs alive today, the film is for you.  I rate it a 7 on 
the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale. </P>
