<P>     Brian Levant, director of THE FLINTSTONES IN VIVA ROCK VEGAS (as well
as the 1994 FLINTSTONES feature), says and does everything you'd expect of
a sequel to a film based on a television series. He professes his
affection for the original series, and his desire to remain true to its
spirit. He tosses in touchstones both from the series (the alien Great
Gazoo; Harvey Korman, original Gazoo voice, in the role of Wilma's father) 
and from the first film (Rosie O'Donnell as the voice of an octopus
masseuse). In short, it is Levant's goal to create a thoroughly 
synthesized film experience. If anything in VIVA ROCK VEGAS disrupts the
comfort of the familiar, he has failed.</P>
<P>     That being the case, chalk up VIVA ROCK VEGAS as a smashing success
of the most yawn-inducing sort. The "prequel" story begins with the Great
Gazoo (Alan Cumming) assigned by his race to study the mating habits of
prehistoric earthlings. He lands in Bedrock, where Fred Flintstone (Mark
Addy) and Barney Rubble (Stephen Baldwin) are bachelor pals fresh out of
the Bronto Crane Academy. On a trip to the neighborhood Bronto King, they
meet waitresses Wilma Slaghoople (Kristen Johnston) and Betty O'Shale
(Jane Krakowski), and romance is soon in the air. Little do any of them
know that Wilma is actually a runaway heiress whose would-be fiance Chip
Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson) is sort of a poor loser. Chip invites the
happy couples to his casino in Rock Vegas, where his dastardly plans will
be set in motion.</P>
<P>     It's somehow more depressing when a film like VIVA ROCK VEGAS shows
flashes of genuinely inspired writing, letting you know that those
involved could have done much better if it had mattered at all to them. 
There's a great gag about circus side-show freaks including "a 40-year-old
man," a wonderful ham-fisted compliment with Fred comparing Wilma's eyes
to "two big  eyes" and an addled rock star's vague concern over whether
his female companion is a minor. It's also hard not to get a few giggles
out of Cumming's double-duty as the effete Gazoo and the preening Mick
Jagged. In general, though, the film is content to coast on its special
effects, its insider humor (Ann-Margret, co-star of the Elvis Presley film
VIVA LAS VEGAS, singing the title song) and its bronto-crane-load of
"rock" puns. Handling such a recognizable commodity, Levant sees no need
to rock -- no pun intended -- this particular boat.</P>
<P>     Of course, he has no choice but to deal with a complete overhaul of
the original film's cast. John Goodman gives way to Addy, who's personable
enough and bypasses Alan Reed's Fred entirely to go right to the source
with a decent imitation of Jackie Gleason. The muscular Baldwin isn't
nearly as ideal a Barney as Rick Moranis, nor does Johnston match
Elizabeth Perkins' endearingly flat readings of Wilma's signature "Frad;" 
in neither case does the film waste any time explaining how each one
shrinks several inches by the time the next film rolls around. Only
Krakowski seems more physically right for her part -- God love Rosie
O'Donnell, but she's no wasp-waist -- and her titter is on target. There's
not much one can say to criticize performances like these -- "cartoonish" 
would be a compliment, after all -- but there's not much that 
distinguishes them, either. The actors, like most everything else in the
film, seem set up not to get in the way of the general feeling of good
will.</P>
<P>     Some might argue that a disposable entertainment like VIVA ROCK VEGAS
is nothing more than brightly-colored, slapstick-heavy eye candy for the
kids, and should be treated as such. It might be easier to buy that
reasoning if it didn't take exactly four minutes before the first
flatulence joke, and 15 minutes for the first joke about Fred and Barney
sheepishly denying the appearance of a homosexual relationship. I don't
recall those as the kind of gags typical of the series for which Brian
Levant expresses so much fond remembrance. THE FLINTSTONES IN VIVA ROCK
VEGAS, isolated bursts of genuine humor aside, is a deeply pandering
film. It panders to stereotypes; it panders to the most inane adult
nostalgia; it panders to the most simplistic kiddie humor. That's often
the kind of film you get when your primary goal is the comfort of the
familiar ... in this case, humor that was already tired when dinosaurs
walked the earth.</P>
