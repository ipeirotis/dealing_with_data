<PRE>                             JEFFERSON IN PARIS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Nick Nolte, Greta Scacchi, Thandie Newton, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Seth Gilliam.
Screenplay:  Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.
Director:  James Ivory.</P>
<P>     If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory are not careful, their names
might very well lose their proper noun status.  Like Q-Tip or Xerox,
"Merchant Ivory" is becoming something of a generic term, a
descriptor for intimate period pieces in the tradition of critical
successes like A ROOM WITH A VIEW, HOWARDS END and THE REMAINS OF
THE DAY.  For many moviegoers, though, the term is also used to
evoke images of technically proficient but turgid filmmaking.
Sadly, JEFFERSON IN PARIS is everything their most vocal detractors
have accused Merchant Ivory efforts of being.  There are plenty of
beautiful sets, meaningful glances and profound discussions, but
there isn't a shred of compelling drama to connect them, or a single
key character into whose life we are given any insight.</P>
<P>     JEFFERSON IN PARIS takes place primarily in the years 1784 to
1789, when Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) lived in Paris as American
ambassador to France.  His beloved wife having died, Jefferson
brings the eldest of his three daughters, Patsy (Gwyneth Paltrow),
to stay with him, but otherwise is quite alone.  That changes when
he falls in love with Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi), the English-
Italian wife of English painter Richard Cosway (Simon Callow), but
circumstances frequently conspire to keep them apart.  After the
death of Jefferson's youngest daughter, he summons the remaining
daughter to Paris, along with her slave nurse Sally Hemings (Thandie
Newton).  Although he maintains a correspondence and friendship with
Maria, Jefferson also begins a a secretive relationship with Sally,
while the stirrings of the French Revolution cause turmoil in the
Paris courts.</P>
<P>     There are any number of ways the Merchant Ivory team could have
approached these years in the life of a man of many contradictions.
They could have examined his reactions to the ostentations of the
French court which expedited its downfall in 1789; they could have
explored the reasons why the architect of democracy was also a slave
owner; they could have delved into his troubled personal life.  And
that is precisely what they did, and a dozen other things besides.
This is not a biographical sketch with a point of view.  It's a
series of anecdotes, many of them apocryphal.  Of what particular
relevance, for example, is Jefferson's mission to secure a loan from
the Dutch?  Or a lengthy scene at an opera in which the relationship
between Jefferson and Maria Cosway is not furthered one bit?  Writer
Ruth Prawer Jhabvala is a genius at adapting the narratives of other
writers for the screen, but she does a terrible job of constructing
a narrative from a collection of historical footnotes.  This is
simply EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THOMAS JEFFERSON
BUT WERE AFRAID TO ASK.</P>
<P>     Jhabvala's ability to create characters also deserts her,
leaving JEFFERSON IN PARIS filled with incomplete sketches.  Gwyneth
Paltrow (FLESH AND BONE) has the most interesting part as Patsy
Jefferson, the troubled girl who feels abandoned by her father's
daliance with Sally, but there are significant gaps left in her
character as well (notably her reaction to Jefferson's refusal to
allow her conversion to Catholicism).  Greta Scacchi and Thandie
Newton are both under-developed as the women in Jefferson's life,
and his attraction to Maria in particular makes no sense based on
their interaction.  But that is part of the greatest disaster, Nick
Nolte's stiff Thomas Jefferson.  It is an awful performance of a
character with tremendous potential, and the script never even
bothers to try to get inside his head.  I felt I had a better
understanding of Jefferson from staring at Mount Rushmore.</P>
<P>     Ivory does deliver some finely crafted scenes, of course, such
as Louis XVI learning about the revolution while on a hunt, and
Richard Robbins' score and Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography are
characteristically superb.  Unfortunately, the way Ivory frames the
story (beginning with a flashback featuring James Earl Jones as the
son of Jefferson and Sally Hemings telling the story to a reporter)
makes the failings of JEFFERSON IN PARIS all the more evident.  It
isn't about the scandalous, if historically questionable, notion
that Jefferson fathered children by one of his slaves.  It isn't
really *about* anything.  Like the worst high school history
textbooks, it just starts in one place and ends in another, and all
you really want to do is look at the pictures.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 floundering fathers:  3.</PRE>
