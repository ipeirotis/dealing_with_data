<P>PLOT:
Two teen couples go to a church party, drink and then drive. They get into an
accident. One of the guys dies, but his girlfriend continues to see him in her
life, and has nightmares. What's the deal? Watch the movie and "sorta" find
out...</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea, but
presents it in a very bad package. Which is what makes this review an even
harder one to write, since I generally applaud films which attempt to break the
mold, mess with your head and such (LOST HIGHWAY & MEMENTO), but there are good
and bad ways of making all types of films, and these folks just didn't snag this
one correctly. They seem to have taken this pretty neat concept, but executed it
terribly. So what are the problems with the movie? Well, its main problem is
that it's simply too jumbled. It starts off "normal" but then downshifts into
this "fantasy" world in which you, as an audience member, have no idea what's
going on. There are dreams, there are characters coming back from the dead,
there are others who look like the dead, there are strange apparitions, there
are disappearances, there are a looooot of chase scenes, there are tons of weird
things that happen, and most of it is simply not explained. Now I personally
don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then, but when all it does is
give me the same clue over and over again, I get kind of fed up after a while,
which is this film's biggest problem. It's obviously got this big secret to
hide, but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes.
And do they make things entertaining, thrilling or even engaging, in the
meantime? Not really.</P>
<P>The sad part is that the Arrow and I both dig on flicks like this, so we
actually figured most of it out by the half-way point, so all of the strangeness
after that did start to make a little bit of sense, but it still didn't the make
the film all that more entertaining. I guess the bottom line with movies like
this is that you should always make sure that the audience is "into it" even
before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding.
I mean, showing Melissa Sagemiller running away from visions for about 20
minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy!! Okay, we get it...there are
people chasing her and we don't know who they are. Do we really need to see it
over and over again? How about giving us different scenes offering further
insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie? Apparently, the
studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves, and
it shows. There might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here
somewhere, but I guess "the suits" decided that turning it into a music video
with little edge, would make more sense. The actors are pretty good for the most
part, although Wes Bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character
that he did in AMERICAN BEAUTY, only in a new neighborhood. But my biggest kudos
go out to Sagemiller, who holds her own throughout the entire film, and actually
has you feeling her character's unraveling.</P>
<P>Overall, the film doesn't stick because it doesn't entertain, it's confusing, it
rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime, despite a
pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it.
Oh, and by the way, this is not a horror or teen slasher flick...it's just
packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre
is still hot with the kids. It also wrapped production two years ago and has
been sitting on the shelves ever since. Whatever...skip it!</P>
