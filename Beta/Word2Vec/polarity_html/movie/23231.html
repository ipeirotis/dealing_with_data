<P>Director: Paul Thomas Anderson
Cast: Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Robards,
Willim H. Macy, Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, Phillip Baker Hall,
Jeremy Blackman </P>
<P>Magnolia left me relling from the theatre, staggering from the
relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft. At
nearly three and a half hours, Magnolia will strike some as a brute of a
film. It not only demands your attention, but challenges you to grasp
the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden
intentions. It is delirious, depressing, heady, pretentious, surreal
filmmaking. It's also a movie that will polarize its viewers.</P>
<P>Director Paul Thomas Anderson takes a talented cast, wraps them in a net
of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair
whose song doesn't let up until an oddly exhilerating, biblically
influenced pseudo-climax. The character's make up a modern day Gomorrah
in the soulless way in which they live their lives. There is Frank
Mackey (Tom Cruise), a slithery snake charmer of men whose "Search and
Destroy" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her
pants. There is Earl Partridge (Jason Robards), a dying media tycoon
yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his
estranged son. There is game show host Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall),
a self absorbed TV icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his
public. And there is police officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly), who
cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal
system, perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision
making process.</P>
<P>Given equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple
(Melora Walters), a former TV quiz show champion (William H. Macy). a
materialistic, adulterous wife (Julianne Moore), a child (Jeremy
Blackman) victimized by a mentally abusive parent, and a caring,
empathetic nurse (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Hovering over all these
characters is a cloud of death, lies and despair. It is not a pleasant
movie.</P>
<P>There is not one bad note in the acting. It is affecting and layered and
wonderful. There is a moment where Tom Cruise wordlessly implodes that
rivals work he has done in whole films. Then he tops himself with a
mesmerizing deathbed scene. Walters plays her character with red-eyed
rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing.
Robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man, who still hears
a lion's roar when he speaks. Director Anderson has apparently given the
actors lattitude to emote. The problem is that he stays on them too
long. Julianne Moore's character, Linda, quickly escalates to a frenzied
pitch of guilt, tears, screaming and remorse and never backs  off from
it. After a few hours, it turns from interesting to chinese water
torture. Quite a few scenes, such as the game show, go on just a bit too
long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film
where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed
it the first go around.</P>
<P>And just what is the theme? Alienation? Hopelessness? Anderson
challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn't make it easy.
The film starts by showing three, strange and seemingly unrelated
events. It's a harbinger of the synchronicity to come. At times,
different stories reach reach key moments at the same time. Other times,
stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory, regardless of what
else is happening. Anderson is audacious enough to even have a group
sing in the middle of the film! What's surprising is that it mostly
works. If you have doubts about Anderson's intentions, I'll ask you to
pay attention to the final frame. Despite all the Sturm und Drang,
Magnolia ultimately speaks to man's capacity for hope and attempts at
redemption.</P>
<P>Despite Magnolia's needlessly long running time and its propensity for
uneven editing as Anderson plays the auteur, showing off fro the masses,
I have to admire his guts. This is truly adventurous filmmaking that
spits in the face of conventional storytelling.</P>
<P>My rating: A Bulleye. (4 out of 4 stars)</P>
<P>A side note: Helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack
featuring Aimee Mann. Her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically
while the actual music is both morose and beautiful. When she sings
"Save Me" at the end, it enhances the yearning felt by the characters,
just as "Wise Up" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate
their lives.</P>
