<P>Deconstructing:  To write about or analyze in a way that questions 
traditional assumptions about certainty, identity, and truth, asserts 
that words can only refer to other words, and attempts to demonstrate 
how statements about any text subvert their own meanings. (The American 
Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition)</P>
<P>     How much of Woody Allen is there in Harry Block?  This is 
undoubtedly one of the questions likely to be foremost in any viewer's 
mind after watching Allen's 1997 feature, DECONSTRUCTING HARRY.  It's 
also the question most often asked of the director in interviews about 
the film.  Allen has been understandably evasive, stating repeatedly 
that, while there may be some similarities between Harry and himself, 
the movie is a work of fiction and Harry is nothing more than a 
character.</P>
<P>     Of course, it could be argued that artists, regardless of whether 
they're authors, painters, or movie directors, aren't always aware of 
the full ramifications of what they create.  It seems clear that Allen 
is doing a little more with DECONSTRUCTING HARRY than simply telling a 
funny story.  But is he using Harry Block as a means to work through 
some personal demons, in a form of on-screen therapy?  Or is this a 
none-too-subtle jab at all the critics who want to inextricably entwine 
Allen's real life with his reel life?  The truth is, it's probably a 
little of both.  If DECONSTRUCTING HARRY has an overriding theme, it's 
that the man and the artist can be separated, and, even if the man is a 
despicable person, his art can redeem him.</P>
<P>     Of course, this makes DECONSTRUCTING HARRY sound like a deeply 
philosophical movie, which it isn't, and the seemingly-pretentious title 
only adds to the confusion.  But the film is appropriately named.  
DECONSTRUCTING HARRY doesn't tell a straightforward or linear story.  
Instead, it uses a fairly unremarkable plot as a springboard for comic 
vignettes that gradually answer questions about Harry's identity.  Like 
the layers of an onion, the folds of his life, both as told through 
"true" flashbacks and "fictionalized" accounts, are peeled away, 
offering a clear picture of the man -- and it's not a pretty one.</P>
<P>     So who is Harry Block?  He is, by some accounts, one of the most 
unpleasant men alive.  Since he's played by Woody Allen, he's also an 
insecure and self-absorbed individual, as well.  (Has there ever been an 
Allen character who wasn't a poorly-adjusted neurotic?)  Professionally, 
he's a world-famous, bestselling author who writes thinly-veiled 
autobiographical tales about his relationships with his three ex-wives.  
Personally, he's a wretch -- a pill-popping, alcoholic lout who has few 
friends and can't stay faithful to one woman.  By his own admission, he 
hasn't grown up, is a failure at life, has no soul, and is a self-hating 
Jew.  According to another character, the whole purpose of his life is 
"sarcasm and orgasm."  He's thoroughly dislikable, and one of the film's 
failings is that it occasionally tries (unsuccessfully) to sympathize 
with him.  Harry is best viewed from a distance.</P>
<P>     Ostensibly, the film is about Harry's trip to upstate New York, 
where a college that expelled him as an undergraduate now wants to honor 
him as a distinguished alumnist.  At the same time, he's looking to 
overcome a severe case of writer's block.  Along with Cookie (Hazelle 
Goodman), a hooker he hired for the day; Richard (Bob Balaban), a friend 
with a bad heart; and Hilly (Eric Lloyd), his son, Harry heads north.  
Along the way, we get to know him through both flashbacks of events from 
his life and anecdotes from his books, which are really just different 
flashbacks with other actors playing identical parts.  For example, Demi 
Moore plays Harry's second wife in the excerpts from his novels, while 
Kirstie Alley plays the same character in "real life".  Harry even has 
two fictional stand-ins for himself, played by Richard Benjamin and 
Stanley Tucci.</P>
<P>     All this might sound confusing, but it's really not.  Allen's 
script isn't linear, but it isn't difficult to piece together.  The 
intent is to amuse, not to confuse.  However, aside from piquing the 
viewer's curiosity about how much of Allen is in Harry, there's not a 
whole lot of depth to DECONSTRUCTING HARRY.  It's a movie of moments, 
some of which are side-splittingly funny.  Arguably, this is the most 
uproarious comedy that Allen has ever done.  The dialogue is almost 
always as brilliant and witty as it is profane.  There are as many 
genuinely funny one-liners here as in any other movie this year.  I 
won't go into detail describing my favorite scenes, but one offers a 
visit from Death, another includes an elevator ride into Hell (where the 
women are topless, the band plays "Sing Sing Sing (with a Swing)", and 
Billy Crystal runs the place), and a third features a blind grandmother. 
Then there's Robin Williams, who, in a cameo, has never been so 
delightfully out of focus.</P>
<P>     DECONSTRUCTING HARRY is an uneven piece of work, but the high level 
of comedy covers up many of the rough spots.  Allen fans won't confuse 
this latest outing with the likes of THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, ANNIE 
HALL, or CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, but it's good to know that the 
director can still poke fun at himself, despite his tarnished image.  We 
may never know how much of this film is pure fiction and how much is 
self-analysis, but one thing is for sure -- once the laughter has 
subsided and the end credits have rolled, audience members will begin 
deconstructing Woody.</P>
