                        That Thing You Do (1996)
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     For those of us like this critic who were teenagers in the 60s,
there is no simpler pleasure that a trip down memory lane.  Musically
in the 60s one group dominated and that was the Beatles.  Girls swooned
in their presence.  I remember driving over to Dallas to see a bunch of
them camping out over night to get tickets for one of their concerts.
I liked the group, but calculated that the Beatles were not worth
sleeping on the ground.</P>
<P>     In his directorial and screenwriting debut, Tom Hanks recreates
the energy and charm of that era through the dramatic assent of an
American group with many similarities to the Beatles's career path.
The group known as the One-ders, and later as the Wonders when no one
realizes that they are supposed to be pronounced the same, is
discovered in an out of the way town in Pennsylvania.  Their fame comes
from a single song and that is also the title for the picture, THAT
THING YOU DO.</P>
<P>     In the Wonders is a singer named James "Jimmy" Mattingly II
(Jonathan Schaech), a guitarist named Lenny Haise (Steve Zahn), a guy
known only as "the bass player" (Ethan Embry), and the catalyst for the
group, a drummer named Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott).  Its one
groupie and Jimmy's girlfriend Faye Dolan (Liv Tyler) is later
christened their costume mistress so she can travel with them
everywhere.</P>
<P>     Just like you need to test a cleaner on a part of a garment to see
if it is safe before you apply it everywhere on it, let me suggest a
warning label for this film.  Listen to the song, "That Thing You Do"
before you see the movie.  You have probably already heard it in the
trailers or in the television advertisements.  If you find the song
irritating in small doses, do enter the theater playing the movie
version.  I counted them, and the song is done eleven times in the
film.  Now, I found the song upbeat and quite nice, but if you don't
like it, this picture will likely drive you crazy.</P>
<P>     The story is that the Wonders wins a contest with their song and
soon are asked to play a gig at the local pizza parlor.  The parlor
owner packs the house so he starts laying money down for them on the
bar saying, "You know what that is?"  The groups comedian, Lenny, says,
"Presidential flashcards?"  The owner answers with "a bonus."</P>
<P>     One day a guy looking like a hunter comes to town and invites them
into his old camper to sign a contract, but one of the group objects
saying he doesn't want to sign away his music.  Lenny gets upset and
says, "Are you crazy?  A man in a really nice camper wants to put our
songs on the radio."</P>
<P>     Soon Tom Hanks enters the picture playing Mr. White, an agent of
the famous Play-Tone records.  He promises the group that they will be
"one of the stars of the Play-Tone galaxy."  He becomes their agent and
mentor, but not their friend.  It is strictly business.  In one scene
he tells Jimmy that he is the boss and, "I don't want any of this
lover's lament crap.  I want something upbeat, something snappy."</P>
<P>     The group has great fun being one of those Play-Tone stars and
traveling with the other luminaries to state fairs.  While their record
is climbing the charts, the other star's careers are in steep descent;
nevertheless, the Wonders are in awe of them and treat them as
demigods.  This part of the show is quite cute and is complete with
go-go dancers in halter tops and skin tight polyester pants behind the
groups.  The costumes by Colleen Atwood (LITTLE WOMEN and PHILADELPHIA)
add to the show without overpowering it.  Similarly, the warm, almost
candlelit affect of the cinematography of Tak Fujimoto (THE SILENCE OF
THE LAMBS and SOMETHING WILD) give the picture a heavily nostalgic
feel.</P>
<P>     The show is almost non-stop music.  Although most of it is the
incessant playing of "That Thing You Do," the falling stars play other
songs as do some jazz groups.  The film is a musical feast albeit a
highly repetitive one.  It all makes for a high energy production and a
pleasant time at the movies.  Watch the credits at the end and count
how many of the songs were written by Tom Hanks.  I think it is about a
dozen.</P>
<P>     The acting by the group of unknowns playing the Wonders are all
nice, but none are particularly noteworthy.  Liv Tyler, on the other
hand, continues in the great tradition of STEALING BEAUTY from earlier
this year.  She spends most of her time looking beautiful with an empty
smile.  For variety, she sometimes changes to an equally meaningless
frown.  Her acting ability must be one of the better kept secrets in
Hollywood.</P>
<P>     THAT THING YOU DO is a fun movie of no consequence.  Other than
the theme song it brainwashes you with, the show has nothing memorable.
For the time you are there, it will be a completely pleasant
experience.  You will likely leave the theater feeling happy for no
particular reason.  I defy you to get that song out of your brain.  It
is stuck there forever I'm afraid.  Oh well, it sure beats those songs
from cigarette commercials that I have never been able to purge.</P>
<P>     THAT THING YOU DO runs a quick 1:50.  Amazingly, it is correctly
rated just PG.  There is no sex, nudity, violence, bad language, or
drug usage.  With most other writers there would have been profanity,
and probably a little dope smoking to show how cool the band was and
how much like the Beatles.  I appreciate Hanks's restraint.  The show
will probably only interest kids nine and up, but there is nothing to
offend or scare kids of any age.  I had nice time so I give the show a
thumbs up and award it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
