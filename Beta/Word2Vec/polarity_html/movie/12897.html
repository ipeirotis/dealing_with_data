<P>     When it comes to movies, there are two things that the early-to-
mid-1980s are best known for:  slasher films and teen comedies.  While 
the former category was hard-pressed to give birth to a vaguely 
watchable entry, quality was widely variable in the latter, spanning the 
spectrum from the dregs of PORKY's to the top-notch entertainment of 
FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH.  One of the most consistent 
writer/directors to contribute to the '80s teen fad was John Hughes (the 
man who would later scale the heights of box-office prosperity with HOME 
ALONE).  In one way or another, Hughes was responsible for the likes of 
SIXTEEN CANDLES, PRETTY IN PINK, SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL, FERRIS 
BUELLER'S DAY OFF, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  While all of those films 
were a cut above the sex and booze-drenched antics of most teen 
comedies, THE BREAKFAST CLUB was arguably the most insightful and 
emotionally-true of them.</P>
<P>     THE BREAKFAST CLUB is very different from almost every other entry 
into what was (at the time) a burgeoning genre.  Instead of relying on 
the staples of bare flesh, crass humor, and brainless plots, this movie 
focuses on five dissimilar characters, is almost entirely dialogue-
driven, and doesn't offer even a glimpse of a breast or buttock.  It's a 
story about communication gaps, teen isolation, and the angst that 
everyone (regardless of how self-assured they seem) experiences during 
the years that function as a transition from the freedom of adolescence 
to the responsibilities of adulthood.</P>
<P>     Even though the premise sounds a little dry, THE BREAKFAST CLUB is 
eminently watchable and consistently entertaining, even when it falters.  
Perhaps aware that his primary audience would be the 14-to-18 year-old 
crowd, Hughes added several surreal and silly sequences to interrupt the 
predominantly serious tone that suffuses the proceedings.  These don't 
really work, but the shift in tone isn't sufficiently glaring to disturb 
the movie's overall flow.</P>
<P>     The Breakfast Club is a small group of high school students, who, 
during the course of a nine-hour Saturday detention, are transformed 
from complete strangers to confidantes.  For each of them, it is an 
unforgettable day, and, while the friendships they form between 7 am and 
4 pm may disintegrate once they get back into the real world, feelings 
are explored and emotions unearthed that give them insights into their 
own lives and the forces that drive the others.  These are the kinds of 
realizations which, if more high school students understood them, might 
make grades nine through twelve a little less traumatic.</P>
<P>     The characters trapped in detention are all very different 
individuals.  Hughes sets them up as traditional stereotypes, then 
delights in slowly peeling back the layers, showing how each suffers 
from surprisingly similar problems.  There's the jock, wrestling star 
Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez); the most popular girl in school, Claire 
Standish (Molly Ringwald); the all-brains, no-brawn geek, Brian Johnson 
(Anthony Michael Hall); the rebel without a cause, John Bender (Judd 
Nelson); and the outcast, Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy).  It turns out 
that none of them communicates well with their parents, all are under 
tremendous pressure from their peers, and each is beset by angst about 
the future.  Pretty obvious observations, right?  Yet few films before 
or after have dealt with these issues as intelligently as THE BREAKFAST 
CLUB.</P>
<P>     Another traditional Hughes theme can be seen running throughout the 
entire film:  the basic intolerance and stupidity of adults.  This is 
evident in several ways, from the obvious (a nasty teacher, played by 
Paul Gleason, who revels in his power) to the subtle (the children 
dreading the possibility that they might grow up to become like their 
parents).  The over-25 crowd rarely fares well in Hughes movies, and 
this is no exception, but there is a scene in THE BREAKFAST CLUB which 
attempts (with limited success) to partially humanize The Authority 
Figure.</P>
<P>     Hughes has assembled a unique and singularly effective cast.  
Emilio Estevez, although a little too old to play a high school teenager 
(he was 22 at the time of filming), does a good job presenting the human 
side of the athlete on a pedestal.  Judd Nelson, also a little on the 
old side (age 24), is believable as the James Dean-type who is looking 
for some kind of acceptance and uses his pugnaciousness as a defense 
mechanism.  Molly Ringwald, the star of three Hughes films (the other 
two being SIXTEEN CANDLES and PRETTY IN PINK), gives the strongest 
performance by showing the ugly, shallow side of being Ms. Popularity.  
Ally Sheedy is suitably weird as a compulsive liar and thief who takes a 
long time to open up.  Anthony Michael Hall looks the part of the geek, 
but, of the five lead actors, his is the least impressive portrayal; 
Brian has trouble escaping from the stereotypical sinkhole in which he 
begins the movie.</P>
<P>     Few will argue that THE BREAKFAST CLUB is a great film, but it has 
a candor that is unexpected and refreshing in a sea of too-often generic 
teen-themed films.  The material is a little talky (albeit not in a way 
that will cause anyone to confuse it with something by Eric Rohmer), but 
it's hard not to be drawn into the world of these characters.  The 
depiction of high school is evocative because it's so accurate (an 
actual suburban Illinois high school was used as the filming location).  
Unlike many teen films, which seem to transpire in some kid's dirty 
imagination, this picture, despite its occasional flights of fancy, is 
grounded in reality.  In THE BREAKFAST CLUB, Hughes has created a 
surprisingly enduring motion picture that is still effective 13 years 
after its theatrical debut.</P>
