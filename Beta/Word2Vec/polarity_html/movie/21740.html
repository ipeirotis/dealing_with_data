<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>There must be some unwritten rule that states, one gets enlightenment
not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment
given to seeking wisdom, even if it is a foolish road one is on and it
seems to be leading nowhere. In the exotic Morocco of 1972, a
25-year-old English hippie mother, Julia (Winslet), of two sweet young
girls, the 6-year-old Lucy (Carrie) and the 8-year-old Bea (Bella), has
arrived for a year's stay, with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to
how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while
she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband
(she is not officially married to him) and her cold one-room London
flat, and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate
of Marrakech. At least she says she is, as she is making some attempt to
contact a Sufi sheikh there who has all the answers. She has not planned
things out too carefully, having no money, and the trip doesn't seem
like it's much fun, more like a misadventure, with some romance with a
local Moroccan thrown in.</P>
<P>Drugs, a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period, where many
Westerners came to Morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to
live the 'good life' cheaply, and to be in a spot where they did not
have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities, even though
drugs are illegal there. But this is not shown as one of her reasons for
being here. In this film, the subject of drugs is never broached, only
hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way, as the hippie commune is
shown in a negative light, strumming on their guitars and bragging about
the hits of acid they have taken. Even the ones coming here for
spiritual reasons, to follow the mystical Sufis, seem lost following a
culture that is far different from where they were coming from.</P>
<P>The film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical
experiences of Sigmund Freud's grand-daughter, Esther Freud, who
traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister. It is written by
the director's brother, who has previously directed Regeneration, The
Playboys, and Trojan Eddie.</P>
<P>The title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying
hideous kinky gives the little girls.</P>
<P>With Julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her
husband often forgets to send her, she is prevented from seeing the
greatest living Sufi who is located in Algeria; so instead, she meets an
acrobat street performer in the bazaar, Bilal (Said Taghmaoui). He
becomes her lover, taking the place of her husband as a father figure
for the girls. The girls readily accept him, and there is no big-to-do
made about their openly sexual relationship, but the girls really don't
know what to make of the relationship. It especially bothers Bea, who is
embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home. Things
go surprisingly sour when Bilal takes them to stay in his small village.
It seems only that Bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness, as he
has a wife who still lives there. This scene didn't make too much sense
as to why he would take them there knowing the situation, unless the
uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people,
also. But I doubt that.</P>
<P>The family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to
decide what to do next, as they hitch a ride away from there with a
truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel.
Lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel, while
Bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal'
girl.</P>
<P>The beauty of Marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of Kate
Winslet, as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its
bustling street scenes, expansive views, illustrious mosques, and grand
sunsets. Kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a Westerner,
living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her
sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the
better off for her experiences, as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do
after their stay ran out of money and purpose.</P>
<P>The background music from groups like America and Jefferson Airplane,
provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp
film. The only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be
permanently harmed while on this sojourn, a venture that should be
reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there
for themselves.</P>
<P>The family's travel, which is on the edge, has Julia waking up screaming
from dreams that are bleakly haunting; but, when she gets up, all there
is, is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is
starting to bother her. That Marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that
London is old hat to her, is starting to wear thin in her thoughts. It
will dawn on her, when Bea takes ill, as she reflects on what the Sufi
guru tells her, whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his
presence. He is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who
died before she got a chance to see him. The new guru is grounded in
reality, something she is not grounded in, and seems to tell her what
she couldn't comprehend from anyone else, even comforting her, by
telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from God.</P>
<P>The film's weakness was the empty feeling I got from watching the story
unfold in its risk free tenor (she was there basically to be just
escaping from her situation) and how unappealing the love affair seemed
between Bilal and Julia. The storyline about a helpless single parent,
detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom
generation had during their trip to Morocco, who were taken in by the
mystical culture of Sufism, a teaching that has a lot to offer its
followers, contrary to the impression the film might give, seemed to
pass her by. Her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep, at best.
She perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along,
smoking some hashish, and have been less assured of herself but to have
behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the
time and had some fun on her journey. After all, the mystical trip is
the journey.</P>
<P>The film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they
are, and no one is that good or that bad, or judged too harshly for
their shortcomings. Bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity.
The little girls are precocious but they are lovable. Julia, the
cornerstone the film is built on, is a mother who cares about the
children but doesn't know how to take care of them without
unintentionally harming them. She was trying to escape from reality and
that by returning to London, she has another chance to see if she can
find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and
should no longer have nightmares about where she's at. This is a very
Freudian way to look at things, as this sudden realization, that things
are not right puts an an end to her Eastern hippie odyssey, at least,
for the time being. And, after all is said and done, who's to say if the
children are also not better off for surviving their experiences, just
like she probably was!</P>
