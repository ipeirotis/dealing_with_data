<P>     I'd like to say that BULWORTH is the best political satire in 
years, but the truth is that is has tough competition from Barry 
Levinson's corrosive WAG THE DOG in that department.  Both films succeed 
admirably, but, although each takes aim at the sorry state of current-
day politics, they have slightly different agendas and approaches.  WAG 
THE DOG dissects the showmanship aspect of Washington, while 
simultaneously firing a few shots at Hollywood.  BULWORTH, on the other 
hand, is a full-frontal assault on the shallowness of the political 
campaign process.  It has the audacity that PRIMARY COLORS should have 
displayed, but was afraid to.  BULWORTH is willing to openly offend to 
get its point across.  That's something that PRIMARY COLORS was nervous 
about doing.</P>
<P>     In one sense, the film, put out by Warren Beatty with little 
concern for whose toes might get stepped on, can be summed up as an 
attack on the growing conservatism of the Democratic party, which is 
becoming increasingly more difficult to distinguish from its Republican 
rival.  BULWORTH is unrepentantly cynical in its view that all 
politicians are in the back pockets of big business and that every 
elected official, whether Democrat or Republican, is a member of an 
exclusive club.  Hypocrisy, self-interest, and greed are the three 
forces that drive every campaign, and Senator Jay Billington Bulworth 
(Beatty) has had enough.</P>
<P>     It's mid-March 1996, and Bulworth, an incumbent Senator from 
California, is running for re-election.  However, like the Michael 
Douglas character in FALLING DOWN, he has reached the breaking point.  
After taking out a $10 million life insurance policy with his 17-year 
old daughter as the sole beneficiary, he puts out a contract on his own 
life, then goes on the warpath against special interest groups.  
Discarding a prepared speech about the country standing "on the doorstep 
of a new millennium," he tells an African-American audience that the 
government doesn't care about them because they don't contribute enough 
money to re-election campaigns.  Later, at a black tie dinner attended 
by Hollywood types, he launches into a tirade about the poor quality of 
movies.  To a mostly-Jewish crowd, he declares, "My guys are not stupid.  
They always put the big Jews on my schedule."  Suddenly, Bulworth's 
"tell it like it is" philosophy is a national sensation, attracting the 
attention of millions, including a young black woman named Nina (Halle 
Berry), who is determined to show the Senator what life is like for 
those who live in South Central L.A.  Right in the middle of everything, 
Bulworth suddenly decides that he wants to live, but learns that calling 
off a hit isn't as easy as setting one up.</P>
<P>     BULWORTH's only real weakness (and it's more in the nature of a 
minor inconvenience than a significant flaw) is the backstory, which, 
with its disguised hit men, car chases, and bungled assassination 
attempts, takes up a little too much time.  The political satire, on the 
other hand, is brilliant.  Not only is it honed to a viciously sharp 
edge, but it's frequently hilarious.  Beatty manages to lampoon 
controversial issues, like kids selling drugs for dealers because 
they're too young to go to prison, while simultaneously making serious 
points.  In addition to the political material, there are other targets, 
including the easy marks of tabloid reporters and TV news programs.  
There's also a funny bit involving George Hamilton.</P>
<P>     Beatty has assembled a solid, diverse cast.  As the title figure, 
the co-writer/director sets himself up as a sitting duck.  Beatty is 
tremendous in this role, even going so far as to poke fun at how his 
increasing age has affected his legendary sex appeal.  He takes Bulworth 
from business suits to sweatpants and sunglasses, and transforms his 
campaign speeches into angry rap songs, all without missing a beat.  
Bulworth may not always be a three-dimensional character, but he's 
consistently fun and completely unpredictable.  The supporting players 
include Oliver Platt as Bulworth's campaign manager, Paul Sorvino as the 
head of an insurance corporation that wants Bulworth to stall a bill in 
committee, Don Cheadle as a drug dealer, and black playwright Amiri 
Baraka as a mysterious homeless man.  </P>
<P>     BULWORTH is an angry movie, but Beatty is savvy enough to recognize 
that people respond better to comedies than serious "issue films," so he 
has camouflaged his message beneath the surface of this original, 
incisive satire.  Like WAG THE DOG and PRIMARY COLORS, BULWORTH may not 
have widespread mainstream appeal, but anyone with an interest in 
American politics should see this movie, not only because it promises to 
tickle the funny bone, but because so many of its shots hit the bulls-
eye.  It's worth noting that BULWORTH occasionally reminded me of 
NETWORK, Sidney Lumet's 1976 shredding of the TV news industry, both in 
terms of plot points and spirit.  Each movie has a take-no-prisoners 
attitude, and in today's climate of suffocating political correctness, 
that's a welcome trait.</P>
