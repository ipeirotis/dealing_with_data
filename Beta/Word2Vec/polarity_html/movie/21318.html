<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This film's narrative promises much to say about how violent man is, as
it uses contemporary L.A. for its location. But in the end, it fails to
deliver the goods; for reasons that are not artistically clear to me,
Wenders decides to abruptly check out of this slow developing non-story
and end it without resolving it satisfactorily. The film seemed to be
oozing completely out of energy and purpose. It made me wonder why
Wenders seemed to be so concerned in the first place with the
socio-political manifestations of a top-secret government project gone
awry and the public being exploited by Hollywood; and then, he
concentrated for most of the film on the usual crime stuff of murder and
missing persons, basically ignoring what he tried so hard to bring to
center stage.</P>
<P>I have always found Wenders to be a bit pretentious; and, at the same
time, alluring. He always seems to bait me into thinking there is
something more to his films than there are. There are exceptions, like
his wonderful film WINGS OF DESIRE, but most of the time I  feel that I
am being intellectually short-changed by such deceptions.This picture is
a perfect example of what I mean.</P>
<P>At first, the story appears to be about Mike Max (Pullman). He plays
this bastard Hollywood movie producer who has gotten wealthy making
exploitive action films and who it seems can't communicate with his fine
looking but empty wife Paige (Andie); he can only communicate
bottom-lines, and is hooked on cellular phones and on computers.</P>
<P>His wife is leaving him because he either constantly ignores her or
dumps on her. Then, the main event of the film takes place, as we
observe on video surveillance, in an observatory with telescopes and
computers and video cameras, that Ray Bering (Gabriel Byrne), who is a
computer expert, is watching two hitmen trying to kill Mike after
kidnapping him. Instead, they end-up dead; and, Mike is found by some
Mexican gardeners as he wanders along the road. He will now live with
them, that is, after telling them he is the famous producer they see on
the news, but is now considered to be a missing person... !</P>
<P>The action turns to following the life of Cat (Traci) who is the stunt
woman Mike gave a big break to, giving her a starring role in his next
film.The cop, Doc Block (Loren), who is investigating the disappearance
of Mike, is suspiciously pulled off the case when he starts asking too
many questions around the set, but stays around long enough to fall for
Cat and  continue the investigation on his own.</P>
<P>The detective's investigation reveals that the video surveillance was a
government plan used to spy on people to cut down on the police response
times to crime; and Byrne, the computer security expert who is setting
this up for the government, is afraid of its inherent dangers, such as
the abuse of power this technology has for society. He has picked Mike,
after just meeting him once at a computer convention in Las Vegas, to
tell him about this classified project. So, it seems that our government
boys are now going after Mike, and Mike tells this to Cat, who tells
this to Doc Block...The most interesting and diverting scenes in this
part of the film concern the poetry performance readings that some of
the movie folks attend. One of the readings is more powerful than
anything that has to do with the story being told. A black woman poet
(Parker) does a poem about being taken sexually by her father.This is
Wenders being the arty Wenders, creating interest by being evocative no
matter what the film calls for. I am not challenging his use of such
scenes, they are wonderful; but, I am put off by his inability to keep
the story from going cold.</P>
<P>The last part of this narrative, has all these parts of the tale come
together for a violent conclusion. It leaves us with the belief that the
violence will not be curtailed, but will go on; therefore, there will be
no such a thing as an end to violence.Thereby, the film's title is the
opposite of what the film really means to say. Or, is it?</P>
<P>Wenders has succeeded in creating a mishmash of images that are
incendiary, but not penetrating enough for us to believe in the
characters of the story, or to follow through on what this film is
supposed to be about. In fact, you might be angrier and more prone to
have a violent reaction to the film, than you would be to believe that
Wenders has taken this film in the direction needed for us to see what
is meant by an end of violence.</P>
<P>He lost me somewhere down the line. It seems to be a film concerned
about government conspiracies and missing persons, but turns out to be
more concerned with societal problems, values, and alienation, and does
not do any of these topics sufficient justice in covering it. This
results in a film that has a few good ideas but goes astray, leaving it
with a disjointed look, that is artistically satisfying to watch but
empty of meaningful inquiry.</P>
