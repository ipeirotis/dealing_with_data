<P>     For a romantic drama, RANDOM HEARTS sure doesn't begin the way you
would expect.  The film eases us into the worlds of its two principal
characters, Washington D.C. internal affairs cop William "Dutch" Van Den
Broeck (Harrison Ford) and New Hampshire Congresswoman Kay Chandler
(Kristin Scott Thomas).  Their lives run parallel for nearly an hour of
screen time, with Dutch investigating a pair of crooked cops and Kay
preparing for a tough re-election campaign.  Drifting through the
background is the event that will bring them together: an airline crash
that claims the lives of Dutch's wife Peyton (Susanna Thompson) and Kay's
husband Cullen (Peter Coyote).  With a languid silkiness, director Sydney
Pollack lets the characters develop independently before Dutch's suspicion
that Peyton and Cullen were having an affair sets Dutch and Kay on a
collision course.  The pacing may be slow, but the set-up is engrossing
and effective.</P>
<P>     Then, something horrible happens:  Dutch and Kay actually get
together.</P>
<P>     To understand what's so dreadful about the romantic story in RANDOM
HEARTS, you have to understand the laughter.  After a day together in
Miami exploring the possible scene of their spouses' infidelity, Dutch and
Kay return home exchanging portentous glances throughout their plane trip.
Finally, in Kay's car at the airport, they surrender to an angry, clumsy
clinch ... and the audience starts howling.  You could argue that they
were responding to the awkwardness of the moment, but I'm not sure I'd buy
it.  In a matter of seconds, it was obvious that people weren't buying
that relationship.  In a matter of seconds, RANDOM HEARTS had plummeted to
earth faster than the downed jet that brought Dutch and Kay together.</P>
<P>     Doomed romanced between wounded, grieving souls are nothing new in
dramatic cinema -- case in point: LAST TANGO IN PARIS -- but such films
generally focus on the essential emptiness at the center of the
relationship.  RANDOM HEARTS has too old-time-Hollywood a sensibility to
delve into that kind of psychological pain.  Scenes between Dutch and Kay
keep suggesting the potential for genuine affection between them,
something besides the mutual despair and betrayal that connected them in
the first place.  As a result, RANDOM HEARTS feels consistently and
resolutely false as soon as they start to go at it in the front seat of
Kay's car.  Pollack and company keep trying to transplant the heart of a
1940's weeper into the body of a European art film.</P>
<P>     It doesn't help that the story doesn't even make the best case for
the base emotions that first link Dutch and Kay.  On Dutch's side, it
makes more sense, as the top trained to look for corruption feels like a
fool when he discovers infidelity he never suspected for a moment.  The
transference of his anger at Kay's husband to sleeping with Kay works
thematically; Kay is another matter entirely.  She is almost unsurprised
to learn of Cullen's philandering, her absence of shock and rage
diminishing her motivation.  Scott Thomas tries to wring some plausibility
from Kay's actions, but it's hard to accept them as anything but plot
machinations.  When Harrison Ford -- looking a bit silly in his stud
earring -- says to her, "I was thinking about your mouth," you have to
believe Kay would have laughed in his face.</P>
<P>     Of course people in Hollywood love stories are always saying
ridiculously purple things to one another, and audiences roll with it all
the time.  It can only work, however, if the story is builty on one of
those sweeping archetypal premises in which soulmates are inspired to
rhapsodic poetry.  RANDOM HEARTS shouldn't have had the faintest whiff of
soulmates to it, not when the hook is the visceral response of two people
to an affair between their spouses.  Pollack is too polished and
professional a film-maker to produce an unwatchable product; he's also too
polished and professional a film-maker to delve into those dark places
where the film needed to live.  For nearly an hour, he has it all working,
using the character development to build a case for incompatibility.  By
the time the smiling, optimistic denouement rolls around, you know the
audience was right when their gut response to this relationship was to
laugh out loud.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 random numbers:  5.</PRE>
