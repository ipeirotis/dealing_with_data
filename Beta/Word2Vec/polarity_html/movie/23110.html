<P>There are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on
one actor's effort. Often a single performance can turn what might have been
a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile. When one of these comes
along, I usually try to think about how many other people put work into the
movie, that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire
project on his shoulders. But sometimes there is simply no other
explanation, and such is the case with "The Hurricane." This biopic about
falsely convicted boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter would normally be called
"Norman Jewison's 'The Hurricane,'" as per the tradition of referring to a
film "belonging" to a director. But though he does decent work, Jewison
cannot claim ownership of "The Hurricane," because there is one reason this
film works at all, and his name is Denzel Washington.</P>
<P>Washington plays Carter, a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night
shooting in a bar. Jailed for 20 years, he maintained that he had never
committed the crimes, but remained in jail after a second trial and
countless appeals. The situation changed when a group of Canadians moved to
Washington and worked on freeing Carter. Through the efforts of that group
and Carter's lawyers, he was eventually freed when their case was heard in
federal court and the judge ruled that Rubin Carter had been unfairly
convicted. The film details Carter's childhood, which had him in and out of
jail because of the efforts of a racist cop (Dan Hedaya). When he finally
got out of prison for good, Carter became a rising star as a middleweight
pro boxer, seemingly having his career on track, until the police framed him
for multiple homicide. Despite the efforts of political activists and
celebrities, he remained imprisoned. Flash forward to 1983, when Lesra
(Vicellous Reon Shannon) a young African-American boy, living with a group
of Canadian tutors, reads the book Carter wrote while in prison. The book,
entitled "The Sixteenth Round," opens young Lesra's eyes to the injustice
that was Carter's life, and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer.
Lesra convinces his Canadian friends (Deborah Unger, Liev Schreiber, John
Hannah) to work with him towards his goal.</P>
<P>"The Hurricane" leans on Denzel Washington. He must carry virtually every
scene by sheer force of will, and he does so brilliantly. It's probably
accurate to say that Washington does not embody Rubin Carter, because he
plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to
be. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that Washington embodies the
character of Rubin Carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the
film. The actor's work is masterful; Washington throws himself into every
moment, refusing to keep the audience at arm's length. We feel everything he
feels: the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard
to make something of his life, the pain of having to order his wife to give
up the fight, and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion
that all hope is lost. Washington's is a performance of weight and emotional
depth. He doesn't merely play angry, happy, or sad; he feels it at the
deepest level. His work is masterful, and for half of this film I realized
that the scene I was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it
was if it had been in the hands of another actor.</P>
<P>Norman Jewison directs the film, doing a reasonably good job of pacing and
shot selection. "The Hurricane" moves quickly, with no scene drawn out much
further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely. Jewison
handles his multiple flashbacks well; the audience is always aware of just
what the time and place of each scene is, and nothing is terribly confusing.
His boxing scenes, constructed with clear inspiration from "Raging Bull,"
get inside the action very well, and they are believable as real sports
footage. Jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a
pretty cool trick: Carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when
he refuses to wear a prison uniform, and Jewison, assisted by some wonderful
acting from a game Washington, shows how Carter gradually starts to lose his
mind during the constant solitude, and eventually we get three Rubin Carters
arguing with each other in one cell. Jewison's best achievement in "The
Hurricane" is succeeding at showing how Carter becomes an embittered man
during his hard-knock life, and how he is able to break out of that
bitterness and learn to trust people again.</P>
<P>Sadly, though, the film's chief failures lie with the screenplay, as with
most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter. There
is much to interest a viewer in "The Hurricane," but it seems that every
time the film gets a chance to take the most clichéd route possible, it
does. Take a look at the supporting characters, for example, who are drawn
up as either entirely good or entirely evil. Carter and Lesra (played nicely
by Shannon, who deserves credit) are the only real people here; everyone
else is a stereotype. The Canadians are good. The cops are bad. The
Canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their
lovey-dovey commune (and it is a commune, despite the film's failure to make
that clear), while every racist cop (especially Dan Hedaya's) melts in out
of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room. Much
of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ("Hate put me in prison. Love's
gonna bust me out."), and the big courtroom climax during which everyone
gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-TV
Lifetime special. It's too bad. The cast is game, the director does his job,
and the subject matter is interesting, but the script takes the safer,
slightly more boring route far too often. I wanted a real reason for the cop
to hold a grudge against Carter other than "he's a racist pig." I wanted
more evidence that these Canadians are real people with faults and virtues
instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice. In short, I
wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens.</P>
<P>Criticism has been levied against the liberties "The Hurricane" takes with
the truth of what really happened to Carter, and much of it is deserved. For
example, the film gives us a boxing scene showing Carter pummeling defending
champ Joey Giardello, only to be screwed by the judges, who ruled Giardello
the winner. Most accounts of the fight, however, have Carter losing fairly.
Furthermore, much of Carter's criminal past is conveniently left out of the
film, and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never
really explained. Of course, "The Hurricane" works mainly as a fable, so
digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially, but even
dismissing such issues don't remove one fact: "The Hurricane" is a highly
flawed film. Only one actor could have made a schmaltzy, predictable picture
like this work as well as it does, and it's a good thing "The Hurricane" has
that actor. Carter has been quoted as saying, "Denzel Washington is making
me look good," but he's not the only one. Washington makes this film look
good. Denzel Washington's "The Hurricane." Sounds pretty good to me.</P>
