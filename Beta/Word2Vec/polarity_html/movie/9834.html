<P>     Brutally obvious "message" film-making just doesn't get more
effective and entertaining than Ang Lee's THE ICE STORM.  Continuing the
trend of "Me Decade" venality-bashing begun by BOOGIE NIGHTS, it tells the
tale of two troubled families in suburban New Canaan, Connecticut circa
Thanksgiving 1973.  Ben Hood (Kevin Kline) is having an affair with his
next-door neighbor Janey Carver (Sigourney Weaver) though neither one is
sure exactly why; Ben's wife Elena (Joan Allen) tries not to acknowledge
that she suspects anything.  Meanwhile, 14-year-old Wendy Hood (Christina
Ricci) experiments sexually with both of Janey's sons, Mike (Elijah Wood)
and Sandy (Adam Hann-Byrd), while Wendy's older brother Paul (Toby
Maguire) tries to find a girl who isn't more interested in his prep school
roommate Francis (David Krumholtz).</P>
<P>     It takes no time at all to figure out that THE ICE STORM is meant as
a critical study of an era when all sense of stability and authority were
crumbling in America.  With the Watergate scandal in full flower, parents
dabbling in wife-swapping and even the local minister (Michael Cumpsty)
given to flirting with his flock, the film's young characters are left to
fumble for their moral way without a compass.  When the parents actually
do attempt to offer guidance, it proves worse than useless.  Janey catches
Wendy and Sandy together, then launches into a lecture which somehow
drifts into primitive anthropology; Ben's years-too-late facts of life
speech to Paul primarily covers "self-abuse" in the shower.  James
Schamus' script (adapted from Rick Moody's novel) makes it abundantly
clear that plenty of important things were left unsaid while suburban
parents of the 1970s were trying to be pals with their kids and "find
themselves."</P>
<P>     It is a credit both to the exceptional cast and to Schamus' finely
detailed script that THE ICE STORM doesn't come off like exactly the kind
of lecture those teenagers desperately needed.  Moments of cringe-inducing
awkwardness -- the tentative sexual games of youth, ill-advised romantic
advances, foolish attempts to recapture the irresponsibility of girlhood
-- spill off the screen as characters scramble aimlessly in search of some
sort of fulfillment.  Particularly vivid is the exploration of teen
sexuality, energized by the frank performances of Ricci, Wood and
Hann-Byrd.  The treatment is neither exploitative nor ignorant,
recognizing adolescents as far from the neutered creatures represented by
Sandy's G.I. Joe action figure.  Every performer turns in funny,
provocative work, adding layers of confusion, yearning and desperation to
a story which easily could have become pedantic.</P>
<P>     THE ICE STORM only gets clumsy in the scenes involving Paul, whose
infatuation with a wealthy New York girl is the stuff of over-earnest
coming of age dramas.  Toby Maguire has an affable charm, but his
character never feels fully integrated into the story; he's a nice-guy
throwback whose acts of conscience function primarily as counterpoint to
the mistakes made by the rest of his family.  His physical remove from the
action does end up working wonderfully in the powerful conclusion,
however, as tragedy forces characters to face up to their self-absorption
and realize what matters to them most.  It's an obvious lesson, perhaps,
but one delivered with skill and grace.  All family values sermons should
be this haunting and insightful.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 ice teases:  8.</PRE>
