<PRE>ROMANCE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Marie (Caroline Trousselard), a grade-school teacher with average looks,
has a host of problems, most of them sexual, in ROMANCE.  Her boyfriend,
Paul (Sagamore Stévenin), who refuses to have sex with her, tells her
frankly that he'd rather be alone reading a book or hanging out with his
male buddies at the local bar.  "I need to cling to him like a leech
because I'm madly in love with him," she explains to us in her constant
and insufferable narration.  She has a proclivity to carry on didactic
philosophical discussions of sexual issues while having sex, a definite
turn off to her partners.</P>
<P>She compensates for her boyfriend's not giving her the sex and the baby
that she wants by having kinky sex with friends and strangers.</P>
<P>ROMANCE by writer/director Catherine Breillat is described in the press
notes as "a daring exploration of female sexuality from a female point
of view."  Featuring an order of magnitude more explicit sex than any
movie this side of a porn film, the graphic depictions are as joyless
and unerotic as a medical textbook.  Even if Breillat has her actors
performing actual, not simulated, oral sex, she does it with such a
clinical detachment that the only reason to applaud the film is for the
risks it is willing to take.  Making it especially hard to endure,
ROMANCE's energy level is as low as its depressed heroine's.</P>
<P>Certainly we have had a large number of movies than explore violence
with graphic realism, so why can't similar ones be made with sexual
realism?  After all, we as a society are much more threatened by
violence than sex.  Whereas there is a case that can be made for making
something this sexually explicit, this movie fails spectacularly.  The
heroine is one notch above an automaton, thanks to the remoteness of the
director's approach.</P>
<P>Marie doesn't respect the men she picks up.  She'll do absolutely
anything with them (the camera makes sure that nothing is hidden), but
she looks away during the act and will use her lips for anything but
kissing the men on the lips.</P>
<P>A typical episode has her being seduced by a middle-age man, Robert
(François Berléand), who likes to tie his women up.  In an excessively
serious picture that is never intentionally funny, these scenes of ropes
and chains and Marie's contorted positions may have some laughing out
loud, since they are so ludicrous.  Robert, who admits that he isn't
handsome, wealthy, or attractive, claims to have made love to over
10,000 women.  His secret?  He's a good listener.  He has other boasts
too, all equally bizarre.</P>
<P>If you're inclined to check this movie out only because of the
titillation factor, don't.  There isn't an exciting moment to be found
in it.  On the contrary, monasteries might be advised to hold recruiting
drives in the lobbies.  If sex is this miserable, abstinence may be an
attractive alternative.</P>
<P>ROMANCE runs 1:35.  The film is in French with English subtitles.  The
movie, which was not submitted to the MPAA for rating, is filled with
actual sex scenes and frequent nudity and would not be appropriate for
anyone other than an adult.</P>
