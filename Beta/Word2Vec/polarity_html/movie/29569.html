<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>One of those innovative shoestring budget sci-fier films that Edgar G. Ulmer
made a career out of. This one is overall a competent work with some uniquely
atmospheric scenes. The film took six days to shoot in the old Pathe Hollywood
studio, though the film is set in the Scottish moors. It used the same set
designs as Ingrid Bergman did in the 1948 "Joan of Arc." </P>
<P>After scientists observe in an LA observatory the strange configurations of the
planets, a British astronomer, Professor Elliot (Bond), discovers an unknown
planet he calls Planet X. 
He figures it will come closest to the Earth in a certain isolated and marshy
island on the Scottish moors. He sets up a lab there with his attractive
daughter Enid (Margaret Field, the mother of Sally), in order to study the rogue
planet. One of his former students, Dr. Mears (Schallert), who is brilliant but
is also unstable and evil, unexpectedly shows up at his doorsteps and the
kindhearted professor lets him stay on to help. </P>
<P>The film's hero, John Lawrence (Clarke), is an American newspaper reporter who
knew the professor from the war. The professor promised him a chance to get a
big story if he was ever onto something, so he asks John to join him in his
Scottish moor retreat. </P>
<P>John when he's not making eyes at Enid and staring down the sleazy Mears, is
discovering strange things in the dark and rainy setting he's thrust into; such
as, a magnetic range finder that the unknown planet astronauts used to navigate
its spacecraft to Earth. Soon Enid is frightened when she sees an alien (it's
actually an uncredited vaudeville actor stuffed into a diver's mask, who is
sweating like crazy because he's having trouble turning the knob to adjust his
air intake). </P>
<P>The film's dilemma is about whether this alien is a friend or foe, as the
observers can't communicate with him. When the professor comes down with the flu
and is forced to his bed, Mears takes over trying to communicate with him and
decides that the alien has valuable info that could make him a very wealthy man.
So he decides to beat it out of him, which makes the alien a bit miffed at all
the Earthlings. One of the powers the alien has is mind control, and soon the
locals disappear and come back as enslaved zombies. When the local constable
teams up with the journalist, they discover the alien is picking them off one by
one and decide to get outside help from the army. To John's dismay he finds that
besides the locals-- Enid, the professor, and Mears have been taken. </P>
<P>To make a ridiculous story short, we learn that the alien comes from a dying
planet and they need to conquer the Earth in order to survive. Help will arrive
when the constable figures out a way to contact Scotland Yard and John
heroically confronts the alien and turns off his air pressure. The alien
invaders didn't put up much of a fight, but I bet if Ulmer had a few more days
of shooting time we would have seen a lot more action. </P>
