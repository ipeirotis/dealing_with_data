VIRUS (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Copyright 1999 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<PRE>Director: John Bruno</PRE>
<P>Writers: Dennis Feldman and Jonathan Hensleigh (based on the comic book 
by Chuck Pfarrer)</P>
<P>Starring: Jamie Lee Curtis, William Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, Joanna 
Pacula, Sherman Augustus, Marshall Bell, Cliff Curtis, Julio Oscar 
Mechoso</P>
<P>I suppose I'm not extremely surprised that "Virus" comes to us from a 
deciple of James Cameron (John Bruno), and if I strain real hard, I 
could even say that it's an obvious given, particuarly looking from the 
standpoint of Mr. Cameron's early works. In fact, "Virus" is yet another 
in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the "Aliens" 
vein: a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to 
find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them, a textbook 
example hailing all the way back to the early talkies, and maybe even to 
the first pictures, albeit redeveloped by Cameron in his 1986 
blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his 
future. No such thing will happen to Bruno, whom I believe worked in 
some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature; while Bruno may have 
studied under Cameron's wing for years and years, I'm beginning to 
wonder at what capacity, and what exactly did he learn from him. In 
fact, "Virus" should at least be mediocre; the fact that Bruno could 
have worked under a man like Cameron - a director who, if anything, just 
knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like "Virus" is just 
another detraction fairly aimed at this Z-grade schlockfest of a film, 
albeit a Z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget.</P>
<P>The film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's 
similarly-fated "Deep Rising," but also from a clunkish B-movie from the 
'80s called "Leviathan," an underwater thriller starring Peter Weller, 
Richard Crenna, Hector Elizando, and Daniel Stern about a group of 
miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part "Alien," part 
John Carpenter's twisted remake of "The Thing." "Virus," again, has a 
similar, uh, selling point: a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a 
Russian cruiser that is dead in the water. They get on. They break up 
into pairs and investigate. And they find an alien lifeform on board 
that comes in the form of energy, has taken over all the machines on 
board, have meshed the machines with parts from corpses, and have deemed 
humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary (ha ha).</P>
<P>Not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving; 
not only does this film start off with a chintzy Bond-ian opening (the 
destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from Mir), 
destroying any of the suspense in what could happen, but it also fails 
to bring us any interesting chracters. Of its motley crew, it only 
choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman 
skipper, a masculine potential-romantic-interest, a drunken captain, a 
black technician, a tatooed aborigine, a manic Russian survivor, and a 
couple other candidates for alien food, none whom are the least bit 
interesting or more dimensional than a thin, plain piece of writing 
paper. And it's not the traditional argument for films like these, where 
you may in fact want them all to be eaten (even "Aliens" played with the 
karma of the arrogant soldiers, but this was more of a plus-side for the 
film as a whole than the opposite); instead, as another cliche goes, you 
just don't give a damn. I almost don't even have to say that the acting 
from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific, the former being Jamie 
Lee Curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is (and 
she is, just not really here) and the latter being - and it pains me to 
say this as he's a particular favorite of mine - Donald Sutherland, who 
plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that 
this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed. Like 
Anthony Hopkins for "Legends of the Fall" (the line "Scrooooooo 'em" has 
been thus embroidered upon my membrance). Or Peter O'Toole in 
"Caligula." Great actor, horrific performance. It happens every now and 
then, and it only helps Sutherland's career that no one, except for an 
elite few, even bothered to see this film.</P>
<P>Though it has sat on the shelves of Universal Studios for about two 
years, waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it 
possibly can (read: early January, when everyone's still trying to catch 
up on the potential Oscar-nominees), it does show that Universal shelled 
out a pretty penny to make this film: it's laden with complex machinery, 
boasts respectable production design, and it may even feature believable 
special effects...if, of course, I, or anyone else, could see them. 
"Virus" mostly takes place on a large, abandoned cruiser, and mostly at 
night until the dawn, and mostly without the use of lights, not so much 
for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their 
human prey, but more so because, as the Hollywood cliche seems to go, 
"If it's dark enough, then the special effects will be more believable." 
And if you don't believe me, go back and rent "Godzilla," and tell me if 
there's even one shot where we see Godzilla either a) in his entirety in 
one wide shot, or b) n the light so that we can at least see him (well, 
you don't really have to sit through it again; just take my word for 
it).</P>
<P>But all of this doesn't matter since "Virus" is basically just one loud, 
cluttered mess of a movie. The action scenes are muddled and as 
difficult to follow as any action movie I've ever seen (my, um, favorite 
part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of 
the ship, during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves, rain, and 
any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up, then end up back in 
the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well, 
I must say, thanks for telling me afterwards because I sure couldn't 
figure it out when I saw it). Imagine the first attack of the aliens in 
"Aliens," shot from the POV of the soldiers and then the authorities in 
the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any 
dramatic intensity, and that's basically the whole of "Virus": one 
horribly-directed action scene after the other, capping it off with a 
proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the 
original cast members.</P>
<P>And my god, it's a long damn sit. With no interesting characters, no 
dramatic urgency, no tension, not one good moment of action, and no 
mesmerizing visuals, it's a wonder that it even got made. We already 
know that big movie studios' mentality is shallow at best, and movies 
like "Out of Sight" and "Saving Private Ryan" give you more faith in 
them, but movies like "Virus" manage to drain a little more out of the 
pool. I almost wish that instead of making this movie, John Bruno had 
gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with Universal heads when 
they gave this film a green light. They read the script, they knew they 
were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who 
might have very well been a Cameron hack (and he is), and they still 
went ahead with the project, only to have Bruno and company shit back in 
their face. Even though I hold Universal in contempt for making this 
horrible movie, I'd say even more contempt should be aimed at Mr. Bruno 
for making a movie that could be this bad. In fact, shouts of "Egad, 
man, what were you doing when you worked for Cameron anyway?" are not 
only justifiable, but encouraged.</P>
