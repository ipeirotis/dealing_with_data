<P>Last summer, a feature-length version of The Avengers hit theaters to
the tune of a
unanimous critical panning. Based on the famous 60's television show,
the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for
Warner Bros. A year later, the studio is up to their old tricks again,
with the unnecessary revival of the Robert Conrad program The Wild, Wild
West. But it sounded promising: the same tag-team of star Will Smith and
director Barry Sonnenfeld, who both contributed to make Men in Black
such a financial success, is at the reins again. And co-star Kevin Kline
is attached to the project, as well as a substantial budget to spice up
the special effects. I mean, what could possibly go wrong?</P>
<P>The answer is just about everything. Wild Wild West is a cinematic
abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that
it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate. There are a
lot of fancy special effects, and a handful of distinguished actors who
try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting
impression. But the script is so deliriously uneven, the entire movie so
off course, that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to
salvage it.</P>
<P>At square one, we have a bizarre case of casting. Will Smith plays James
West, a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor Robert
Conrad in the TV series. My guess regarding the casting of
African-American Smith is a simple one: the actor + a cozy summertime
release = big bucks for all those involved. Smith is a very talented
performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief
material, but this is not an ideal role for him. He's too much of a
joker. I heard that initial casting included George Clooney in the lead
role, and frankly, that sounds a lot more plausible. What makes matters
worse is that Smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in
his eyes; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that
he knows Wild Wild West will be a huge hit at the summer box office.</P>
<P>The plot involves West and cross-dressing government agent Artemus
Gordon (Kevin Kline), who are assigned by the President to recover a
group of kidnapped scientists. The trail leads to the diabolical Dr.
Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), a man with no lower body who speaks
in a dry, witty southern accent. Loveless has taken the country's top
technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of
total government control, using lethal superweapons to destroy entire
towns. One such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula, bearing eight
spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and
right. The visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are
spectacular, seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the
western surroundings. Unfortunately, all of these effects seem so
detached from the story, and can do little to support the film's plot
deficiencies, which are undoubtedly the main problem.</P>
<P>Wild Wild West is a running gag that never truly works. Most of the
jokes, usually care of Smith, die on arrival. If it's one thing that
could possibly be the saving grace, it's the performances, and even they
are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered. Kline is admirable, but he
has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot. Salma Hayek is
wasted as the romantic interest, because she is viewed as little more
than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between
West and Gordon. Branagh, an esteemed Shakespearean actor and director,
adds marginal enjoyment to the film. But even he is so utterly weird and
over-the-top. Rarely is a film so lost in itself as Wild Wild West is.</P>
<P>I suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season; a highly
anticipated, big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint.
Wild Wild West is such a movie, and will probably go down as one of the
biggest disappointments of 1999. But it is highly unlikely that this
will go down in defeat at the box office. Perhaps after this, audiences
will be less assured when they see Will Smith's name stamped on a summer
movie. After such hits as Independence Day and MiB, Wild Wild West is
not an impressive addition to the resume.</P>
