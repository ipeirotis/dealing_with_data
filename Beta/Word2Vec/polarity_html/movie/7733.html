<PRE>                              TRIAL AND ERROR
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     Sitting through the pathetically bad TRIAL AND ERROR, one's mind
naturally fantasizes about the movie that could have been.  In a film
where little is salvageable, two of the actors, Jeff Daniels and
Charlize Theron, develop characters that have potential, albeit almost
all of it unrealized.  Their romantic fling is the only glimmer of hope
in an otherwise dismal movie.  But their affair is so brief and
inconsequential to the heart of this slapstick comedy that it does not
come close to saving the picture.</P>
<P>     Charlize Theron, who gave an excellent but small performance as
Helga in 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY, plays a waitress named Billie.  Billie
was an astronomer on her way to grad school at Berkeley when a tire
blew out on her trailer in Nevada.  She liked the desert terrain so
much that she decided to live there in her stranded trailer and get a
job in a nearby town.  When she invites Charlie Tuttle (Daniels) to
ditch his rich lifestyle and live with her in bliss in the middle of
nowhere, it is easy to dream about the show that could have been
because the chemistry between them is promising.  But, this little
piece of the movie is a mere sideshow.</P>
<P>     You may remember Daniels from GETTYSBURG, which should have gotten
him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor, or from many other
films.  Hopefully, his fans will soon forget his part in this disaster.</P>
<P>     In TRIAL AND ERROR, new law partner, and soon to be newlywed,
Charlie goes to a courtroom in a tiny Nevada town to represent lifelong
con artist Benny Gibbs (Rip Torn).  Benny sells copper engravings of
Lincoln through the mail.  For $17.95, Benny mails his customers a
shiny new penny.</P>
<P>     Charlie gets drunk the night before the trial.  Through a
misadventure, his actor buddy Richard Rietti (Michael Richards) ends up
impersonating him in court.  Since they are never able to straighten
this out, Michael Richards becomes lawyer Charlie and Jeff Daniels his
assistant Richard.  It is not as funny as it sounds.</P>
<P>     Jessica Steen plays prosecutor Elizabeth Gardner, at whom Richard
makes a crude pass at the bar the night before the trial.  Typical of
the unbelievable humor of the show, his come-on line to her at the bar
has him talking about intercourse in the second sentence after saying
hello.</P>
<P>     Although director Jonathan Lynn has two good comedies to his name,
MY COUSIN VINNY and SGT. BILKO, most of his films, such as CLUE and THE
DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN, have not been very successful.  To be honest,
the blame for TRIAL AND ERROR should be shared with first-time writers
Gregory and Sara Bernstein.  They rely on unoriginal sight gags for
much of the (non-existent) laughter.  Characters fall through ceilings,
people get food stuck on their mouths, lovers walk in accidentally on
other lovers, actors fall over each other, guys sitting on the lawn get
soaked by the sprinklers, and the canonical list of cheap movie humor
goes on ad infinitum.</P>
<P>     As I left the theater I reflected on the film, ULEE'S GOLD, that I
had seen at a press screening earlier in the week.  It has marvelous
acting and a beautiful story, but with its low budget it will open at a
few art house around the country and be seen by almost no one.  TRIAL
AND ERROR, on the other hand, will play at thousands of screens.  It is
sad that so many people will accept TRIAL AND ERROR's poor quality when
films that deserve to be seen are ignored.</P>
<P>     TRIAL AND ERROR runs 1:38.  It is rated PG-13 for language.  The
film would be acceptable for kids say 10 and up.  I recommend you avoid
this unfunny comedy.  I give it * for the valiant attempts by Daniels
and Theron to rescue a sunken movie.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
