<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A slow paced, b&w, atmospheric melodrama, set in the mountains of
northern California, about a farm girl, Libby Saul (Ida Lupino),
romanced by an escaped convict, Barry Burnette (Dane Clark). One
character says of the farm, it is in such a remote spot, even the
coyotes don't come here.</P>
<P>Libby has felt imprisoned, leading a sheltered and unhappy life with her
miserable folks. Ellie Saul (Bainter), her mother, hasn't left her room
for years, she is so embittered over her marriage that she refuses to
even talk with her husband. Her father Cliff (Hull), is an angry man,
showing no love to his wife or stuttering daughter. It's a marriage
consumed by hate.</P>
<P>The 22-year-old Libby has enough of this and runs away to her secret
hideaway cabin in the woods, on the night of a big rainstorm, taking her
faithful dog Joe with her. There is a new coastal highway being built
with the help of a chain gang crew, which is going through her Big Sur
forest region. One of the convicts, Barry Burnette, escapes during the
severe rainstorm.</P>
<P>The two runaways meet in her cabin and fall in love. Barry explains how
his quick temper
always spelled trouble for him, and got him convicted of manslaughter
when he held up a jewelry store and killed the employee, though he was
too drunk to remember if he actually did it.</P>
<P>Libby exclaims that this is the first happy day she has ever had, as
they catch a trout and kiss, spending the night together. They make
plans to get to San Francisco and live together, but separate as she
goes back home to get food and a change of clothes for him.</P>
<P>The search party gets into a shootout with him at Stone Ridge, but he
escapes and returns to hide in her farmhouse barn.</P>
<P>On her return, things change at home, as her parents get together and
act civilized for the first time that she could remember. They also
notice that she's glowing with happiness and figure it's because she met
the road engineer, Jeff Barker (Wayne Morris), who expresses a keen
interest in her, and has even made plans with her father to go partners
in opening up a filling station once the road is completed.</P>
<P>The interesting part of the film revolves around the conflict Libby
faces, of running away with the violent fugitive she has fallen madly in
love with or have a secure marriage with a really nice man, the
engineer, but who is someone she doesn't love.</P>
<P>"Deep Valley" offers a dramatic look at how love can make one feel alive
again. The film comes to a boil with its very moving conclusion, after a
very slow start.</P>
<P>The acting is first-rate, making these melodramatics seem realistic.</P>
