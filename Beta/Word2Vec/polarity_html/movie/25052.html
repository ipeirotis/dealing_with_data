<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Imamura's last film before this one, was as long ago as Black Rain (89).
The director who was born in 1926, was an assistant to Yasujiro Ozu
early on in his career, but when he left him, he developed his own
style, which differs from the master's formal one radically--his is a
style of fractiousness, shunning with dread the idea of ever making a
perfect film. He has made 20 features in his 40-year film career. This
lyrical film shared with "Taste of Cherry" the Palme d'Or for 1997. It's
a virtuous film that after its violent beginning settles down and
becomes an amusing and insightful study about a man trying to find
himself after spending the last eight years in prison.</P>
<P>The film begins in the summer of 1988, Takuro Yamashita (Koji Yakusho)
is an nondescript office worker commuting to work by train, when he
reads an anonymous letter he received mentioning his wife is having an
affair, which take place when he goes on his all-night fishing trips.</P>
<P>On his next fishing trip, his wife packs him a picnic basket and wishes
him luck, but he returns early from his all-night fishing trip, and sees
a white sedan parked in front of his house. Through the house window he
sees his wife making ecstatic love with an unseen man. He draws a long
fisherman's knife when entering the bedroom and butchers her to death,
letting her lover go, who yells at him, you're a murderer, before
fleeing. He then pedals his bike to the police station, with his yellow
slicker still drenched in blood, and confesses to the police that he has
just murdered his wife.</P>
<P>When he gets out of prison, the guards give him the pet eel he kept in a
pond, which they told the other prison authorities was theirs, because
prisoners can't keep pets. A Buddhist priest (Fujio Tsuneta) will become
his parole officer for the next two years. Trained in prison to be a
barber, he opens up a shop in a desolate suburb of Tokyo, within a short
travelling distance from where the priest lives with his wife. It is
interesting to note how this couple take this murderer into their home,
something that would not likely happen in America.</P>
<P>Though Imamura paints Yamashita's character as being serious and
withdrawn, there are comical interludes which make him seem plain daffy.
When walking with the wise Buddhist priest, he sees some joggers go by
and joins them out of habit from the eight years of such jailhouse
routines and goes into his jog ala prison-style, and has to be called
back by the priest. He also talks to his eel, whom he keeps in an
aquarium. He explains, that he talks to the eel because he listens to
what I say.</P>
<P>Trying to reintegrate to society is not an easy thing for him to do,
feeling alienated from people, he is able to make contact with some of
the fringe members of his new neighborhood. One of them is a young
unemployed man (Kobayashi) still living with his parents, who believes
in UFO's. To help him attract them to his site, Yamashita lends him his
barber's pole, though one of the neighbors says all this talk of UFO's
has been started by the TV stations to boost their ratings. Another
friend is a neighborhood fisherman who takes him out nights on fishing
trips, and when he sees that Yamashita can't spear the eels because he
doesn't want to hurt them, he builts him a tunnel contraption to catch
them without hurting them.</P>
<P>His best catch, is an attractive 34-year-old woman from Tokyo, who
resembles his wife. She tries to commit suicide in this isolated area by
the river where he is fishing, and he saves her life by getting his
neighbors to take her to the hospital. Her name is Keiko Hattori (Misa
Shimizu), and she is despondent because she fell in love with the wrong
man. She also has problems because her man has been fooling around with
her mentally disturbed mother, who madly thinks she is a flamenco
dancer. She has just been released from a psychiatric hospital.</P>
<P>The Buddhist priest gets her to work in Yamashita's barber shop and she
brings all the social touches needed to make it a friendlier place,
which starts bringing in customers. She is also romantically interested
in him, but he pulls away, too scared to start a relationship.</P>
<P>Things change when a garbage man (Akira Emoto) who was in the same
prison, tells Keiko out of spite that the barber is a wife-murderer. He
drunkenily tries to rape her, and comes back later to fight with the
barber. We then learn more about Keiko and her problematic relationship,
and we also find out that Yamashita's jealous rage was caused because he
loved his wife so much.</P>
<P>Before we get to the riotously funny climactic scene, we are told about
the eel's habits, which is used as a symbol to explain Yamashita's life.
The eel's mating habits involve the female laying her egg in the waters
by the equator where the unknown father impregnates the egg, and then
the male eels migrate to the water's in Japan.</P>
<P>The climax brings most of the characters involved in the story together
in the barber shop for what could have been a serious fight, but instead
turns into a comical free-for-all among Keiko's ex-boyfriend thug,
Dojima (Taguchi), his henchmen, the town's policeman, and Yamashita and
his neighbors... The eel's aquarium tank is busted in the melee.</P>
<P>The rehabilitation of Yamashita is supported by his willingness to be
cooperative with his parole officer and come to terms with his crime
through how he feels in his heart, and by Keiko and his neighbor's
finding him trustworthy. But through the interactions of those in
society, not through any fault of his, the past catches up with him and
he again must face the consequences of the Japanese penal system... An
interesting film, that works most effectively as an introspective study
of how to deal with one's anger and love.</P>
