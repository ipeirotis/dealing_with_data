<P>     John Sayles is arguably the most ambitious American independent 
film maker working today.  His films -- those that he writes, directs, 
and edits -- are made entirely outside of the studio system.  Sayles 
fashions them on his own, because he demands the right of final cut.  
Only when a film is done does he seek out a distributor.  During his 18-
year career behind the camera, he has always been a maverick.  While 
most other directors make a few successful indie pictures, then sign a 
deal with a studio, Sayles continues to work as he always has, using the 
proceeds from the artistically limited screenplays he pens for the 
Hollywood behemoths (PIRANHA and CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR have Sayles 
scripts) to fund his more personal work.  </P>
<P>     Sayles broke onto the scene in 1980 with his directorial debut, 
RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN, the movie that inspired the better-known 
THE BIG CHILL.  His films since then have been remarkably diverse, from 
the lesbian drama, LIANNA, to the comic fantasy, THE BROTHER FROM 
ANOTHER PLANET, to the baseball movie, EIGHT MEN OUT, to the Scottish 
fairy tale, THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH, to the magnificently-textured LONE 
STAR.  Now, two years after his most critically-acclaimed effort to 
date, Sayles is ready to release MEN WITH GUNS, a film that breaks new 
ground (again).  Not only was this Central American-based tale filmed 
entirely outside of the United States, but the final script (after being 
translated from the English version that Sayles wrote) was in Spanish.  </P>
<P>     While perhaps not as masterful as LONE STAR, MEN WITH GUNS is 
nevertheless a very good film.  It stars Argentinean actor Federico 
Luppi (CRONOS) as Dr. Fuentes, an aging medical practitioner in an 
unnamed Central American country.  With retirement upon him, Fuentes is 
determined that some part of his teaching will outlast him.  He believes 
that his legacy lies in the contribution he made to a project that 
trained young men and women to be doctors before sending them out as 
"ambassadors of health" to remote Indian villages.  It has been years 
since Fuentes has heard from any of his former students, and he decides 
to take a trip out of the city to look for a few of them.  The deeper he 
gets into the wilderness, the more horrified he becomes by what he finds 
in different Indian villages.  Poverty and lawlessness are the chief 
characteristics of life.  Fear lies heavily in the air.  Politics are 
meaningless.  To the common farmer eking out a living, there's no 
difference between guerrillas and soldiers -- they're all men with guns 
who steal and kill.  </P>
<P>     Along the way, Fuentes assembles an unusual group of traveling 
companions.  The first to join him is an orphaned young boy (Dan Rivera 
Gonzalez), who knows the way of the back roads that the doctor must 
traverse.  The next member of the group is a solider who has deserted 
(Damian Delgado) and whose prized possession, a revolver, has no 
bullets.  Later, the band is enlarged by a priest who has lost his faith 
(Damian Alcazar) and a mute woman (Tania Cruz) who is in search of 
solace.  </P>
<P>     One of the most vociferous arguments to develop against MEN WITH 
GUNS focuses on the setting.  Sayles has placed all of the action in a 
fictitious Latin American country, declining to indict any particular 
government for the travesties that are shown (guerrillas killing men for 
helping soldiers; soldiers killing men for helping guerrillas).  And, 
while there is a legitimate argument for "naming names", Sayles' point 
is that the themes and issues he addresses are universal in nature, and 
that there's no reason to pin down a specific country.  These kinds of 
human rights abuses have happened throughout history and are still 
taking place all across the world wherever oppressors with superior 
technology use their position of strength to dispossess and suppress the 
indigenous population.  </P>
<P>     Sayles presents MEN WITH GUNS from Fuentes' perspective -- the 
doctor represents the audience.  At first, he is cocooned by ignorance, 
but the further he proceeds from civilization, the more he realizes how 
frail his legacy is.  His vaunted program has failed because of his own 
hubris.  Fuentes believed he was preparing men and women to face the 
real challenges of the wilderness, but his lessons proved to be woefully 
inadequate.  At one point, a former student says to him, "You're the 
most learned man I've ever met, but also the most ignorant."  Our eyes 
are opened along with Fuentes'.  As he learns, so do we.  </P>
<P>     Each of Fuentes' companions has a story.  The boy has lived with 
poverty and death his entire life.  He has learned to endure hunger, 
because no one in his village has much to eat.  He is blasé about murder 
and torture -- those are common aspects of his day-to-day existence.  
The deserter starts out by robbing Fuentes, but fate conspires to put 
his life in the doctor's hands.  Sayles gradually peels back the layers 
of his personality until we discover the real reason why he left the 
army.  The priest, like Fuentes, has lost his faith as a result of being 
in the wilderness.  He has seen and learned things that have reduced his 
doctrines to meaningless words.  And the mute woman, who has not spoken 
since she was raped two years ago, needs to find a reason to live.</P>
<P>     It is a credit to Sayles that he creates five vivid, three-
dimensional characters in two hours.  In actuality, the film runs a 
little long (this often happens when a director edits his own material, 
since he can be reluctant to cut certain potentially unnecessary 
scenes).  The performances are all good, and, although the acting in 
many Spanish-language films tends towards over-the-top melodrama, Sayles 
keeps his actors focused so that their work is relatively low-key.  Two 
Americans, Mandy Patinkin and Kathryn Grody, have small-but-important 
parts.  Their characters serve a dual purpose -- to provide much-needed 
comic relief and to illustrate how it's possible to be focused on the 
past but oblivious to the present.</P>
<P>     Reduced to broad generalizations, MEN WITH GUNS is an adventure 
story -- a sort of DON QUIXOTE meets HEARTS OF DARKNESS.  What marks 
this film as special isn't just that the surface details are believable, 
but that there is great richness and breadth to the issues addressed 
within.  Where does innocence end and ignorance begin?  How much 
responsibility do we bear for circumstances when we hide from them?  
And, if we learn the truth, how do we respond when all roads lead to 
desperation, futility, and failure?  While MEN WITH GUNS ends on an 
artificially uplifting note, the prevailing tone is one of bleak 
hopelessness.  This is a thought-provoking motion picture that, like 
many of Sayles' other efforts, demands that we ponder complex questions.  </P>
