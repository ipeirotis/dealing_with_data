<PRE>             LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (LA VITA E BELLA)
                A movie review by Joe Barlow
                    (c) Copyright 1998</PRE>
<P>STARRING:  Roberto Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Giorgio
                Cantarini, Horst Buchholz, Sergio Bustric
DIRECTOR:  Roberto Benigni
WRITERS:   Roberto Benigni and Vincenzo Cerami
RATED:     PG-13
RELEASED:  1997 (1988 in the USA, subtitled)</P>
<P>        Roberto Benigni's "Life is Beautiful" is the sort of film
which exemplifies the power of cinema: it's art without pretension,
hope without fear, dreams without restrictions.  Although it has been
criticized as a sanitization of the Holocaust, the movie pulls no
emotional punches; by sharing the hardships and joy of the characters,
we are reminded just how precious and remarkable the human spirit is.</P>
<P>        It's 1939 Italy, and Guido Orefice (Benigni) is a pleasant,
amiable waiter who works in a restaurant owned by his uncle.
Clever and impulsive, Guido uses humor as an ally while serving his
customers, making him well-liked, especially by Dr. Lessing (Horst
Buchholz), a German who shares Guido's fondness for puns and riddles.
Their relationship is particularly intriguing, as Guido is Jewish.</P>
<P>        When a chance meeting with the lovely Dora (Nicoletta
Braschi, Benigni's real-life spouse) sets his heart aflutter, Guido
goes to great lengths to win her love, despite her engagement to
a snooty government official.  Their mutual affection gradually
deepens into something more, culminating in a wonderful scene in
which Guido disrupts Dora's engagement party to whisk her away on
horseback.  It's here that a more conventional film would end... but
there's nothing conventional about "Life is Beautiful," and this scene
occurs less than halfway through the story.</P>
<P>        Flash forward six years to 1945: Guido and Dora are happily
married, and are now parents to a five-year old son named Giosue'
(Giorgio Cantarini).  Fortune has been good to them: Guido even owns
the bookstore he's always wanted!  But Guido's Jewish heritage is
discovered by a facist-filled government, and he and his son are sent
to an unidentified concentration camp.  Dora, a Gentile, is not
required to attend the camp, but she demands to go with her family;
her devotion to her husband and child is that selfless.</P>
<P>        Young Giosue' is frightened, but it's here that Guido
gives his greatest performance, convincing his son that they are
embarking on a grand adventure, an epic game that will be exciting
and fun.  (The prize for winning the game?  A full-size tank!)  Guido
knows that the Nazi officers who run the camp are looking for reasons
to dispose of the prisoners, so he tells Giosue' that he (Giosue') can
win extra points for hiding, remaining silent for long periods of
time, etc.  These are poignant scenes, as father and son rekindle each
other's enthusiasm and optimism (Dora is in a different part of the
segregated camp).  Although the other children are gradually
disappearing into the camp's gas chambers, Guido uses humor to keep
his son oblivious to their fate, sparing Giosue' from the emotional
agony and sense of helplessness that he himself is feeling.</P>
<P>        The structure of "Life is Beautiful" is somewhat like Robert
Rodriguez's "From Dusk Til Dawn," in the sense that each half of
the film has a completely different tone, joined together by a
startlingly abrupt transition.  It's ingenious and effective: both
halves of the movie are masterfully constructed, but as different as
night and day.  The warm, sunny first half establishes these wonderful
characters and their relationships; we see Guido's remarkable
personality in full-swing, and witness the passion and joy he derives
from simple, ordinary activities.  These early moments also set up
his fairy-tale love affair with Dora (Guido refers to her as his
"princess" throughout the story), and their devotion to each other is
made clear-- we understand why she is willing to follow Guido to a
concentration camp.  The story's second half, by contrast, uses their
love as a foundation on which to build triumph and tragedy.  The
construction is as elegant as any I've encoutered.</P>
<P>        It's impossible not to like Benigni's warm portrayl of Guido,
the sort of clown who inspires laughter as much by accident as
deliberate effort; his mannerisms are so broad and cartoonish that
comparisons with Chaplin are justified.  Benigni, who not only
starred but directed and co-wrote the screenplay as well, has a
masterful sense of comedic timing.  The material flows effortlessly
through him, lending both spontaneity to the gags and power to the
drama.</P>
<P>        Benigni doesn't skimp on the humor, despite the subject
matter; even during the horrific scenes inside the camp, Guido is
full of life and optimism-- a veritable beacon of hope and sunshine
for his fellow prisoners and, most importantly, his son.  There are
those who have called the film "offensive" because of the way it
handles its Holocaust-related material.  They are mistaken: this movie
isn't *about* the Holocaust; it's about humanity, love, and the
desperate facade one man must invent to spare mental anguish for
his son.  The Holocaust is merely a backdrop.</P>
<P>        There are perhaps ten genuine laugh-out-loud moments in
"Life is Beautiful," sprinkled in among the tragedy; like the
characters in the film, Guido's antics make the despair bearable for
us, right up to the movie's final moments, which involve the triumph
of the human spirit over the unimaginable forces of adversity.  The
film soars, heartens, saddens, uplifts, rejoices... and, like life, is
beautiful indeed.</P>
<PRE>              RATING: **** (out of a possible ****)</PRE>
