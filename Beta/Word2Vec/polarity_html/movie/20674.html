<P>     Francis Veber writes an interesting brand of farce.  For 25 years, he
has been the master of French high-concept comedy -- LE GRAND BLOND AVEC
UNE CHAUSSEURE NOIRE, MON PERE CE HEROS, LE JOUET, LES FUGITIFS, LES
COMPERES.  Where most farce either soars or crashes, Veber's occupies a
little-seen middle ground: funny enough that people like it, but not so
spectacular that it intimidates Hollywood's remake-happy execs.  "We can
do this even better," they quite reasonably say to themselves.  They then
proceed spectacularly not to do so -- THE MAN WITH ONE RED SHOE, MY FATHER
THE HERO, THE TOY, THREE FUGITIVES, FATHER'S DAY.  The simple talent for
being just entertaining enough suddenly doesn't seem quite so simple.</P>
<P>     THE DINNER GAME (LE DINER DE CONS) is quintessential Veber.  The
concept begins with the titular mean-spirited amusement, a weekly
challenge among several friends to bring the guest that's the biggest
loser, entirely unbeknownst to the mock-ees.  The story takes a turn,
however, when Dinner Game participant Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte)
throws out his back on the evening of the dinner, preventing him from
attending.  Unfortunately, Brochant's "guest" -- sadsack bureaucrat
Francois Pignon (Jacques Villeret) -- is already on his way to Brochant's
flat.  Thus begins a comedy of errors as the bumbling Pignon tries to help
Brochant with various problems, from his aching back to reuniting him with
his estranged wife Christine (Alexandra Vandernoot).</P>
<P>     Set almost entirely in Brochant's flat, THE DINNER GAME certainly
feels like the stage play adaptation it is.  Occasionally, that means the
film feels claustrophobic, with people waiting for phones to ring or doors
to open.  Veber can be something of a minimalist farceur, his direction 
taking the Blake Edwards route of getting out of the way of comic
situations rather than trying to contribute much to them visually.  His
best trick is cutting to stone-faced reaction takes by Lhermitte and
Francis Huster (as Brochant's pal), and his pacing isn't exactly
spectacular, especially in an 80 minute film.  By no means is this a
film-maker without his flaws.</P>
<P>     As a writer, however, Veber does know how to set up a gag and knock
it down.  There are punch lines in THE DINNER GAME that should be obvious
from the moment they're a speck in the distance, yet somehow they still
manage to zing.  Much of the credit for their success goes to Villeret, a
round-faced actor with a wild fringe of hair who could pass for a young
James Coco.  Villeret's Pignon is an exaggerated creation, to be sure, but
his bizarre goofs are made endearing by his obvious desire to be liked;
he's like a Great Dane who wags his tail so hard he knocks over everything
around him.  THE DINNER GAME generates some big-time laughs, and does
generate momentum towards its climax, when a visit by a tax auditor
(Daniel Prevost) creates even more chaos.</P>
<P>     Veber does predictably try to find a moral to the story, allowing
Brochant to learn a lesson about using cruelty as a spectator sport.  It's
a token effort, since neither Veber nor Lhermitte seem much interested in
developing Brochant as a character until the final five minutes.  There
are also a couple of jokes that just don't work in translation -- puns
that feel too forced, and a put-on Belgian accent that's only as riotous
as your familiarity with Belgian accents.  Still, THE DINNER GAME amuses
and entertains persistently, if not consistently, mining its basic
dolt-with-fuming-straight-man premise for all it's worth.  That final
point should be emphasized, since the Internet Movie Database notes that
Veber is preparing his own English-language version of THE DINNER GAME.
He should know by now that one moderately appealing comedy is generally
all his farces are worth.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 reasonable farces:  7.</PRE>
