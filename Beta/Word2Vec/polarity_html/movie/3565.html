<PRE>                                 THE CLIENT
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     THE CLIENT is the fourth of John Grisham's five novels.  I read
the first four on vacation in Hawaii last year.  I saw THE FIRM,
awarded it ** 1/2, and gave it a mild thumbs up.  I avoided THE PELICAN
BRIEF because it got such awful reviews.  They have not made movies of
the first or fifth books yet.  I found that liked the movie, THE
CLIENT, for some excellent acting and for the great Grisham plot.</P>
<P>     Repeating his THE FUGITIVE type of role, Tommy Lee Jones plays the
quintessential prosecutor who would do anything to get the bad guys in
jail.  Here Jones plays a U.S.  Attorney who wants his next job to be
that of Governor of Louisiana, hence he wants good press coverage.  A
young boy (Brad Renfro) may have overheard some information that Jones
and the mob both want.  He hires a tough but very inexperienced lawyer
played by Susan Sarandon to defend his rights and to protect him from
both sides.  This is the basic plot set up.  There are a lot of twists
and turns after that - some predictable, some not.</P>
<P>     Almost every word Jones utters is terrific.  The script is good,
but his delivery is what makes it.  I love the way he delivers the
lines: "I want that boy in court, manana! You hear what I'm say'n?"
Almost as good is Sarandon.  She plays a complex character that is both
tough and vulnerable.</P>
<P>Renfro plays the archetypal burnt out teenager.  His performance was
acceptable at best.  I think they should have got a stronger actor or
at least the director, Joel Schumacher, should have given him more
guidance.  Renfro was not convincing enough for me.  Then again, maybe
it was the way Grisham wrote the character that I have problems with.
There were numerous minor characters of merit.  The judge (Ossie Davis)
was the best of the small performances.</P>
<P>     THE CLIENT runs 1:57.  It is correctly rated PG-13 for a little
violence and a modest amount of profanity.  (It would be XXX rated for
smoking.  Almost everyone smoked, and they smoked a lot.  Cigarettes
were even used in evidence.  NONE of the smoking was necessary.) I
think kids over 12 will enjoy the show.  I recommend it and award it
***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
