THE CONTENDER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>In Washington, duplicity runs deep.  But, in THE CONTENDER, the 
extremely impressive second feature film by writer and director Rod 
Lurie (DETERRENCE), there is at least one politician for whom principles 
are more important than politics, even if her integrity costs her the 
honor of being the nation's first female vice president.  Speaking of 
honors, expect to see this political thriller and morality tale garner 
many well deserved Oscar nominations including, but not limited to, Best 
Actress (Joan Allen) and Best Supporting Actor (Gary Oldman).</P>
<P>Ohio Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) is a Republican turned Democrat 
and an avowed atheist.  She may not believe in God, but she certainly 
has an unfailing commitment to her principles.  "Principles only mean 
something if you stick to them when it's inconvenient," she explains 
with utter sincerity.  She may or may not be the next vice president, 
and it is her adherence to her principles that seems likely to come 
between her and the job she so desires.   Allen, in a consistently 
strong performance, never lets Senator Hanson dissolve into 
self-righteousness.  She gives a sympathetic performance that doesn't 
require sympathy to admire.</P>
<P>The elected vice president died six weeks ago, so President Jackson 
Evans (Jeff Bridges) has to choose a successor.  Knowing that 300 FBI 
agents investigated Nelson Rockefeller, the only other vice presidential 
replacement, President Evans wants to make his choice carefully.  But 
it's more than that.  Six years into office, the president views the 
choice as his "swan song."  </P>
<P>The sharply written script mixes heavy drama with sweet comedy.  The 
president, for example, not having to run again, is kicking back and 
really enjoying the trappings of his office.  He brags that he can order 
absolutely anything he wants 24 hours a day, and he can never stump his 
chef.  He even has a bowling ball with the presidential seal engraved on 
it, which he uses in his own private bowling alley.  It's a great life, 
and he's making the most of it.  Bridges's charismatic performance is 
full of nuances and subtlety that leaves us never quite sure of his 
motivations.</P>
<P>As the story opens, popular Senator Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen) 
seems to be the likely nominee, especially after his daring attempted 
rescue of a girl whose car goes into the lake near where he is fishing.  
Surprisingly, the President brushes his candidacy aside, claiming that 
someone might decide that his heroism was actually another Chappaquidick 
episode.  This sets up Senator Hathaway to be the shadow candidate for 
those opposed to the president's eventual nominee, Senator Hanson.</P>
<P>The president's long-time nemesis, Congressman Shelly Runyon (Gary 
Oldman), ends up chairing the nomination hearings.  Looking like a 
nerdish version of Roberto Benigni (LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL), Runyon's body 
shakes nervously and his upper lip perspires profusely when he presides 
over his committee.  The congressman is at once utterly polite and 
completely devious.  When he uncovers a college sex scandal involving 
Senator Hanson, he salivates at the possibilities and doesn't shy away.  
He and his fellow conspirators brag to themselves that they are going 
"to obliterate a life."  Runyon's wife worries, with good reason, that 
"he will go down as a second-rate Joe McCarthy."  No matter how 
unlikable Runyon becomes, Oldman never lets him dissolve into 
caricature.</P>
<P>In a great, one-dimensional part, Sam Elliott plays Kermit Newman, the 
president's hard-nosed Chief of Staff.  When the scandal breaks, Newman 
screams his demands.  He wants dirt on Runyon, immediately: "Little 
boys, midgets, cows," whatever they can find.  His approach, however, 
isn't the one that Senator Hanson feels comfortable with.  She wants to 
talk nothing but policy at her hearings -- the usual liberal litany of 
ban all handguns, abolish the death penalty and guarantee a woman's 
right to choose.  She specifically refuses to dignify with any response 
the accusation that she "put on a sex show" in college.  After all, she 
reasons, if she were a man, no one would care about how many women she 
had slept with in college.</P>
<P>All of the casting in this ensemble effort is terrific.  Christian 
Slater is good as a naive and ambitious young congressman who, in a 
career enhancing attempt, negotiates his way onto the nominating 
committee.  Like a minnow swimming with sharks, he seems in constant 
danger.</P>
<P>Lurie's staging is masterful, even if sometimes a bit over the top.  As 
Congressman Runyon denounces Senator Hanson to the world -- "Laine 
Hanson is a cancer!" -- we watch her jog through a military cemetery and 
pass the Iwo Jima monument to the brave boys who fought for our freedom.</P>
<P>The beauty of the story is that we keep waiting for more shoes to drop.  
Some of them do, but others we expect to, don't.  And still others drop, 
but turn out not to be what we expect.  My only complaint is that one 
key twist is needlessly telegraphed.  </P>
<P>"You are an enigma...," the president says to Hanson, his would-be vice 
president, late in the story.  Interrupting him, she completes the 
famous quote, "wrapped in a riddle."  The movie itself is no enigma.  
Its principles are crystal clear and dramatically demonstrated.  THE 
CONTENDER is ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN for our time.</P>
<P>THE CONTENDER runs 2:05.  It is rated R for strong sexual content and 
language and would be fine for most teenagers.</P>
