<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>In Marzieh Meshkini's beautiful Iranian film set on Kish Island, in
southern Iran, "The Day I Became a Woman," there are three interlinking
stories (allegories) about the three different stages of a woman's life
(childhood, young womanhood, an old age). In the first story entitled
Hava (Akhtar-Hava is Persian for Eve), a girl of nine reluctantly
becomes a woman and must from now on wear a chador (shawl) in public and
can't play alone with boys anymore. The first part of the film is
grounded in reality, telling about the child's hardship of so suddenly
losing her innocence. In the second story entitled Ahoo (Toloui-Ahoo is
Persian for deer), a wife in her twenties would rather be divorced than
stay married to her domineering husband. This story is very colorfully
photographed and has very little dialogue. The final story is surreal
and is very comical. It is entitled Houra (Seddighi-Houra is Persian for
nymph), and she's a widow, probably, in her eighties, who has just
inherited a lot of money and can buy whatever she wants for the first
time in her life. The beach and the seaside is an integral setting for
each of the stories. It should also be noted that all the heroines are
determined to get what they want but the first two are not in a position
to win their fight; but, it is only Ahoo who is forced physically to
accept her fate by men.</P>
<P>Marzieh Meshkini is the wife of noted Iranian film director Mohsen
Makhmalbaf. He served as the film's screenwriter. The three stories
reflect how women suffer from repression because of the strict
observance of Muslim law. In the third story when a woman finally has
gained her freedom, she doesn't know what to intelligently do with her
newly found freedom as she becomes overwhelmed with consumerism. Her
freedom comes too late for her. Even though they are different women
depicted, it might as well be the same woman because the film is a
metaphor for all Iranian women.</P>
<P>The first episode opens with the cute little girl Hava wanting to go
outside and play with her friend Hassan (Nabehan). Her mother
(Sisizadeh) and granny (Pasand) decide that since she was born at noon
and it is now 11 a.m., she could play for one more hour before putting
on her chador. To know the exact time they give the girl a stick and
tell her to put it in the sand, and when she can't see the stick's
shadow it is time to come home. Just before her time is up, she shares a
lollipop with Hassan. Strangely enough, the Iranian censors wanted the
director to cut this part because they found it too erotic. They had no
other objections to the film.</P>
<P>In the second episode Ahoo, with a number of other women, is in a bike
race on a bicycle path (the only one in Iran where women are allowed to
ride) -- with the Persian Gulf to their side; all the women are wearing
their black chadors and full black dresses. Her frantic husband comes by
on a horse and insists she quit the race. He says if she doesn't, he
will divorce her. When she continues racing the Mullah who introduced
her to her husband and married her, rides by her on his horse to urge
her to obey her husband. He tells her she is riding on "the devil's
mount." When this also fails to stop her from pedaling furiously on,
members of her tribe on horseback yell out to tell her how she has
disgraced their family. She is finally stopped by her two brothers, who
are also on horseback. They take her bike; but, we do not know if she
takes another rider's bike and continues on or if she was forced to
stop. We know exactly how she feels and how determined she is not to be
bullied by them, as we clearly see her animated facial expressions. In
any case, it is evident from this episode that a divorce can be attained
quite easily by a man.</P>
<P>In the last episode the elderly widow Houra gets off the airplane and is
placed in a wheelchair, where a young black boy wheels her to the
bazaar. On her fingers she has tied on different colored strings so she
can remember all the items she wants. She goes on a shopping spree and
purchases everything she always wanted to have in her house: a modern
stove, a refrigerator, a kitchen table, a sofa, a new bed, and so. Her
main problem is that she has forgotten what the red string is for, and
hesitates to leave without trying to figure out what she has forgotten
to purchase. A group of boys wheel the stuff to the beach in a parade
from the bazaar and deposit it on the beach. When she returns to the
store to return a tea kettle, the boys fool around with her goods. On
her return from the bazaar she has the boys load it onto rafts to take
it to a boat out at sea, where she will return home to feed her rooster
(that was her other main concern). Because of her age she doesn't have
to wear the chador anymore. But this freedom has come too late, she has
lost her beauty and offers no more temptations to the men. Hava can be
seen in the last shot of the film wearing her chador, as she has
returned to the beach to watch the old lady departing Kish. Perhaps
there can be detected a knowing look in her eyes of what the future
holds for her.</P>
<P>This is an irresistible film. I ate it up as quickly as I used to lick
an ice cream cone when I was a kid. You can learn more about Iran from
watching a movie like this one than you can by following the news
stories reported by the media.</P>
