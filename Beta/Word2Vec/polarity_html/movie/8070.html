<PRE>INTRODUCTION</PRE>
<P>About twelve minutes into his film version of LA TRAVIATA, Franco
Zeffirelli brilliantly captures one of the most joyous scenes in all opera:
At a glittering, festive party, Alfredo (played by tenor Placido Domingo)
is called upon to make a toast, and he responds with the famous "Il
Brindisi" ("The Drinking Song"). The catchy melody he sings is then
repeated by Violetta (played by soprano Teresa Stratas). A few moments
later, that melody is picked up by the Chorus of the Metropolitan Opera,
and it becomes obvious that Alfredo and Violetta are falling in love. Every
time I see this scene I am reminded of something Kenneth Clark once said
while standing on the Pont des Arts in Paris: "What is civilization? I
don't know. I can't define it in abstract terms. But I think I can
recognize it when I see it; and I am looking at it now."</P>
<P>In his early career, Zeffirelli was mainly involved in stage productions,
which provided much of the background he needed later for his noted screen
adaptations of Shakespearean plays (ROMEO AND JULIET, THE TAMING OF THE
SHREW, HAMLET). Zeffirelli's stage work included extensive opera
experience, so it is not surprising that he made a dazzling screen version
of LA TRAVIATA, bringing to it his trademark use of charming locations,
extravagant sets, and magnificent costumes. Zeffirelli's ability to deal
with spectacle is evident in nearly all his films, but ROMEO AND JULIET and
the cult favorite BROTHER SUN, SISTER MOON (the life story of St. Francis
of Assisi) show that he can also handle intimate, poetic material well, and
the balance achieved between the intimate and the spectacular in LA
TRAVIATA is masterful. Zeffirelli has often been criticized for his
unabashed sentimentality, but in LA TRAVIATA the story and the music make
this quality an asset rather than a liability.</P>
<P>Zeffirelli designed his film version of LA TRAVIATA expressly for the movie
medium, and the look and feel of it are not much like that of a filmed
stage performance. Most of the story is presented during one long
flashback, and on several occasions, the film shows the visual images in
characters' minds. More importantly, the principal singers are good film
actors, generally avoiding the theatrics required for a live performance at
a large opera house or in the concert hall. For the most part, the facial
expressions and subtle body language in close-ups are just right, and I
found myself caring a lot about the fate of the people in the story. Also,
I think there is good screen chemistry between Stratas and Domingo, and at
first viewing, the movie can be enjoyed as a simple story of doomed love.
But I have found a deeper satisfaction after watching the film many times
because that's what it took for me to appreciate the psychological
complexity of the characters and Zeffirelli's visually dense treatment of
them. In contrast, Giuseppe Verdi's music is rather simple, but it is
varied and tuneful and, above all, emotional. </P>
<PRE>BACKGROUND</PRE>
<P>Verdi took the story for his opera from the 1852 French play LA DAME AUX
CAMELIAS (THE LADY OF THE CAMELLIAS) by Alexander Dumas the Younger. Dumas
based his title character on an actual person who died at age 24 of
tuberculosis in 1847. The woman was called Marie Duplessis, and to this day
people still put flowers on her grave in Paris. Dumas originally named his
fictional heroine Marguerite Gauthier, but she became generally known in
America as Camille because the name was changed in the touring stage
version popularized by the famous actress Sarah Bernhardt. Several movie
versions were eventually made of the story, the best known of which is the
classic 1936 Hollywood film CAMILLE, starring Greta Garbo.</P>
<P>Verdi saw the play LA DAME AUX CAMELIAS in Paris shortly after its premiere
and, working with a libretto by Francesco Maria Piave, developed the
material into the Italian opera LA TRAVIATA. There seems to be no
completely satisfactory translation of Verdi's title into English, but
perhaps the literal, if awkward, SHE WHO HAS STRAYED conveys the meaning
adequately. Although the opera retains the Paris setting of the Dumas
story, the characters have been renamed, and all of the first names are
Italian. In particular, the main character in the opera is called Violetta
Valery. </P>
<P>Verdi had already written more than a dozen successful operas before LA
TRAVIATA, but when it was first performed in 1853 at Teatro Fenice in
Venice, it flopped. It seems likely that audiences were startled by what
was at the time novel subject matter, as well as by the romanticism of the
music, and these difficulties may have been compounded by production
problems. After only two performances, LA TRAVIATA was taken off the
boards. But when a slightly revamped version was performed fourteen months
later, it caught on, and the work has remained popular for over 140 years.
One of the most famous singers to regularly perform the role of Violetta
has been Maria Callas, and Zeffirelli worked with her on some productions.
Incidentally, opera legend has it that one of the reasons for the failure
of the initial production of LA TRAVIATA was that the Venetians openly
snickered at the idea that the overly plump soprano playing Violetta was
wasting away from tuberculosis. In this connection, it should be noted that
Teresa Stratas, the Violetta in Zeffirelli's film, is appropriately
slender.</P>
<P>The social setting depicted in LA TRAVIATA probably needs a little
explanation for modern audiences. Violetta and her female friends were
members of the demimonde, that is, the class of women whose social standing
had been diminished by what was perceived as their sexual promiscuity. Such
women exercised considerable independence and often entered into mutually
convenient arrangements with wealthy men. The man in such an arrangement
was sometimes called the woman's "protector." While the social standing of
members of the demimonde was below that of women of unquestioned
respectability, it was still well above that of the courtesan class, and it
would be a mistake to think that 1850's opera goers regarded Violetta as a
prostitute.</P>
<PRE>SYNOPSIS</PRE>
<P>While the title credits roll at the beginning of Zeffirelli's LA TRAVIATA,
the screen is filled with beautiful wintry location shots of parts of
Paris, such as Notre Dame and the Seine, that look much the same today as
they did around 1850. In an unlit house, workmen are quietly removing
objets d'art, while a gravely ill woman lies alone in bed, coughing. The
woman is the consumptive heroine Violetta, whose possessions are being
taken to cover debts she has incurred. One of the workmen, a very young
man, pauses to stare at a large portrait of Violetta, and the Metropolitan
Opera Orchestra plays the haunting love theme that comes to symbolize
Alfredo's devotion. Violetta rises momentarily from what will be her
deathbed and looks toward a large darkened room where workmen are moving
about, and in her mind she is transported back to the pivotal night of her
life, a night when the house was  brightly lit and filled with a noisy
party crowd. It is then that the singing begins, in Italian, with an
English translation displayed in subtitles at the bottom of the screen.</P>
<P>Violetta is hosting a lavish summer party at her extravagantly furnished
home. She is accompanied by her protector, Baron Douphol, who does not live
with her, and it quickly becomes apparent that her relationship with the
Baron is a loveless one. Violetta's tuberculosis gives her some bad
moments, but her health is still good enough that she can enjoy most of the
festivities. At the party, she is introduced to Alfredo Germont, who has
loved her from afar for a year. Alone with her briefly, Alfredo declares
his love in the aria "Un di felice, eterea" (here the subtitles read "One
day, so radiant and ethereal"), which includes the love theme melody
mentioned earlier. Later the guests depart, and left alone with her
thoughts, Violetta begins the famous aria "Ah, fors' e lui che l'anima," as
the words "It must be him whose portrait my soul" appear in the subtitles.
As part of an interior monologue, she goes on to sing the love theme
melody, but then she suddenly snaps out of her meditation with the
realization that yielding to her desire to love Alfredo would be folly, at
which point she sings the flashy "Sempre libera degg'io" ("I must be
forever free"). However, in her imagination she still sees Alfredo and
hears his voice reprising the love theme, and as the screen fades to black,
it is clear that she will not be able to suppress the love she feels for
him.</P>
<P>Zeffirelli's film makes a visually pleasing transition from Paris to a
nearby country villa where Violetta and Alfredo live together for three
happy months. Violetta's health appears to have improved, and she and
Alfredo are shown enjoying a variety of simple outdoor activities during a
golden autumn. For example, Violetta is shown trying to cross a log over a
shallow stream to reach Alfredo, but she loses her balance and falls in.
When Alfredo bends to help her out, he too gets pulled into the stream, and
they laugh and share a kiss. Then, at a time when Alfredo is away for a few
hours, his father (played by baritone Cornell MacNeil) pays Violetta a
visit at the charming, secluded villa. The elder Germont demands that
Violetta break with Alfredo because their relationship is jeopardizing the
marriage prospects of his daughter. Violetta reluctantly agrees to the
demand, believing that her sacrifice is necessary to the happiness of the
Germont family. With great sadness, she realizes that she must go back to
the Baron since if she remains alone, Alfredo will follow her. Unaware of
what has happened, Alfredo returns to the villa and is shocked when
Violetta abruptly leaves him. He mistakenly believes that she has grown
tired of him and he has been dumped so she can resume the exciting life she
used to lead. Although he attributes Violetta's actions to the wrong
motive, Alfredo correctly guesses her next move, and in an agitated state
he heads for a demimonde party that will be held that evening.</P>
<P>The scene shifts to an elaborate party in Paris, complete with singing and
dancing gypsies and matadors. Zeffirelli enhances the diversion by
including ballet dancers, two of whom are from the Bolshoi. Alfredo enters
alone, and soon Violetta arrives on the arm of her old protector, Baron
Douphol. It is clear from the outset that the Baron and Alfredo are both
leaning towards provoking the other into a duel. Alfredo joins a card game
where he gambles recklessly and wins, while the Baron loses. Supper is
announced, and after a tense exchange between Alfredo and the Baron,
Violetta and Alfredo meet privately for a moment. Alfredo angrily presses
her for explanations, and the only way she can keep her promise to his
father is by telling him the lie that she loves the Baron. In a jealous
rage Alfredo drags Violetta to the dining area and calls for the assembled
guests to watch while he insultingly throws his gambling winnings at her in
payment for the time they have spent together. Violetta is devastated, and
everyone condemns Alfredo's shameful behavior. As the scene draws to a
close, the Baron challenges Alfredo to a duel.</P>
<P>The long flashback that began with the dying Violetta looking toward the
large darkened room near the beginning of the film finally comes to an end.
Apparently three or four months have passed since the Baron challenged
Alfredo to a duel, and Violetta has not been in contact with Alfredo, his
father, or the Baron subsequently. Violetta's financial resources have been
exhausted and the moment of her death is near. She receives a letter from
the elder Germont saying that Alfredo seriously wounded the Baron in the
duel and left France for a while, but the Baron has now recovered.
Furthermore, Alfredo's father has relented and told his son of Violetta's
sacrifice, and Alfredo will be coming to see her soon. However, Violetta
fears that it is already too late, and she desolately prays to God "Ah!
della traviata sorridi al desio!" as the words "This woman gone
astray…Smile upon her…" appear in the subtitles. The mood is momentarily
lightened by the sights and sounds of Mardi Gras revelers in the street,
and Violetta's spirits are further lifted by Alfredo's arrival. Alfredo
apologizes to her, and the film shows Violetta's happy dream of a time in
the future when she, with her health restored, is walking with Alfredo in a
marvelous wooded area, and together they approach a beautiful tree. Next,
Alfredo's father, filled with remorse, enters Violetta's bedroom and begs
her forgiveness. Then, with reconciliation complete, Violetta expends her
last bit of strength in giving Alfredo a medallion containing her portrait
and asking him to honor her memory by passing it on to the woman she
expects he will someday marry. Violetta's dreadful pain disappears, and she
feels intense joy for a few fleeting moments before she falls dead on the
floor.</P>
