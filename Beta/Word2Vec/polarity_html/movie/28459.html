<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A fast-paced film noir about corruption and double-crosses, that has a
lot of plot twists and a nifty surprise ending. The film opens with a
car crash involving escaped murderer Dixie Logan (Blackley), Assistant
District Attorney Larry Dale (MacDonald) and his wife Marian Langdon
(Walters). The two men die, but Marian is brought to the hospital in
critical condition with a head injury and confesses to reporter George
Mitchell (Wade) what really happened. The film is told in flashback
until Marian finishes her story.</P>
<P>The flashback opens as Marian appears for the advertised job as
secretary to the assistant district attorney and is spotted by Mitch,
who is in the office ahead of her to see Dale about a news story. By
accident he pushes the button on the intercom and overhears an argument
between District Attorney Forsythe (Trowbridge) and Dale. When Marian
enters, Mitch takes one look at the pretty lady and is attracted to her.
He takes her out to lunch and talks Dale into hiring her.</P>
<P>When asked why she wants to work for Dale she tells Mitch that she
admires the job he did in convicting Dixie Logan, who received a 20 year
jail sentence. She disregards that Dixie claimed he was framed and would
get Dale for what he did to him; instead, she agrees with Larry who
says, all felons say that about their prosecutors.</P>
<P>It soon becomes apparent that Dale is working with underworld kingpin
Gus Miller (Paiva), but Marian plays like she doesn't notice it. One day
Miller comes to see Dale in his office and he notices the janitor
(Barnett) is one of Dixie Logan's boys. He has his men throw him down
the elevator shaft in the court building.</P>
<P>Miller suspects something fishy about the new secretary and asks Larry
to fire her, which Larry is reluctant to do but agrees to anyway. When
back in his office, he notices it was  bugged. The janitor bugged it
before his sudden death. But he thinks Marian did it and decides to
marry her so she can't testify against him. After the justice of the
peace performs the marriage ceremony one of Miller's men tries to shoot
her as she steps outside, but misses. Back at home she tells Larry she
knows how crooked he is and that the shot was meant for her, but she
will work with him to be elected district attorney if he smashes the
three gangs (Miller, Forman, and Blake) that have a hold over him. But
he must promise this power-hungry woman that he does everything by the
book (no killings) from now on. She also tells him that she knows that
he and the underworld gangs framed the gangster Logan so that they could
control the city.</P>
<P>Larry comes up with a diabolical plan to play one gang against the
other. One of his first problems is that the two phony witnesses (Hecht
and Riordan) against Dixie weren't fully paid off for their work and now
must be rubbed out. But Dixie intercepts them first and gets them to
confess on paper that they lied on the witness stand and that it was the
three gang leaders who paid him. When they leave the apartment, Miller's
men have orders to 'shoot to kill' the phony witnesses. Meanwhile, the
omnipresent snoop Mitch overheard the witnesses talking with Dixie and
knows Dixie didn't shoot them because he was talking with him when they
were shot. He tries to talk Dixie into going to the police with that
confession and clearing his name, but Dixie has other ideas and
overcomes the reporter and escapes with the confession.</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoiler to follow.</PRE>
<P>Back in Larry's office all the confusion gets cleared up, as Dixie
appears. It turns out that Marian is his wife and he was in disguise as
the justice of the peace, so that the marriage was a bogus one. But when
he finds out that Marian mailed all the evidence against Larry to the
honest D.A. Forsyth, he slaps her and tells her he could have worked a
deal with Dale to run the city. She cries out: "You're no good," as the
two criminals take her in the car to kill her. That was the car that
crashed before the flashback began.</P>
<P>Mitch talks the D.A. into throwing out the confession she sent him and
she comes out of it as clean as a whistle, as the reporter is still
smitten over her.</P>
<P>The film was cheaply made and the acting didn't distinguish itself. But
the story had a lot of snap to it. It's not a bad watch, but lovers of
film noir should like it more than others.</P>
<P>Two of the film's stars, Douglas Blackley and Susan Walters, changed
their professional names after the film to Robert Kent and Luana
Walters.</P>
