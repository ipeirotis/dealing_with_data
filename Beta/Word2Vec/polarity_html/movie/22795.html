<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Stanley Kubrick's first big financed A film and first film with a major
Hollywood star. Kirk Douglas who liked the script, thinking it would
give him a chance to work on a quality film with a strong social
message, thereby getting his production company to back it. Kubrick
prior to  this film was a photographer for LOOK magazine and directed
the low-budget films "The Killers" (46) and "Killer's Kiss" (55). The
film is based on a true event and was filmed in Germany, with the German
extras playing the French soldiers in the trenches.</P>
<P>The film must have ruffled many feathers, because it was banned in
France for about 20 years. The U.S. army refused to show it on its
theater release date. It was also banned for a time in Austria,
Switzerland, Belgium, and Germany. This antiwar film, one of the best
ever made, much like Renoir's masterpiece "The Grand Illusion," does a
great job of criticizing the role of the French military higher-ups in
WW1. The movie turns most of its attention to the action taking place in
a military courtroom court-martial and the interplay between the
officer's political manuevering for power. It culminates in the
unjustified court-martial for cowardice of three randomly picked
soldiers, showing how callow the military is for taking these soldier's
lives in so arbitrary a fashion. Its battle scenes played like a
documentary, with striking attention turning to details of life in the
trenches and how the men stood up after being confined to such dark and
squalid circumstances, contrasted with how the staff officers live in
the luxury of chateaus. Kubrick's masterpiece was more cynical and
gritty than Renoir's very poetic and humane indictment of war. One
reason why this was so, was because it hit harder at those who were its
subjects and as a result many country's reacted so vehemently as to
officially oppose the film.</P>
<P>It should also be pointed out, that the ambitious Kubrick rewrote the
original script to give the film a more traditional Hollywood upbeat
ending to it, much to Kirk Douglas's surprise and disapproval. Kubrick,
reportedly, wanted the film to be a box office success and was willing
to forgo artistic integrity. The controversial ending might be termed a
cop-out by many, while others found its sentimentalities quite
appropriate and cynical enough.</P>
<P>The two did not get along well on the set, but that did not stop Douglas
from years later requesting the very talented Kubrick to direct
"Spartacus (60)," the last Hollywood type of film Kubrick ever directed.
Incidentally, in my opinion, the major flaw in Paths of Glory wasn't the
taut script, which was lucid and hard-hitting, but it was in Kirk
Douglas's egomaniacal performance (though a strong performance and the
best one in Kirk's career). But, as forceful and necessary as Kirk's
performance was, it still allowed the film to become centered around
him, rather than on the universality of the story unfolding in its very
natural and engrossing way about the horrors, evils, and insanity of
war.</P>
<P>Kubrick aimed for a critique both of war and of class systems. He
accomplished this by pessimistically and cynically showing how the
privilege class cares only about themselves and how its power is
corrupting.</P>
<P>The action picks up in France in 1916. We are told that World War I has
dragged on for two years and that it became a stalemate of fortified
trenches and heavy casualties.War began between Germany and France on
August 3, 1914. Five weeks later, the German army had come within 18
miles of Paris. There the battered French miraculously rallied their
forces at the Marne River, and in a series of unexpected counterattacks,
drove the Germans back. The Front was stabilized and shortly afterward
developed into a continuous line of heavily fortified trenches
zigzagging their way five hundred miles from the English Channel to the
Swiss frontier. By 1916, after two grisly years of trench warfare, the
battle lines had changed very little. Successful attacks were measured
in hundreds of yards - and paid for in lives by hundreds of thousands.</P>
<P>The film opens with the French General Staff deciding from the safety of
their luxurious chateau far off enemy lines that it is time to attack
the `Ant Hill' tomorrow. The object of the attack is an impregnable and
fortified hilltop held by the Germans, without any strategic value.The
two cunning and detestable generals- the commanding staff general,
General George Broulard (Adolphe Menjou), who asks the field general,
Paul Mireau (George Macready), to take this impossible suicide mission,
despite knowing it will kill most of the men. At first, Mireau says he
can't do it, he will lose too many men. But then Broulard says that a
promotion awaits, there will be consideration for another star. Mireau
then consents and arrogantly visits the troops in the trenches,
accompanied by his ass-kissing aide, Major Saint-Auban (Anderson). He
manages to slap a shell shocked soldier (Bell) while rallying the
troops, saying there is no such a thing as shell shock, as he transfers
him out of his outfit, not wanting cowards.</P>
<P>The general confers with the company commander of the 701st, Colonel Dax
(Kirk Douglas), a criminal trial lawyer in civilian life, and appeals to
Dax's patriotism to go through with the attack. After Dax says it is not
possible to do, Mireau says, "Show me a patriot and I'll show you an
honest man." Dax replies, quoting from Samuel Johnson, "Patriotism... is
the last refuge of the scoundrel." Finally, Dax is convinced to lead the
attack when he is threatened with loss of command. He then becomes
subservient to the general and says he doesn't want to desert his men.</P>
<P>The attack the next morning is a colossal failure, as the men who do
attack are mostly killed. It is made worst by a commanding officer's
cowardice, Lieutenant Roget (Wayne Morris), who never orders his men to
leave the trenches, leaving the first line of soldiers without backup.
Mireau watches the battle begin from the safety of his chateau, drinking
a toast to France as the battle begins. Mireau soon becomes upset at the
men for not taking the Ant Hill and for stopping their attack, and
orders the artillery commanders to fire on his own troops, which they
refuse to do, even when threatened with court-martial. They ask for that
command to be a written one.</P>
<P>The next day Mireau meets with Broulard and requests that a 100 men be
randomly chosen as scapegoats and executed as a lesson for cowardice in
battle. This is to serve as a lesson for the rest of the troops, he
warns. Broulard suggests that they make it 12 men. But Mireau, not to be
undone in the generosity of the moment, says let's make it 3 and have
the 701st's three commanding officers choose one from each outfit.
Broulard says we better get a court-martial for them and make it legal.
Dax when he hears of this insanity, asks to be the accused's defense
counsel and is granted that right.</P>
<P>Dax will meet the men chosen to die, as he goes to their cell. They are
Corporal Paris (Meeker), Private Arnaud (Turkel), and Private Ferol
(Carey). All of them express shock at what has happened to them and how
they were chosen. Corporal Paris was chosen by  Lieutenant Roget because
the officer murdered Lejeune (Dibbs) on patrol and Paris knew that.
Arnaud, a former medal-awarded hero, was chosen by a random drawing of
lots. The weepy Ferol was selected because his captain believed he was a
"social undesirable." Since the trial is fixed, the men are found guilty
and are given a last meal in their cells, which they think is drugged.
They are also visited by the priest (Meyer), who hears their confessions
and offers what Arnaud calls sanctimonious pat answers for what has
happened to them. Being drunk from the meal's wine, he attacks the
priest but is knocked down by Paris, causing him to be placed on a
stretcher when the men are executed in the morning.</P>
<P>Dax had told Broulard about the artillery commanders charging Mireau
with ordering his own men fired upon the night before the execution,
giving him the written statements of all the witnesses who will confirm
that this happened. But the general refused to stop the execution,
instead he waited for after the execution to tell Mireau that there will
be an investigation about that matter so the military name is not
stained. Later, he calls Dax in and informs him that he can have
Mireau's position. Angrily, Dax turns him down, as Broulard looks at him
incredulously, as if he were a fool, saying you really cared about
saving those three men, you are an idealist. Dax angrily reproves the
generals on their despicable and inhumane actions and is forever shut
out of the privileged military club.</P>
<P>As Dax leaves the general, he comes across the men in a tavern where a
young German woman (his wife Christiane) is forced to sing as the men
act like brutes. When she starts to sing and tears roll down her face,
they eventually become quiet and are moved to softly sing with her. Dax
is told by his sergeant (Freed) that orders have come and that it is
time for he and his men to return to the front. Dax tells him to give
the men a few minutes.</P>
<P>The film is direct and powerful. It wouldn't have been banned for so
long if it didn't hit home with its hard message. There is no doubt
about its message being man's inhumanity to man, that war is insane, of
military incompetence, of class differences resulting in special
privileges for some, of hypocrisy, and that power is corrupting.</P>
<P>It is magnificently shot, as the trenches are frighteningly real and
incomprehensible to understand until seen. Kirk Douglas is overwhelming
in his stabilizing role, in my opinion too much so. But, nevertheless,
his anger is warranted, as he is the emotional glue that holds the film
together and gives humanity some measure for hope. Though I came away
from the film feeling no hope. I was cynical of everyone's motives,
including Dax's. After all, he still led the men to their slaughter,
even when knowing this would be so. To call him a hero, as the ending of
the film implies by its crass sentimentality, as it shows him going back
to the front, left me cold. A real hero, someone who is brave and beyond
reproach, would have become a pacifist after that incredulous suicide
battle plan and mock trial. He would have walked away from the war.
Adolphe Menjou and George Macready came through with outstanding
performances, each one an incarnation of Machiavellian evil. When on
screen, their performances are like machine gun fire directed at you.</P>
<P>There is much to chew on idea-wise, despite how simple the film might
appear on first viewing it, and thereby lies its true greatness, as it
seems to make a timeless argument against war; and, as in most Kubrick
films, it is not dated, in fact, it seems to get better with age.</P>
