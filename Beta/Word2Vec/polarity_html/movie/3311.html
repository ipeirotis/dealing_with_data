<PRE>     "Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home!  Your house is on fire, your 
children all gone..." 
          - Childrens' nursery rhyme </PRE>
<P>     Theoretically, the function of the social worker is to help families 
through difficulties.  In Ken Loach's latest, LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD,  it's 
shown that good intentions don't always have beneficial results.  Loach's 
films (such as RIFF-RAFF and RAINING STONES) are always doped with social 
commentary, and this one is no different.  Here, the villain is a process 
that places regulations over human interests, where a child becomes a 
pawn in a struggle between the State and the Mother. </P>
<P>     In this case, the Mother is Maggie (Crissy Rock), a passionate and 
lively woman with four children--each from a different liaison.  The 
latest's father, with whom Maggie is now living, is violently abusive.  
To get away from him, Maggie checks into a woman's shelter, but an 
accident there nearly causes her oldest child to die in a fire, and the 
social agencies take all four children into custody. Court appearances 
turn into bitter shouting matches, and Maggie's offspring are placed into 
foster care. </P>
<P>     Meanwhile, Maggie has met Jorge (Vladimir Vega), a rare "good" man. 
He's a political refugee from Paraguay whose English visa has expired.  
But he remains as an illegal alien and takes a low-paying job in order to 
stay with Maggie.  Together, the two have a child (her fifth; his first), 
but social workers have long memories and all it takes is one nasty word 
from a nosy neighbor to put Maggie's maternal fitness in question once 
more. </P>
<P>     As powerful and stinging a story as LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD is (and it's 
based on real events), it's the performance of Crissy Rock that makes the 
film work.  Rock, a standup comic with no previous acting experience, is 
incredible.  Her high-voltage rendering of Maggie is so emotionally 
volatile that the movie becomes a draining experience to view.  You don't 
just watch Maggie; you experience along with her--and what she's going 
through isn't the sort of thing that anyone wants to be a part of. </P>
<P>     The questions raised by LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD are compelling, if not 
unique.  Loach frequently uses film to examine the inadequacies of the 
British social system, and here we're forced to consider the issue of 
when a woman is truly incapable of raising a child.  While there seems to 
be reasonable justification for taking Maggie's first four offspring, 
what happens thereafter illustrates the kind of capricious horror that 
can occur when those in power don't really understand a situation. </P>
<P>     Often, LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD is brutally unpleasant.  However, Loach 
has never been known for lightweight movies, and comparisons between his 
work and Mike Leigh's NAKED are well-deserved.  Those disturbed by that 
picture are unlikely to feel comfortable during LADYBIRD--but comfort 
certainly isn't what the director was aiming for.  In large part because 
of Rock's performance, this production becomes far more than a simple 
tale of one woman's fight to raise a family.  Instead, it's an 
unforgettable portrait of human anguish and the price that any society 
must pay when its best intentions go awry. </P>
