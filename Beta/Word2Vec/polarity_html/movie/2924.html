<P>     Writer/director Darnell Martin, filming her first feature, was
determined that the final version of I LIKE IT LIKE THAT would match
her initial intent.  Despite pleas and threats from Columbia (who
bankrolled the project), she would not add to or alter certain scenes
to increase their sentimental content, nor would she make changes to
advance the film's likelihood of pleasing crowds.  When the producers
asked for something that was not part of Martin's script, she
categorically refused to capitulate, at one point expressing a
willingness to see the picture shelved rather than tampered with.</P>
<P>     The result is a film with a clear sense of vision.  I LIKE IT LIKE
THAT has its share of minor glitches and problems, but its overall
depiction of life in the Bronx's Latino community comes across with
startling clarity.  Martin's film is a frantic work, with the chaos
surrounding her main characters vividly presented.  Many times, so much
is transpiring on screen that it's difficult to know what to focus on.</P>
<P>     Similar in theme and content to Allison Anders' MI VIDA LOCA, I
LIKE IT LIKE THAT tells the story of Lisette Linares (Lauren Velez), a
young wife and mother struggling to cope while her husband Chino (Jon
Seda) is in jail.  Without a job, she has no money; hence, no way to
bail him out, feed the children, or keep the youngest one in diapers.
Her only support comes from her cross-dressing brother Alexis (Jesse
Borrego), who offers advice rather than money (he's saving up for a
sex-change operation).  When she finally gets a job opportunity as an
assistant to music producer Stephen Price (Griffin Dunne), everyone in
the neighborhood misunderstands her relationship with the white guy in
a hot car, and the salacious gossip eventually makes it back to the
jailed Chino.</P>
<P>     At first glance, I LIKE IT LIKE THAT might appear to be yet
another in the rapidly-expanding catalog of "life on the street"
stories.  This film's tone is distinct, however, with a polished style
more reminiscent of Spike Lee's CROOKLYN than the numerous "grittier"
ghetto tales.  This is not a low-budget production, and it shows.</P>
<P>     Martin sets up two different worlds: the Bronx, with its poverty,
stoop-sitting, and drug deals; and the working world to which Lisette
escapes each day.  In every way, the portrayal of the former is
stronger than the latter.  When it comes to the streets and apartments
of a decaying neighborhood, Martin's feel for setting is on-target, and
at times almost overpowering.  In the offices and restaurants where
Stephen Price hangs out, however, things are not as well-defined.</P>
<P>     The dynamics of the central relationship between Lisette and
Chino, while following a fairly traditional arc, are interesting
because of the characters' multi-dimensionality.  Strongly independent,
Lisette needs a source of freedom and solitude, and a means away from
home of reinforcing her sense of self-worth.  These things she finds in
her job.  Chino, on the other hand, is defined by traditional macho
attitudes.  He doesn't want his wife to work--supporting the family is
his responsibility.  How these two balance their dreams and fears with
the need to care for their children represents the movie's most
engaging aspect.</P>
<P>     Occasionally, Martin is over-reliant on facile plot devices, and a
few of I LIKE IT LIKE THAT's scenes have a self-conscious feel (this
mostly occurs when the script attempts to force a comic moment rather
than letting the humor occur naturally).  The two "weak links" are
Dunne's Price and Rita Moreno's Rosaria Linares (the "wicked
mother-in-law"), both of whom are relatively uninteresting types.
Rosaria's primary reason for inclusion appears to be for comic relief.</P>
<P>     In a high-voltage screen debut, Lauren Velez captures the
audience's attention and keeps it riveted.  She outshines the rest of
the cast, including the respected veterans.  Films of this sort demand
strong lead performers, and I LIKE IT LIKE THAT has a standout.</P>
<P>     Movies in the 'hood often feature heavy smatterings of violence,
but I LIKE IT LIKE THAT is more often concerned with emotional scarring
than the physical equivalent.  There are moments when beatings are
shown (obliquely or directly) but, with the exception of a
brief-but-telling scene, guns do not play a role.</P>
<P>     I LIKE IT LIKE THAT comes roaring off the screen with intensity, a
loud soundtrack, and a lot of fast-paced dialogue.  Focused in purpose
and adept in execution, the movie provides a new window into inner city
life.  While the themes and subjects are not unique, the manner of
their presentation is, and for that we can be thankful to Darnell
Martin for her obdurate attitude when faced with producers more
interested in box office grosses than artistic content.</P>
