<P>     Barring a television adaptation of CASINO ROYALE in the 1950s (not 
to be confused with the 1967 movie of the same name), 1962's DR. NO was 
the first opportunity fans of Ian Fleming's James Bond had to watch the 
intrepid superspy in action.  However, producers Harry Saltzman and 
Albert Broccoli wanted their movie to appeal to a wider audience than 
just Fleming's readers.  To that end, they altered the 007 of the novels 
to better fit the screen.  Bond became more suave and witty, and less 
cold-blooded.  Nevertheless, the hero of DR. NO is still grittier than 
he would become by GOLDFINGER (released only two years later), and bears 
little resemblance to the version of Bond essayed by Roger Moore 
beginning in 1973.</P>
<P>     Although many have rightly commented that DR. NO (the movie) is one 
of the closest cinematic interpretations of any Bond novel in tone and 
plot, Sean Connery was not among Fleming's choices to play 007 (the 
author stated his preference to be David Niven).  That didn't stop the 
public from immediately embracing Connery, and, after just one movie in 
what was to become cinema's longest-running series, he was regarded as 
the definitive Bond.  Today, even after four others have taken the role, 
stalwart Connery fans view George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, 
and Pierce Brosnan as impostors.</P>
<P>     Story-wise, DR. NO isn't all that different from most of the other 
Bond plotlines, although it is a little more "bare bones".  When a 
British agent assigned to Jamaica disappears, M (Bernard Lee) sends 007 
to the Caribbean to look into the situation.  Upon arrival, Bond is 
immediately the target of a would-be assassin, and, as his investigation 
leads him closer to the truth, attempts on his life become more 
frequent.  After joining forces with CIA operative Felix Leiter (Jack 
Lord), Bond enlists the aid of boat owner Quarrel (John Kitzmiller) to 
take him to Crab Key Island, which is ruled by the mysterious Dr. No 
(Joseph Wiseman).  Once there, in addition to meeting a scantily-dressed 
young woman named Honey Ryder (Ursula Andress), 007 learns why no one 
ever returns from Crab Key.</P>
<P>     With the exception of the big explosion during the film's finale, 
DR. NO is a low-key adventure.  There are no gadgets, forcing Bond to 
rely on his ingenuity (in one scene, when he needs to breathe while 
submerged, he uses hollowed-out reeds as air tubes).  The single car 
chase is reasonably straightforward.  And, for the only time in the 
series, 007 is unmistakably brutalized, appearing bloody, beaten, and 
disheveled as a result.  Regardless, he still defeats the villain and 
gets the girl.</P>
<P>     Many elements of the "Bond formula" are present in their infancy.  
Maurice Binder does the opening titles, although they lack the flair of 
his later contributions.  The "James Bond theme", co-created by Monty 
Norman and John Barry (although exactly who is responsible for the bulk 
of the piece remains a topic of contention to this day), peppers an 
otherwise unmemorable score.  M and Moneypenny make their screen debuts 
(Q first appeared in the next film, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE), and the 
first -- and perhaps best-remembered -- Bond girl, Ursula Andress, sets 
a standard that hasn't wavered in more than thirty years.  All-in-all, 
DR. NO is a successful, if not superlative, motion picture.  While it 
may appear tame by the standards of the later productions, it's an 
entertaining look back in movie history at a project that developed into 
a worldwide phenomenon.</P>
