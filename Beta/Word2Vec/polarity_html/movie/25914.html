<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"The Apple" is the first feature by Samira Makhmalbaf, the 17-year-old
daughter of the Iranian filmmaker, Mohsen Makhmalbaf (Gabbeh). It is
based on a true event and uses the actual family involved in relating
this odd but wonderful story, which is told in a wryly humorous manner.</P>
<P>In the poor section of south Tehran, 12-year-old twin daughters,
Massoumeh and Zahra, are locked in their one-room house, kept from going
outside, from attending school, from any contact with the outside world,
left unwashed, barely able to speak except in gurgles, and are without
friends. The father is a 65-year-old impoverished, poorly educated,
unemployed religious fundamentalist, who gets hand-outs from people who
ask him to pray for them. The mother is blind, fearful of life, and
unwilling to let the girls be free because of her insecurities and
mental unbalance. The father's reason for keeping the girls locked
behind bars for their entire life is that: "My daughters are like
flowers. They mustn't be exposed to the sun or they would soon fade." He
also claims that his blind wife can't watch the children and he must
lock them in or else the girls could get touched by boys and be
dishonored.</P>
<P>This ignorance is bliss tale, a tale with no given solution, seems like
it is a documentary, but instead it mixes fact and fiction, as it adds
setup fictional pieces to its factual story; and, this national story in
Iran, which was widely reported in their media causing a national
scandal, plays here with a dazzling sense of wonderment and complexity.
It was a condemnation of how girls are treated differently than boys,
because the boys would have been allowed to play outside and therefore
would have never been imprisoned. It makes a potent statement about
women's rights in a country where women are seen as inferior, and it
also symbolically calls for more freedom for all people. Samira, now
that she had the consent of the real people involved to film their
story, went right ahead with the project, securing help in the script
and in the editing from her famous and controversial father, as she was
able to shoot this simple story within eleven days. She has made it a
story that calls attention to the ethics for all women in Iran, not
caring how controversial it would seem to the authorities.</P>
<P>Inexcusably, after so much psychological damage has been done, a
petition to the Welfare Department, sent by the neighbors of the Naderi
family, is shown onscreen, and a social worker shows up at their door to
question them, taking the children to the orphanage to wash up and be
interviewed, before deciding what to do with them. They make an
agreement with the parents that the children are not to be locked in
anymore, but must be allowed to play in the street, and the twins are
thusly returned to the parents.</P>
<P>When the social worker visits them again, the children are still locked
up. The social worker then takes action, freeing them to go play in the
streets, while locking the parents inside to let them know how it feels.
The neighbors are seen reacting to the girls on the street and the
social worker's presence, either praising her for bringing the girls
back or wondering why she didn't keep the girls with the Welfare
Department. The girls get into trouble when they try to buy ice cream
from a boy vendor without money and then stealing the ice cream, meeting
a couple of girls who teach them how to play without hitting each other,
and they chase after an apple a playful boy dangles by a string from his
apartment window. The social worker gives the father a hacksaw and tells
him that is the only way he will leave his imprisonment.</P>
<P>What will happen to the girls in the future is anybody's guess. The last
shot of the film, if it is an omen of the future, then it is a scary
one, as the blind woman leaves the house and meets the same playful boy
dangling the apple and ends up chasing the same apple her daughters
chased. Who knows what will happen in Iran, and what fate awaits those
who are blind or have been imprisoned and venture out into the unknown,
but for the teenage filmmaker, that is the only way to go to secure
freedom.</P>
