<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Sylvester Stallone is Jack Carter, someone he tells us we don't want to
know, and you know he's right. This is a pointless B- film actioner, a
remake of the gritty 1971 British noir classic directed by Mike Hodges,
which had the good fortune to have Michael Caine be the star and to have
a story with an edge to it. This "Get Carter" features mindless
violence, an incoherent and uninvolving story, and most unfortunately
the humorless presence of the miscast Stallone as a Vegas mob enforcer,
going to Seattle for the funeral of his bartender brother he hasn't seen
for a long time. He is seeking revenge for his murder. His aim is to
find out who made his brother's death look like a car accident and make
them pay for it. He is dressed in a tacky bright blue suit, sports a
goatee, and speaks in a low voice. It is filmed amid some dazzling night
shots of Las Vegas casinos and shots of a rainy Seattle, though the rain
has no effect on Stallone's suit, it never gets soaked no matter how
much he exposes it to the elements. When Carter threatens someone, he
says it in a serious tone, "This is going to another level." It's a
cliché movie...so predictable, that if you didn't want to see the way
the sleazy bad guys were going to get payback for what they did, you
could have left the theater and figured out which way this macho stylish
film was going by yourself. You would have missed nothing, there is
absolutely nothing interesting about this film. It seems that Stephen
Kay has taken a perfectly taut original film, which was nasty and
unremitting to the core, and made a mess of the remake by trying to
clean it up, making it into a sleazy film, nevertheless, but one with no
redeeming features.</P>
<P>In this poorer version of "Get Carter" the women in Jack's family are
nice instead of the whores they were when they were last filmed in
Northern England. His sister-in-law (Mirand  Richardson) grieves for her
husband and doesn't understand what happened, but doesn't want revenge.
Her daughter Doreen (Leigh Cook) is a sweet girl, who is into being mod,
with pierced jewelry in her nose. She is the innocent girl who was raped
and unwittingly put on videotape by Eddy, someone whom she trusted
because he worked at the same bar as her father. Her father died telling
the mob he was going to the police about this. She is now being
comforted by Carter, who relieves her of all blame and assuages his
guilt for not being there for the family by vowing revenge. He tries to
give the film a moment of acting, hugging his niece in a warm embrace,
as behind her back he grimaces with obvious pain on his teary face,
assuring the audience to pay little attention to this human gesture,
they shouldn't worry, he hasn't gone soft, there's going to be a
payback.</P>
<P>The most disgusting role in the film is reserved for "gazillionaire"
computer geek Alan Cumming, he is the simpering coward, the most unmanly
and therefore the most unseemly one in the film. He plays the
over-the-top role of an obnoxious pansy who got involved in setting up a
porn empire for Cyrus Paice (Mickey Rourke) and is afraid such publicity
would kill his public image as a computer whiz entrepreneur. Cyrus is
pure sleaze (in other words, he's Mickey Rourke), but he's at least
manly in leather and dark glasses, with dumb broads draped around him
wherever he goes. He is the most dangerous and violent of all the
sleazes, the one who gets into a fatal fist fight with Carter. It could
have been built as the battle between the sleaze champ vs. the
egomaniac.</P>
<P>Michael Caine's role is as a lowly club owner of a small place. It's an
undeveloped role, but Caine is so good at getting credibility for his
character, someone who pretends to have nothing to gain from the murder,
who could therefore be honest about what happened, but is, of course,
somehow involved in the cover-up.</P>
<P>There are several other sleazes around, who have various things to add
to the story, such as more gratuitous violence and a seamy look at their
lives. The most noticeable one was from Carter's frenzied partner in the
enforcer business (John C. McGinley), who keeps warning Carter to take
care of business at home (Vegas), or the business will take care of you.
Since Carter fails to heed such warnings, these two will clash in
Seattle. Thankfully we have a car chase between the two besides the
traditional gunplay, which is a break in the relentless monotony of the
film. Anyway, no minor B-thriller should be without such a car chase.</P>
<P>The only positive spin I could put on this morose work, is to say that
it could have been a lot worse, Stallone could have talked in a loud
voice. This is just another in a long list of films since the 1980s to
try and resurrect Sylvester Stallone's "comeback." This picture won't
do. It lacks whatever suspense, character development, and ability to
involve the viewer, that is needed. It only features the ego of Stallone
plodding his way in a shallow story.</P>
<P>If you want to see "Get Carter," rent the 1971 video. It's a nasty
story, but it holds together in purpose and credibility, catching hold
of the downtrodden Newcastle atmosphere in a subtle way, something this
film was never able to realize for Seattle.</P>
