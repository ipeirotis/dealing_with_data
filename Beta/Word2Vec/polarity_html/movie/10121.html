<P>     AMISTAD is no SCHINDLER'S LIST.  Think it unfair if you must, but
Steven Spielberg is going to face comparisons like that for the rest of
his film-making career.  In the case of AMISTAD, those comparisons are
going to be even harder to avoid, given the proximity in time (it's
Spielberg's first "serious" film since the Oscar-winning SCHINDLER in
1993), the subject matter (the trials of an oppressed people) and the
situational familiarity (if it's the December after a Spielberg dinosaur
movie, it must be time for a Spielberg fact-based historical epic).
Spielberg may never make another SCHINDLER'S LIST -- even the most
successful home run hitter isn't likely to knock _two_ World
Series-winning grand slams -- but he did raise his personal bar.  Now that
we know what he's capable of, we're not going to let him get away with
choosing less than stellar material.</P>
<P>     AMISTAD is hardly a half-hearted effort; in fact, there are a couple
of scenes which rank with Spielberg's best work as a director.  It is,
however, a piece of material which ends up providing far less impact than
it should.  The film is based on the true story of an 1840s court case
involving 44 black men and women, led by Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), accused
of piracy for an uprising against their capters on the Spanish slaving
ship "La Amistad."  Found off the coast of Long Island by a U.S. Navy
ship, the blacks become the subject of an intense and controversial series
of legal challenges.  Are they the property of the two surviving members
of the "Amistad" crew?  Are they the property of Queen Isabella (Anna
Paquin)?  Are they the property of the naval officers who claim salvage
rights?  Or are they the property of no one, free men illegally captured
from their homes in Africa?</P>
<P>     It is the latter point which is argued by attorney Roger Baldwin
(Matthew McConaughey), assisted by abolitionists Theodore Joadson (Morgan
Freeman) and Lewis Tappan (Stellan Skarsgaard), with further assistance
from former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins).  Faced with
direct opposition from struggling incumbent President Martin Van Buren
(Nigel Hawthorne, looking even more befuddled than he did in THE MADNESS
OF KING GEORGE) as the case becomes a flashpoint for Southern grumbling
over the slavery issue, Baldwin tries to overcome a profound language gap
and get Cinque to tell his own story.  AMISTAD is at its best when Cinque
is telling his story, allowing the electrifying performance of Djimon
Hounsou to take center stage.  Though he utters only half a dozen English
words through the entire film, Hounsou's impassioned work brings to life
an intelligent man trying to understand a thoroughly perplexing new world.
He is the heart and soul of AMISTAD.</P>
<P>     If it had ever been made clear that AMISTAD is Cinque's story, the
film could have been a masterpiece.  Instead, David Franzoni's script
allows too many characters to flirt with the impression that the story is
all about them.  Freeman, as a former slave turned anti-slavery advocate,
somehow gets first billing despite disappearing for most of the film;
McConaughey plays his noble lawyer from A TIME TO KILL with mutton chops,
but without a sense of what the case means to him; Hopkins'
borderline-senile Adams has little to do before delivering his oration
before the Supreme Court.  Franzoni also tosses off one of the story's
most crucial pieces of historical trivia -- that while slavery was still
legal in 1839, capturing Africans was not -- as though it were common
knowledge.  The "Amistad" case was a messy piece of history, but the
script only serves to make it messier, obscuring the human drama in a
muddle of over-plotting.</P>
<P>     When AMISTAD does give the Africans' plight its undivided attention,
it's a gripping piece of film-making.  As he did with the horror of the
concentration camps, Spielberg provides unflinching images of the horrors
of slave ships without exploiting those horrors.  He also creates a
splendid sequence in which one African's Bible lesson to Cinque is
cross-cut with one man's struggle of Christian conscience.  If only there
had been more of those moments, more singularity of purpose, more
complexity of character.  Spielberg brought in SCHINDLER scribe Steven
Zaillian to do some doctoring on the AMISTAD script, but the doctor
couldn't turn merely good into great.  AMISTAD is a solidly made film.
It's just no...well, you know.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Schindler's ships:  7.</PRE>
