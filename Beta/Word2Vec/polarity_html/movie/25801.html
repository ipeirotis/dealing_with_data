<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A visually stunning serial killer film, with mind-bending special
effects, computer imaging, special F/X, and gorgeous costumes, as
directed by commercial and music-video director Tarsem Singh, in his
debut feature film. The cinematic beauty and originality of this
pioneering visual film hides the banality of the story and the weak
storytelling, as the director doesn't know quite what to do with the
film after setting it up with set designs that are simply breathtaking.
He doesn't know how to close the story or how to keep it suspenseful.
This is an arty serial killer film that is not necessarily an art nor is
it a mainstream film, it's an in-betweener, where what is seen is more
than what there is, which leaves a terrible void when trying to get past
the colorful, disturbing, and enjoyable display of images, and then
deciphering the content. But the visuals are so stimulating, that they
almost cover up all the film's loose ends.</P>
<P>Catherine (Lopez) is a child psychologist, who has a special gift for
getting children to trust her and open up. She is very sensitive to
their hurts and speaks in a hush inflection, showing them much love. She
is currently working with the child (Colton) of a billionaire who is in
a coma. The radical method used is an experimental procedure, which
allows her to become connected with her patient by entering their mind,
where she will communicate with them on a subconscious level, as she and
the patient hang suspended in rust colored vinyl suits. Dr. Miriam Kent
(Jean-Baptiste) and Henry West (Dylan Baker) serve as her supervisors,
backups, and as the research scientists on the project who support her
efforts to enter her patient's mind. The visuals inside the mind are
spectacular images of lunacy and are laced with compelling and original
art designs, all of the images are beautifully colored. In the child's
head, she is dressed as a princess in a white feathered gown, standing
on glistening island sand with a crystal clear sky invading the senses
with an array of brightness, that could be as inviting as a tourist
commercial for travellers, except there is a bizarre quality about these
images that is more than an eyeful for an ad.</P>
<P>Most of the film, is spent taking a mind trip with Catherine as she
explores the subconscious of both this child and of a serial killer,
while the chase of the killer is not particularly interesting, playing a
secondary role to the cinematography of the mind.</P>
<P>Carl Stargher (D'Onofrio) is the psychopathic serial killer, who is
diagnosed with a severe case of a rare schizophrenia. His thing is to
kidnap women and place them in an underground bunker in a Plexiglas cell
with just some food and a toilet. He has the cell setup to videotape
them as he derives great pleasure watching the woman suffer while he has
an automated water system that submerges them after 40 hours of this
mind torture, and when they are dead he dumps their bleached bodies
someplace where they can be easily found. He has just kidnapped Julia
Hickson and has taken her to his secret place, when the FBI, under the
supervision of the workaholic Peter Novak (Vaughn) trace him through his
albino dog and arrest him in his apartment. But he goes into a catatonic
state and can't be awakened to tell them where he is keeping Julia. The
FBI playing against time, desperately ask the experimental scientists to
help them and Catherine agrees to get into the killer's head, even
though this is a more dangerous task than what she usually does.</P>
<P>When Catherine experiences some danger in the killer's head, Peter makes
the experimental journey with her and when he comes back to earth he
finds a clue where the killer got his water system from, and follows
that lead the way the FBI usually doggedly operates. Meanwhile,
Catherine realizes that she is pressed for time to locate the hideout,
so she reverses the process and has the killer enter her mind, which is
perilous since it is easy to lose track of reality this way. A series of
Frances Bacon-like images are conjured up along with a multiple score of
other very artfully manifested designs, including Catherine going into a
mind cell, as she eerily probes the killer's memory bank when he was an
abused child at the hands of his tyrannical father.</P>
<P>The main focus of the film is the visual journey itself, therefore the
actors are mostly asked to blend in and not steal the scenery from the
visuals. It is something they successfully do. Jennifer Lopez is
surprisingly credible as a therapist and the one the film hinges on to
take us on this mind trip, Vince Vaughn plays his low-key role in an
expressively adequate manner, and Vincent D'Onofrio elicits some
sympathy for being a victim of child abuse while also seen as an
over-the-top psycho, someone who is capable of torturing women for no
logical reasons. He is so strange, that he is most comfortable when he
is suspended in air or has hooks sticking in his back. But one is always
reminded that the actors are not as important as the cinematography is,
as the film always returns to the visualizations of the mind to keep the
intensity going. The film had enough visual material to keep you looking
at it and wondering what does it all mean since it wasn't a very
frightening serial killer picture, and its mind explorations did not
take us down some unmarked Jungian trail. It ends up by having the hero
rescue the heroine in the nick of time, allowing the film to wend its
way back into the conventional way serial killer films usually conclude.
Perhaps, with a more razor-sharp story and requiring more from the
capable cast, the film could have lived up to its visualizations and
have been a masterpiece, instead of settling for being an engrossing
film that is very entertaining, a film that certainly sets a new high
standard for photography.</P>
