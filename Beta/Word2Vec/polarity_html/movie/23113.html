<P>If anything, "Stigmata" should be taken as a warning against releasing
similarly-themed films relatively close to one another. Of the four
supernatural horror flicks released this year, it is clearly the worst. I
suppose I should have seen this coming. After all, "Blair Witch" thoroughly
creeped me out, "Sixth Sense" was mildly spooky, and then "Stir of Echoes"
had its moments, but wasn't anything I'd lose sleep over. Clearly, the
quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping. Is it then any
surprise that "Stigmata" is the dullest, most horribly executed piece of
MTV-influenced tripe I have seen in a long while? No, not really.</P>
<P>Patricia Arquette plays Frankie Page, a hairdresser from Pittsburgh who
receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother. As it turns out,
the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased Brazilian priest. The priest's
church had been under investigation by Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne)
because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue. Father Kiernan is
an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious
signs, but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue.
His investigation is soon called off, however, when the Frankie starts
exhibiting signs of the stigmata, in which a person is inflicted with wounds
like that of Jesus Christ. Father Kiernan is initially skeptical of Frankie'
s story, considering she's an atheist, but once he witnesses the stigmata
attacks himself, he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on. He
eventually begins to suspect that his boss, Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan
Pryce), is concealing something that could bring down the Catholic Church.
As it turns out, the dead priest had been working on the translation of a
"fifth gospel" before they were excommunicated.</P>
<P>The new Rupert Wainwright music video . . . I mean film "Stigmata" is the
sort of film that starts off OK and only gets worse. Indeed, it would have
been good if it were a music video, because it's only interesting for about
five minutes. I'm not sure what Wainwright is trying to prove with his
endless parade of slow-motion, double-exposure, and extreme close-ups
(Whoaaaaaa!!!!), other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of
any director in Hollywood and, yes, he has been to film school. His camera
trickery is interesting for a little while, but eventually, it becomes
headache-inducing. What this film needed is a second audio track to be
played over the dialogue (such as it is), with Wainwright screaming at the
audience, "See? Look at what I can do! I'm an EX-cellent dir-ECT-or." Maybe
then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with
slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse, or why he included random
superfluous shots as that of an egg frying (ooh, scary!). If there was some
underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery, I didn't see it. Just
when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story, here comes a
double-exposure shot of two Patricia Arquettes collapsing into bed for no
reason whatsoever. Arrrrrrrghhhh . . .</P>
<P>Then again, the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if "Stigmata"
had a story or characters that were remotely engaging. Though Wainwright's
vanity certainly doesn't help, he does seem to have been given a nearly
unworkable script. Where are plot continuity and character development when
you need them? Case in point: Frankie Page is the character that (I assume)
we are supposed to identify and sympathize with, but we aren't given any
back story on her character, or any reason to like her. The extent of her
character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser
(who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her
building) and she's kind of cute, so let's start the bleeding! The fact that
she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help, either.
According to Frankie Page, what is the first thing to do after receiving
mysterious wounds on your wrists and back? Go clubbing! Sure, that makes
sense. Arquette, Byrne, and Pryce give it the old college try, but their
characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking.
Scenes between Arquette and Byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually
charged fall almost embarrassingly flat, because the setup of the romantic
subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming
laughable. Even though Frankie Page's life is falling apart before her very
eyes, she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair
salon. Even more curiously, he seems to be interested in her advances.
Father Andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly
than dramatic. As for Pryce, he may as well wear a curled mustache and
cackle, "I'll get you, my pretty," for all the depth his Cardinal Houseman
is afforded. Trust me, I'm not revealing anything by telling you Pryce turns
out to be a villain.</P>
<P>What's worse, after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of
having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats, we now
have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction, veers off in
another, then another, and ends up being totally incomprehensible. First of
all, the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot
details. How does Frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary? How
come an atheist like her was chosen, since Father Andrew mentions that only
very devout believers have ever received stigmata? Actually, I'm not sure
what Frankie was posessed by. Supposedly, stigmata occurs when one is
posessed by the Holy Spirit, but the film later has her being posessed by
the dead priest, and later by some evil spirit (I think). Which one is it?
The answer to this question, of course, is very simple: the possessing
entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera
work Mr. Wainwright wants to use this time. Furthermore, the ending is a
ridiculously neat little wrap-up, and the filmmakers compound this problem
by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the Catholic Church.
If you do any research at all about the Gospel of St. Thomas, you'll find
that it is not being suppressed by the Church (as the film seems to claim),
but that it is readily available at your local library. There's nothing the
Catholics need to worry about, though. "Stigmata's" religion is so off-base
that it can't be confused for anything remotely resembling the real Catholic
Church. If they wanted to portray Catholic priests as mobsters, they should
have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns,
which would have been far more interesting. I'm not Catholic; in fact, I don
't care much for the Catholic Church, but its cartoonish misrepresentation
in this film should not be considered realistic by any means.</P>
<P>It's rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as "Stigmata" does. It'
s not thought-provoking, though it would like to be, and it is definitely
not scary, though it pretends to be. I'm not sure why they tried to pass
this off as a horror film, because there is absolutely nothing scary about
the story. Maybe it's an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the
scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever. The initial shock of seeing
Arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over, and
over, and over. Like so many films of the MTV generation, this one suffers
from overkill. So much is overdone in "Stigmata," that it eventually has no
effect on the audience, leaving us to pick out the film's (many) flaws. I'm
also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the Gospel
of St. Thomas is so Earth-shattering. When we finally hear it, the saying
sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of
Sunday School, which means that for all its flash, the whole film is really
much ado about nothing. The dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous
dog, and "Stigmata" is it.</P>
