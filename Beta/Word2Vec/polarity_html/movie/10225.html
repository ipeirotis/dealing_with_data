<P>     Michelle Yeoh is ultimately the best thing about TOMORROW NEVER DIES,
the 18th installment in the phenomenally popular series based on Ian
Fleming's James Bond (Pierce Brosnan).  And in a strange way, she also
points out its most glaring weaknesses.  You see, Bond may be a brand
name, but as I noted in my 1995 review of GOLDENEYE, the franchise no
longer has the market cornered on high-flying, globe-hopping action.  When
the alternatives to the latest Bond adventure include watching the
dazzling Jackie Chan battle international espionage with considerably more
imagination, TOMORROW NEVER DIES starts to look rather bland and
uninspired.  The presence of Yeoh, Chan's capable sidekick in SUPERCOP,
only serves as a reminder that there are new kids on the block.  Brosnan
may look appropriately dapper, but the series just looks old, cruising on
its place in cinematic history.</P>
<P>     The premise has a kind of perfunctory Bond-ian grandiosity about it,
despite an extremely lackluster villain.  Jonathan Pryce plays Elliot
Carver, an international media mogul just about to launch a new satellite
news network.  Operating on the principle that it's easier to create news
than to hunt it down, Carver and his operatives begin making their own
headlines by instigating a conflict between the British navy and China,
one which results in a downed British battleship and talk of war.  Enter
Bond, assigned to determine the dirty details of Carver's operation.  Ably
assisted by Chinese government agent Wai Lin (Yeoh), Bond must stop the
presses before Carver's meddling results in all-out war between England
and China.</P>
<P>     The ho-hum megalomania of Pryce and his obligatory, inhumanly
resilient henchman (Gotz Otto) are only part of an extremely familiar
package which prevents TOMORROW NEVER DIES from ever getting off the
ground.  Token attempts at adding depth to Bond's romantic conquests (he
_really_ cares about old flame Teri Hatcher...no, really, he does) fall
flat, but that's no great surprise.  The real disappointment is the
quality of the action set pieces -- a few flashes of creativity
chaotically directed by Roger Spottiswoode (AIR AMERICA, TURNER AND HOOCH)
to lend the illusion of real energy.  The gunplay is routine, the chases
are routine, even Q's gadgets are routine (a car that drops little spikey
things to flatten the tires of the car behind you...what will he think of
next?).  Even peppering the action with traditional Bond quips doesn't
help, especially when most of the audience is baffled into silence by a
reference to Carver's "edifice complex."</P>
<P>     The only real change of pace is Yeoh, who provides the Bond series
with its best, most exciting leading lady in years (with all due respect
to Maud Adams and Grace Jones).  She's such a match for Bond -- just as
resourceful and even more physically capable -- that it's a shame to see
her reduced to damsel-in-distress status.  Watching Yeoh fly through an
acrobatic martial arts fight sequence conjures images of the more
inventive stunt wizardry of Jackie Chan's films.  Chan has been
out-Bonding Bond for years now, a detail it's hard to overlook while
TOMORROW NEVER DIES is punching and exploding its way through two hours on
automatic pilot.</P>
<P>     Pierce Brosnan once again provides Bond with an appropriate
ruthlessness, but he's also burdened with the anachronistic he-man antics.
Much of the continued appeal of the series can be attributed to the fact
that the more things change, the more James Bond remains the same -- in
the liberated, safe-sex, designated driver 90s, he's still an unabashed
chauvinist who sleeps around, drinks his vodka martinis and kicks ass for
queen and country.  That sense of familiarity may be the series' greatest
financial strength, but it's also its greatest impediment to quality.
Once upon a time, the James Bond series was a bi-annual festival of "can
you top this?"  The goal is simpler now; the producers aren't even trying
to compete with the big-budget big boys.  They rely on one secret weapon
not provided by Q:  nostalgia.  TOMORROW NEVER DIES never once tries to
play "can you top this?"  It's a film content to offer "do you remember
this?"</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Bond futures:  4.</PRE>
