<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An action-packed WW11 film about marines landing on a
Japanese-controlled Pacific Island and overcoming rocket fire while
being badly outnumbered. A more than adequate telling of the
standard-type of 1950s hard-nosed war film, which is helped greatly by
an outstanding cast. Throughout the film, starting at its opening
moments, the patriotic "Halls of Montezuma" song is rousingly played
whenever there is a call for flagwaving. Lewis Milestone, the director
of this ode to war film, was curiously enough, noted for directing in
1930, one of the most reknown anti-war films, All Quiet on the Western
Front.</P>
<P>In "Halls of Montezuma," Milestone emphasizes the lives of the
characters in the battle-tested 2nd Marine Company, rather than the
battle scenes. In some battle scenes, the real documentary war shots are
added to the film action, which gives the film a gritty look.</P>
<P>The respected company leader is Lieutenant Anderson (Widmark), who was a
high school chemistry teacher before the war. He has led these marines
through Guadacanal and his aim is to keep the seven survivors from his
old platoon alive. But there is something noticeably wrong with him; he
is having severe migraines. The film uses a flashback to show how the
medical corpsman (Malden) has known about Anderson's condition for some
time, but he has been asked by him to keep it private, because if the
authorities found out about it, he would be sent home and he wants to
finish the war with his fighting men. The corpsman feeds him pain
killers when the headaches get really bad and he doesn't disclose this
information.</P>
<P>On the boat, before the men land on the beach, Cpl. Conroy (Hylton) asks
Anderson to give him a discharge, that he has cracked after the last
battle and is afraid of the up-coming one. Milestone changes the
voice-tone of Anderson's speech so that we know that what we are now
hearing are his private thoughts. With the aid of flashback, we see that
Anderson while teaching, had a new student come into his class who
stuttered. This was Conroy, who through Anderson's help was able to
overcome his fear of speaking. With this in mind, Anderson convinces
Conroy to not give in to this fear and carry-out his mission. Both
headaches and stuttering are caused, according to Anderson, by fear.</P>
<P>The men when they land on the beach meet little resistance, but when
they try to take a ridge, they are met with machine-gun fire from the
pillboxes above. When they secure their position after heavy casualties,
the men receive orders from the officer in charge of this operation, Lt.
Col. Gilfilan (Boone), that they must capture some Japanese prisoners
rather than trying to kill them as before. The reason is that they are
being attacked by rockets on the island and want to interrogate any
prisoner to see if they can get the location where those rockets are.</P>
<P>The colonel gets Anderson to take his men and a British-born sergeant,
Johnson (Gardiner), who can speak Japanese, to get some Japanese
prisoners hiding in a cave to give up. Of course, the dangers in this
assignment, is that the Japanese prisoner who came to them about where
the soldiers were, might be leading them into an ambush.</P>
<P>The men who distinguish themselves from Anderson's company are all the
typical characters found in these types of films: Robert Wagner is a
radio man loyal to his fellow soldiers; Bert Freed is a tough marine
private who is battle-experienced, but can't behave properly when there
are no battles; Jack Webb is a war correspondent who is writing a book
about the war, and is eager to experience a battle; Neville Brand is a
tough sergeant who gets blinded, but still believes he is doing the
right thing by fighting for his country; Skip Homeier is a troubled boy
who doesn't want to be a nobody and is a little bit gun crazy, who
joined the marines to become a man; Jack Palance is a boxer in civilian
life, who is grateful that Skip saved his life and tries to straighten
the kid out; and, Karl Malden who gets fatally shot and writes a
patriotic letter that he wants read to the men, stating that America's
cause is just and that God is on America's side.</P>
<P>The Japanese are de-humanized, as they are routinely called Nips and the
officers say, "A good Jap, is a dead one." The film doesn't pretend to
be more than a routine WW11 war film reflecting the political mood of
when it was made, that should be pleasing for those who like
simple-minded action flicks. It is well-crafted by Milestone's
even-handed direction and it ably presents the characters of the men and
lets the story build in action after a slow start, so that when some of
the men die, you at least know who they were.</P>
