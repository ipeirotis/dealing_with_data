<P>     The Catholic community's outcry against PRIEST has already begun, 
and it will doubtlessly become more intense before it abates.  One of the 
most disturbing elements of any organized protest of this sort is that 
most of those involved will not have seen the picture in question.  
Another equally unfortunate byproduct is that, as was the case with THE 
LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, the movie itself may get lost somewhere in the 
resulting polarization.  If that happens, it will be a shame, because 
PRIEST has a lot to say, and doesn't deserve to be hamstrung by those who 
miss the point or have no idea what they're talking about. </P>
<P>     The main character is Father Greg Pilkington (Linus Roache), a
by-the-book, straightlaced Roman Catholic priest who is new to a rural 
parish in Great Britain.  Father Greg is the sort who believes his job is 
to give moral advice, not act as a social activist--a charge he levels 
against fellow priest Father Matthew Thomas (Tom Wilkinson).   </P>
<P>     While trying to serve his flock, however, Father Greg has his own 
personal demons to wrestle.  Not only is he unable to keep his vow of 
celibacy, he breaks it with another man--something many of his less
tolerant parishioners would surely view as an "abomination" if they 
learned of it.  Even as he struggles with his sexual identity and its 
implications, Father Greg is forced to endure an additional crisis of 
faith when a fourteen year old girl (Christine Tremarco) comes to him 
under the seal of confession and admits to being sexually molested by her 
father. </P>
<P>     There is nothing in PRIEST that hasn't appeared in recent newspaper 
accounts, which makes the Catholic League's opposition to the film 
somewhat ludicrous, not to mention hypocritical.  Perhaps they feel 
threatened by PRIEST's depiction of men of the cloth as flawed human 
beings rather than as icons.  Certainly, the men who don the collar here 
are not perfect, but neither are they lunatics, Epicureans, or devils. </P>
<P>     Jimmy McGovern's script does an excellent job of dovetailing the two 
main elements of the film--Greg's homosexuality and Lisa's sexual
abuse--into a compelling whole, often using unexpected bursts of humor to 
keep the level of tension from becoming too intense.  Arguably, the more 
stirring story centers on the priest's battles with his conscience over 
how to help Lisa, but this film wouldn't have the same emotional 
resonance without the other pieces.  In fact, the final scene 
incorporates several threads into a moment that, while perhaps a little 
overdone, is nonetheless powerful.   </P>
<P>     PRIEST addresses both social and religious themes.  At its core, 
however, is the question of absolute certainty versus faith.  There is, 
of course, no answer to most of the questions that Greg agonizes over, 
but these--such as how Christ could expect him to keep silent when that 
silence condemns a girl to continued suffering--are presented for the 
audience's consideration.  It is by his reaction to the issues that 
Greg's true character is slowly revealed.  It doesn't take long for us to 
realize that our first impression of the man is as false as his facade. </P>
<P>     Linus Roache gives a multi-layered portrayal of Father Greg, 
presenting a character we can accept equally as a spiritual advisor and 
as the tortured man beneath the collar.  Tom Wilkinson is more 
understated, but no less real, at Father Matthew, the older priest who 
accepts Greg's confidences without judging him.  Christine Tremarco is 
chillingly believable as Lisa, and Robert Pugh radiates menace as her 
father--a man who gives a horrifyingly logical explanation for his 
activities.   </P>
<P>     Provocative films like PRIEST rarely arrive without creating some 
sort of controversy.  By not compromising her vision (which is similar to 
that of fellow British film maker Ken Loach), director Antonia Bird has 
fashioned a picture that not only stirs up a hornet's nest of timely and 
volatile spiritual issues, but faces up to homosexuality and incest with 
a frankness which few films dare.  PRIEST is effective not only because 
of all the ground it traverses, but because the final turn brings closure 
without excess. </P>
