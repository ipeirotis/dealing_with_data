<P>     GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE suffers from a fundamental, insurmountable split
personality:  it wants both to be a big, dumb comedy for 8-year-olds and
to make fun of the fact that it is a big, dumb comedy for 8-year-olds.
The former is fairly easy, particularly for Disney, whose recent
contributions like JUNGLE2JUNGLE and D(whatever integer the MIGHTY DUCKS
series is up to lately) make you wonder why they don't just spin off a
live-action banner called Big Dumb Comedies for 8-Year-Olds Pictures.  The
latter, however, requires subtlety...finesse..a keen sense of how far is
just far enough.</P>
<P>     Now that you have lifted yourself off the floor from convulsions of
laughter, I'll confirm your suspicions that GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE does not
represent the Platonic form of subtlety, finesse, or a keen sense of how
far is just far enough.  The adventures of inept jungle king George
(Brendan Fraser), including his romance with dizzy heiress Ursula Stanhope
(Leslie Mann) and his rescue of his friend Ape the talking ape (voice of
John Cleese) from poachers Max (Greg Cruttwell) and Thor (Abraham
Benrubi), are the stuff of which most youth-oriented films in the 90s are
made.  There are some moderately diverting special effects, including a
tree-trunk-fetching elephant named Shep (computer-generated courtesy Dream
Quest Images).  There are pratfalls and comic brawls a-plenty.  And there
are at least 475 separate gags involving either a) flatulence, b)
excrement, c) urine or d) injuries or the threat of injury to the male
gonads.</P>
<P>     All of which works just fine on its own level, except that
screenwriters Dana Olsen and Audrey Wells then feel obliged to get
meta-conscious on us.  Most films of this stripe would be perfectly
comfortable simply serving up a scene where a nasty character like
Ursula's erstwhile fiance Lyle Van de Groot (Thomas Haden Church) falls
face first into a steaming elephant pile.  This one has a native guide
observe:  "Villain falls into pile of poop...a classic element of physical
comedy!"  It's tough to take a film seriously as a wry commentary on its
own excesses, especially when those excesses are the main reason the
majority of the audience is watching.</P>
<P>     GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE's attempts at something resembling
sophistication and wit, half-hearted though they may be, are clearly an
attempt to capture the spirit of the animated namesake created by Jay Ward
(of "Rocky and Bullwinkle" fame).  They also demonstrate a radical
misunderstanding of what was amusing about Ward's efforts.  Like "Rocky
and Bullwinkle," "George of the Jungle" was smart satire rich with
exaggerated word-play.  It also featured a lunk-headed hero played
completely straight, a far jungle cry from the sensitive noble savage
served up by Brendan Fraser.  Fraser is appealing in a goofy-naive way,
but he's a classic Disney-fication:  they've taken a mockery of heroes and
turned him into a hero.  There's nothing to connect this GEORGE OF THE
JUNGLE to Jay Ward's "George of the Jungle" except the theme song, which
is probably the one thing most people will remember about the animated
series.  Those who remember more may be hoping for more than this
predictable kiddie matinee posing as savvy family entertainment.</P>

<PRE>"'Elitist' [is] a word _meaningless_ in a profession that tries to seek
out and spotlight the best.  'Elite' is from the Old French root eslire,
to choose, and choosing is what a critic does for a living.  Calling a
critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist.'"
