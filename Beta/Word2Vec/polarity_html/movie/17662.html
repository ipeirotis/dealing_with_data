TANGO (director:Carlos Saura;  cast: Miguel Angel Sola (Mario Suarez),
Cecilia Narova (Laura Fuentes), Mia Maestro (Elena Flores) Juan Carlos
Copes (Carlos Nebbia), Carlos
 Rivarola (Ernesto Landi), Julio Bocca (as himself), Juan Luis Galiardo
(Angelo Larroca), 1998-Argentinia/Spain)</P>
<P>Tango is a romantic musical, supposedly influenced by Fellini's 8 1/2,
with political overtones to its otherwise almost mirthful mood, that is,
for a Saura film. He brings back memories of the generals of 1976
Argentina and their overthrow of the legitimate government, emphasizing
in one skit, how so many people just disappeared during that regime, by
showing bodies thrown into a mass grave, giving the film a jolt of
terrifying and evocative fear, that brings about an abrupt but temporary
shift of mood. Saura accomplishes his musical numbers with a rather
terse storyline, which means that if you don't care for the tango, you
could find yourself  bored with this slow-moving story. What is
exceptional about this film, is how superbly choreographed and
stunningly colorful and visionary a spectacle it is, as its
cinematographer is the great Vittorio Storaro (LAST TANGO IN PARIS).
Saura captures the passion of the tango, using Mario (Sola) as his
alter-ego to hold his story together. One of the tango masters, explains
to us that the tango is excellently done when experienced dancers can
perform it, so there is one body and four legs in motion.</P>
<P>Mario is in his opulently decorated apartment, recovering from a broken
leg in a car accident, as the film opens, despondent that his wife Laura
(Cecilia) has left him for another man, presumably a younger man (as far
as I could tell, Mario must be somewhere in his forties). He is busy at
his desk preparing a film that he is directing about the history of
Argentina, starting at the turn of the century. In his vivid
imagination, he intercuts what is currently happening to him with how he
saw things as a child and with what the film he is directing will be
about. All this imagining leaves the audience trying to figure out what
is real and what is illusionary, as the story revolves around his
tremendous passion for the tango and his need to be with a woman who
shares his zest for life, as he wonders if his life has been meaningful.</P>
<P>He meets a 23-year-old novice dancer, through a gangster, Angelo
(Galiardo), who happens to be her live-in boyfriend, and as the main
backer of the film, he requests Mario try her out for a part in the
film. He falls in love with her, and is concerned but not relenting,
when she tells him that if she leaves Angelo, he threatened to do harm
to her. With Elena in the picture, he seems to be over carrying the
torch for his ex-wife.</P>
<P>There is lots of innovative dancing and, by Mario, there is lots of deep
brooding thought about life and what must go into the film to make it
arty. We see see a wind machine and the next thing we see is a sultry
tango being performed, sets are designed out of seemingly thin air,
there are color filters for dance numbers created on the spot, a WEST
SIDE STORY look alike number is shown with all male dancers.</P>
<P>The dancing is good enough to carry this film alone. The tango is danced
with passion by everyone, especially graceful were the two women stars
and the great tango dancer Julio Bocca. But the story, that's another
story, it just didn't seem that important, including the nebulous
surprise ending, which in actuality, detracted even further from the
slight storyline. The only scene of dialogue that I thought was really
well-done, was when Mario was on a dinner date with Elena and was trying
to explain and sell himself to her, telling her how he thought like a
young man. He was eventually able to do this, by just being himself,
after trying to use a few far-fetched analogies, comparing men to women,
that didn't seem to go over with her.</P>
<P>The mood the musical numbers set was so convincingly dreamlike, that for
someone like me, who was born with two left feet, I felt like going to a
ballroom and trying this elegant dance, even if I never danced the tango
before.The dancing remains in my head, and that is what cinema can do to
you when it is so stunning to behold.</P>
