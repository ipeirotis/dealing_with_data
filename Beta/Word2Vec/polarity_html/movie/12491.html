<P>     For its first two-thirds, Agnes Merlet's ARTEMISIA is a fine 
examination of the process of creating art and the inextricable (if 
sometimes tenuous) link that binds it to sexuality.  However, while the 
movie's final half-hour is adequate as a melodrama, its conformance to 
certain expectations of the "historical romance" genre robs it of the 
vitality that characterizes the early portions of the film.  As a 
result, although ARTEMISIA is an engaging and occasionally fascinating 
motion picture, it is not a landmark cinematic biography.</P>
<P>     Born on July 8, 1593 in Rome, during and era when many professions 
were forbidden to women, Artemisia Gentileschi was one of the first 
female painters to make a living as an artist.  In the immediate 
centuries following her death, her work was largely-forgotten, only to 
be re-discovered in the last forty years.  Her best-known painting, 
"Judith Beheading Holophernes," was completed in 1612, and has often 
been cited as one of the most passionate and proficient works of art 
crafted by a woman during the seventeenth century.  Today, Artemisia's 
surviving canvasses are recognized throughout the West, and several of 
them reside in the Louvre.</P>
<P>     Merlet's speculative treatment of a chapter in Artemisia's life 
(many of the actual details from the period are unknown, so the film 
maker is able to fashion her own interpretation of the historical 
record) begins in 1610, the year when her artistic urges become too 
powerful to suppress, and ends in 1612, after a rape trial separates her 
from her mentor and lover, Agostino Tassi.  Tassi, an artist working 
with Artemisia's father, Orazio, in painting a series of religious 
frescos, agreed to teach Artemisia after the girl's request for 
admission to the males-only Academy of Fine Arts was rejected.  Their 
relationship, which improved Artemisia's understanding of the technical 
aspects of painting, eventually turned sexual, and led to Tassi's arrest 
on rape charges.</P>
<P>     Italian-born Valentina Cervi (PORTRAIT OF A LADY) plays the lead 
character with the right mix of innocence and sensuality.  As essayed in 
this film, Artemisia is a brilliant, headstrong, passionate woman whose 
tribulations made her a better artist.  Cervi's portrayal is stunning, 
giving us another young international actress who is as talented as she 
is beautiful.  Appearing opposite Cervi is Miki Manojlovic, whose 
interpretation of Tassi is that of an older man hopelessly enraptured by 
a woman who should remain forbidden to him.  Rounding out the main cast 
is veteran French actor Michel Serrault (LA CAGE AUX FOLLES, NELLY & M. 
ARNAUD), who brings an air of quiet dignity to his performance as 
Orazio.</P>
<P>     It's debatable how accurate Merlet's treatment of Artemisia's 
affair with Tassi is (the surviving court records of the rape trial 
indicate that it was a somewhat less romantic liaison than is presented 
here), but it makes for a compelling story.  Especially noteworthy are 
the scenes in which Tassi instructs Artemisia about the techniques of 
art, reigning in her natural passion and allowing her to harness a 
burgeoning talent.  Tassi is presented as a volatile man who loves his 
student as much as his craft.  Artemisia's fascination with sex and the 
naked male body leads to an ever-present subtext about the relationship 
between eroticism and art -- a subject that has fascinated scholars and 
laymen alike throughout history.  In the context of this film, it not 
only impels the narrative, but captures and holds the viewer's 
attention.  With ARTEMISIA,  Merlet paints a beautiful and intriguing, 
if somewhat incomplete, picture.</P>
