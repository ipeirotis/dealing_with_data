<P>     Saving dolphins is good.  Dumping toxic waste in the ocean is bad.  
Those are the two fundamental messages hammered home by the latest 
lamebrained incarnation of FLIPPER, a movie that has a lot of good 
intentions, but very little else.  This most recent in the series of 
neverending variations on the LASSIE storyline might serve as adequate 
entertainment for undiscriminating children, but, for adults, it's a 
gargantuan waste of time and money.  </P>
<P>     Once, when CROCODILE DUNDEE topped the box office charts, Paul 
Hogan was as hot as could be.  Now, ten years and several failed 
pictures later, his star has fallen so far that the best he can do is 
play second fiddle to a dolphin.  Unhappily for the Australian star, his 
performance here isn't likely to appreciably increase his stock.  
FLIPPER is bad, and Hogan certainly doesn't redeem the film.</P>
<P>     Based on the 1963 movie which spawned a television series, FLIPPER 
has all the formula ingredients that saturate '90s family films.  It's a 
cloying mixture that threatens a cuteness overdose.  There isn't a 
moment of originality in this movie, which follows a routine path from 
start to finish.  Like the whale in the far better FREE WILLY, the 
animal steals the show.  </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, Flipper doesn't have a whole lot to do except swim 
around and execute leaps.  The two-legged landlubbers get most of the 
screen time, and they're pretty uninteresting.  There's Sandy Ricks 
(NORTH's Elijah Wood), the son of a broken marriage who's sent to spend 
a summer in the Florida Keys living with his uncle, Porter (Hogan).  
Initially, the two don't get along well -- Sandy is surly and doesn't 
take kindly to his uncle's lessons of responsibility.  Then Flipper 
shows up, giving Sandy something to care about other than himself.  The 
dolphin also gets him a girlfriend and helps uncover the dastardly deep 
sea waste dumping of a nasty fisherman (Jonathan Banks).</P>
<P>     About the only worthwhile thing FLIPPER offers is some decent 
underwater photography, but those in search of these kinds of marine 
views would do better checking out a National Geographic special on PBS.  
The film is intended to appeal to the under-12 crowd, but I have a hard 
time recommending it even for them.  FLIPPER is calculated, market-
driven entertainment -- recycled formulas staking out the early summer 
family film niche in hopes of making money.  With better children's fare 
on the way, including the inevitable new animated feature from Disney, 
it's a good idea to throw this one back.</P>
