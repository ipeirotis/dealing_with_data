<P>     In essence, GOOD WILL HUNTING is an ordinary story told well.  
Taken as a whole, there's little that's special about this tale -- it 
follows a traditional narrative path, leaves the audience with a warm, 
fuzzy feeling, and never really challenges or surprises us.  But it's 
intelligently written (with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant), 
strongly directed, and nicely acted.  So, while GOOD WILL HUNTING is far 
from a late-year masterpiece, it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment.</P>
<P>     Like SCENT OF A WOMAN, which was released around this time of the 
season five years ago, GOOD WILL HUNTING is about the unlikely 
friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young 
man.  The formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals 
learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the 
way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the 
characters are different.  Al Pacino's Slade was a larger-than-life 
individual; Robin Williams' Sean McGuire is much more subtle.  And Matt 
Damon's Will Hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of 
Chris O'Donnell's Charlie.  </P>
<P>     Will is a troubled individual.  As a child, he was the frequent 
victim of abuse.  An orphan, he was in and out of foster homes on a 
regular basis.  Now, not yet 21 years old, he has accumulated an 
impressive rap sheet.  He has a short temper and any little incident can 
set him off like a spark in a tinder box.  But he's a mathematical 
genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple 
solutions to complex problems.  While working as a janitor at MIT, he 
delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building's hall 
blackboards.  Then, one evening, his anonymity is shattered when 
Professor Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) catches him at work.  Will flees, 
but Lambeau tracks him down.  Unfortunately, by the time the professor 
finds him, Will is in jail for assaulting a police offer.</P>
<P>     The judge agrees to release Will under two conditions:  that he 
spend one day a week meeting with Lambeau and that he spend one day a 
week meeting with a therapist.  Eventually, once several psychologists 
have rejected the belligerent young man, Sean McGuire, a teacher at 
Bunker Hill Community College, agrees to take the case.  After a rocky 
start, the two form a rapport and Will begins to explore issues and 
emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor.  And, as Will 
advances his self-awareness in sessions with Sean, he also learns about 
friendship from his buddy, Chuckie (Ben Affleck), and love from a 
Harvard co-ed named Skylar (Minnie Driver).</P>
<P>     The script, by co-stars Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, is not a 
groundbreaking piece of literature, and occasionally resorts to 
shameless manipulation.  The characters are well-developed, however, and 
there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles.  At one point, 
Will comments that a session with Sean is turning into a "Taster's 
Choice Moment."  Later, Will gives a brilliant, breathless diatribe 
against the NSA that has the rhythm of something written by Kevin Smith.  
(Note:  Since Smith co-executive produced GOOD WILL HUNTING, it's not 
out of the question that he had some input into this scene.)</P>
<P>     Director Gus Van Sant (DRUGSTORE COWBOY, TO DIE FOR) culls genuine 
emotion from his actors, and this results in several affecting and 
powerful scenes.  There's an edginess to some of the Sean/Will therapy 
sessions, and the offscreen chemistry between Matt Damon and Minnie 
Driver (who became romantically linked while making this film) 
translates effectively to the movie -- the Will/Skylar relationship is 
electric.  Likewise, the companionability of Damon and Affleck is 
apparent in the easygoing nature of Will and Chuckie's friendship.  Many 
of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn GOOD WILL HUNTING a 
recommendation, even if the overall story is somewhat generic.</P>
<P>     Matt Damon, who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in 
THE RAINMAKER, is solid (although not spectacular) as Will.  Minnie 
Driver (last seen in GROSSE POINTE BLANK) adds another strong 
performance to a growing resume (and it's refreshing that she was 
allowed to keep her British accent rather than having to attempt an 
American one).  The outstanding performance of the film belongs to Robin 
Williams, whose Sean is sad and wise, funny and somber.  Arguably the 
best dramatic work in the actor's career (alongside what he did in THE 
FISHER KING), Williams' portrayal could earn him a Best Supporting Actor 
Oscar nomination.  Adequate support is provided by Ben Affleck (CHASING 
AMY) and Stellan Skarsgard (BREAKING THE WAVES).</P>
<P>     Like most of what comes before it, the ending of GOOD WILL HUNTING 
is completely predictable.  But meeting expectations and following a 
familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie, provided the film 
accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to 
detail.  GOOD WILL HUNTING does both, and, as a result, earns a rating 
commensurate with the "good" in the title.</P>
