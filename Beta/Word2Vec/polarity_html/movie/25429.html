<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>I was never a comic book fan, though as a child I was a casual reader of
such comics as Archie, Batman, and Superman. I have never read X-Men,
which was created in 1963, or for that matter too many other comic books
as an adult, and therefore do not view this $75 million special-effects
dominated film with the same reverence that an aficionado of such sci-fi
fantasy comics would. I'm just interested to see how Fox's new
comics-to-film adaptation presents itself, as I found very few such
projects turn out to be worthwhile films. The results here are only
tepid, as far as entertainment value goes.  Other than that, I had no
interest to see if the filmmaker made a travesty of the sacred comic
book, as I'm certain X-Men geeks will carefully scrutinize that aspect
of the film more than I will care to.</P>
<P>Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects"/"Apt Pupil") adapts the best-selling
Marvel comic books about a team of mutant heroes battling evil mutants
and human prejudice. It is a commercial film, geared to be a summer
blockbuster, also hoping to cash in on selling its merchandising wares
to its young fans, and cashing in down the road with a number of
sequels.</P>
<P>its realistic take on racism, and its moralistic displeasure at the
futility of world leaders to bring peace to the world. Its special
effects were, at times, dazzling, but I'm not partial to high tech films
without too much else going for it, especially for a superhero film that
seemed as awkward as this one was. I only ask: Why was the filmmaker so
sober-minded about filming this comic book story film?</P>
<P>It just never seemed to get much off the ground, except in its wise
casting decisions of Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier and Ian McKellen
as Magneto, longtime friends who will oppose each other as mutants who
have a different take on the world. Their roles as hero and heavy (which
the producer/writer DeSanto says is based on Xavier as Martin Luther
King Jr. and Magneto as Malcolm X), become the glue that holds this
amorphous, sticky film together. What seems tiring about it, is all the
other characters in the film who are given quality time and end up just
showing us their supernatural gifts and Halloween-like costumes before
disappearing from any further characterizations. The story, before it
reached its action climax on the Statue of Liberty at Ellis Island,
where the world leaders are convening, hit a lot of tired spots, where
the movie seemed to be more or less a promo for more sequels than one
that could sustain its own story.</P>
<P>The premise of X-Men is -- that its heroes are mutants -- homo superior
beings -- the next evolutionary stage for human beings, who are
discriminated against because they're strange. A mutant is a superior
human being through the process of evolution, someone who is born with
superhuman powers --ex., telekinesis (the ability to move objects by
thought), telepathy (the ability to read minds), or the ability to fly.
The U.S. Government wants to have access to those who have an
"X-Factor," the DNA gene that holds the code that gives them mutant
powers.</P>
<P>Ultra-conservative Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) leads his shrill
charge against the mutants (reminiscent of the Senator McCarthy witch
hunt days) and wants to enact a Mutant Registration Act to register all
mutants so that the government could keep an eye on them. Arguing
against this on the floor of the Senate, is Dr. Jean Grey (Famke), one
of the good mutants, someone who has strong telepathic and telekinetic
powers: She can lift a tank by concentrating on it. She is part of the
wheelchair bound Professor Charles Xavier's group, that fights for the
civil rights of the mutants. Xavier is in charge of a Westchester, New
York-based School for Gifted Youngsters, which is also a front for the
superhuman threats. He has a dream that some day he can live in a world
where mutants and humans coexist in peace, he even wants peace with
Magneto, the main enemy to his group. Magneto is a best friend of
Xavier's who has turned arch-enemy. He is the only other person in the
world who shares the same supernatural powers (you could see the analogy
drawn between the Bible's Devil and God).</P>
<P>The plot of the film is simply to see how Xavier's team stops Magneto's
evil team from destroying the world.</P>
<P>Xavier might be the most powerful mutant on Earth. He not only can read
thoughts, but he can project his thoughts into others. He can also alter
and erase memories. With Magneto's help, he created a device called the
Cerebo, which can amplify his mental powers, so he can detect and find a
mutant anywhere in the world. He directs these powers only for the good
of mankind.</P>
<P>Magneto is a survivor of Poland's Auschwitz in 1944, where he has
witnessed so much  human tragedy and now his specific goal is revenge
against anti-mutant bigots, whose better type of hatred elevates him
above the ordinary movie villain. He has formed a Brotherhood of Evil
Mutants to take over the world and is willing to kill anyone to achieve
his goal. His motto is: "by any means necessary." By going out of
control, he moves beyond the pale of goodness and becomes as dangerous
as the enemies he is going after.</P>
<P>For most of the film, we are introduced to the opposing sides of this
good versus evil duel.
On Magneto's side are Mystique (Romijn-Stamos). She's a human chameleon;
she can transform herself into the likeness of any person, despite her
blue skin and red hair. She also possesses superior martial-arts skills.
Toad (Ray Park) is one of the original evil mutants of Magneto's. He can
scale walls and has a 12-foot projectile tongue. He's a regular ass
kicker and tongue-flinging psychopath. Sabertooth (Tyler
Moore-six-feet-ten-inch, 275-pound former wrestler with the WWF) has
similar powers to the hero of the story Wolverine (Hugh
Jackman-Australian). He has healing powers and heightened senses. He is
the scariest of the villains, with a blood lust equal to that of a
vampire. He is extremely athletic and has razor-sharp claws, and loves
to kill.</P>
<P>On Xavier's team, Cyclops (Marsden) is the first recruit. He doesn't
smoke, drink, or curse. He unfurls from his eyes thunderbolts of energy,
which can kill and penetrate steel, and he has to wear a wraparound
ruby-red-quartz visor to keep those rays in check. Storm (Halle Berry)
can control the weather. She can shoot lightning bolts from her hands.
She also dons a stunning platinum wig. Wolverine is a hothead, a loner,
and the existential hero of this film. He suffers because he can't even
remember his family name. He is a difficult person to come to grips with
because of his bellicose nature. He can heal himself from almost any
mortal injury, has heightened senses, is superstrong, and his bones are
composed of an unbreakable metal called adamantum. His claws project out
rapidly from his knuckles and can cut through almost anything. By his
sense of smell, he can tell where someone stood in a room, even days
later. Rogue (Paquin) is a teenager who can touch someone and absorb all
their memories and abilities and their personality. She discovers the
gift she has, when she kisses a boy and puts him in a coma for three
months. There is also a minor role for Iceman (Bobby Drake), he is one
of the gifted school children, who when he speaks, small amounts of
frost emanate from his mouth.</P>
<P>The comic book's loyal followers might want to know: Will Wolverine ever
recall his heritage? Will Rogue recover her full powers? Will the X-Men
continue to share Xavier's vision for a harmonious world?</P>
<P>It is obvious that Singer developed a love for this comic book story and
its mutants, but he failed to distance himself from it and ended up with
a ponderous, uninteresting film, that failed to get to the heart of any
character in the story, and left the story hanging by its special
effects, which made the film seem dried out long before its action
scenes took hold. It was only mildly diverting as far as entertainment
value and that is because of the welcomed hammy performances by Stewart
and McKellen. I'm sure that regular fans of the comic book will find
some inside jokes in the film to laugh at, but I just tended to grow
weary of the effort and was not converted to the X-Men project. The film
needed a healthy share of irreverence to rev me up for all this
righteously moralistic stuff it lays on you.</P>
