<PRE>                                  THE SNAPPER
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Colm Meaney, Tina Kellegher, Ruth McCabe, Pat Laffan.
Screenplay:  Roddy Doyle.
Director:  Stephen Frears.</P>
<P>     Television has given the term "situation comedy" a bad name, but
that might be the most appropriate epithet for THE SNAPPER.  This
bright and earthy comedy from Roddy Doyle (THE COMMITMENTS) deals with
an average Irish family coping with one of life's many little
difficulties.  There's no high concept, no men in drag or mistaken
identities.  THE SNAPPER is just remarkably adept at making the mundane
comic, at making us laugh at real life.  Thanks largely to Colm
Meaney's charming lead performance, it's just one of the most purely
enjoyable comedies of 1993.</P>
<P>     THE SNAPPER is Irish slang for a baby, which is exactly what
Barrytown, Dublin resident Sharon Curley (Tina Kellegher) is
expecting.  The one small complication:  twenty-year-old Sharon is
unmarried.  Her parents Dessie (Colm Meaney) and Kay (Ruth McCabe) are
more than understanding, but they don't understand why Sharon won't
reveal the father's name.  Her reluctance becomes clearer when George
Burgess (Pat Laffan), a paunchy, married neighbor and the father of one
of Sharon's friends, drunkenly announces that Sharon was "a good
ride."  Sharon denies that George is the father, insisting instead on a
one-night stand with a Spanish sailor, but soon all of Barrytown is
abuzz with the gossip, causing great consternation in the Curley
household.</P>
<P>     With such a simple premise, execution becomes paramount, and THE
SNAPPER is very well-executed.  Director Stephen Frears (DANGEROUS
LIAISONS, HERO) keeps the comedy human by concentrating on faces and
reactions, a technique used most effectively during pub scenes where
extreme close-ups of drunken individuals emphasizes distorted
perceptions.  These are loud and boisterous characters (a bit
excessively so in the case of Sharon's cackling clique), and Frears
allows this liveliness to permeate the film.  Without resorting to
location cityscapes, Frears creates a rich atmosphere peopled with
sparkling characters.</P>
<P>     The standout among those characters is Colm Meaney's Dessie.
Dessie is a unique creation, a loving father and husband who avoids the
slew of cliches typical of Irish characters and father characters in
general.  Yes, he enjoys his pint at the pub with the boys, but he's
also attuned to modern sensibilities.  "Times have changed," he tells
Sharon in one scene.  "When Craig was born, I was at work; when you
were born, I was at work; when Lisa was born, I don't know where I
was."  Meaney is perfect, playing a more nuanced version of the same
character he played in THE COMMITMENTS.  His moments with Sharon are
wonderfully warm, even through his frustration at the embarrassment her
condition has caused him; particularly good is a brief, low-key scene
as Dessie shares with Sharon his amazement at the contents of a book on
sexuality.  He's also a man who genuinely loves his wife, and you never
doubt for a moment that Dessie and Kay have been married for
twenty-five years.  It's a performance unlikely to garner much
attention for award nominations, but its as deserving of honors as any
work out there.</P>
<P>     The rest of the cast is a bit more uneven.  Ruth McCabe is equal
to Meaney as the acerbic mother Kay, playing good cop to Dessie's bad
cop.  Tina Kellegher is fine when she's toned down, but when she gets
fiery she gets annoying.  Even more so is Fionnuala Murphy as Sharon's
best friend Jackie.  Pat Laffan's George Burgess is a small role, but
he does quite a lot with it, making George a rather pathetic figure.
Generally, THE SNAPPER is better when it's not in the pub, and the
volume knob on the characters is turned down.</P>
<P>     Some viewers may be made uncomfortable by the circumstances
surrounding Sharon's sexual encounter, but I found the story depended
on those circumstances, and that Sharon's response to her situation
defined her character.  THE SNAPPER doesn't moralize, it just sets up a
scenario and lets characters react.  I found those reactions extremely
funny, although I needed to break out my Irish- to-American profanity
dictionary on more than one occasion.  You'll need to play close
attention to pick up all the dialogue in THE SNAPPER, but it will be
well worth the effort.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 snappers:  8.</PRE>
