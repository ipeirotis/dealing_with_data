<P>     In JALSAGHAR, director Satyajit Ray examines the age-old conflict 
between the landed nobility and the unpedigreed rich, between those who 
dwell in the past and those who embrace the future.  Using the same 
meticulous, unforced style employed in his celebrated APU TRILOGY, Ray 
explores how one man's need for a pampered, sumptuous lifestyle leads 
inexorably towards his complete ruin.  It's a fascinating snapshot of 
Indian culture in the 1930s, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of 
an inflated opinion of self-worth.</P>
<P>     Ray filmed JALSAGHAR between the second (APARAJITO) and third (APUR 
SANSAR) chapters of the APU TRILOGY.  After spending two films (PATHER 
PANCHALI, APARAJITO) providing an intimate perspective of the struggles 
of a poverty-stricken family, Ray moved to the other end of the social 
spectrum, to those who lived in palaces, commanded legions of servants, 
and threw lavish parties.  Tragedy, of course, has no respect for class, 
and losses are suffered by both Apu and the lead character of JALSAGHAR, 
Huzar Biswambhar Roy (Chhabi Biswas).  Their reactions to these crushing 
circumstances are predictably different -- the resilient Apu fights on; 
the pampered Huzar gives up.</P>
<P>     When JALSAGHAR opens, Huzar is an old, beaten man.  Life no longer 
holds any joy for him.  He sits on the roof of his palatial estate, 
smoking and staring into space.  He doesn't know the month or the 
season, and doesn't express much interest when he's told what they are.  
He is surrounded by faithful retainers, but seems unconcerned when they 
inform him that his "funds are low and expenses are heavy."</P>
<P>     The first half of the film shows, via flashback, the circumstances 
that brought Huzar to his present condition.  As a much younger man, he 
was a libertine, enjoying life to its fullest.  To indulge his passion 
for music, he had a jalsaghar, or music room, constructed within his 
palace where he could hold large parties and enjoy the singing, playing, 
and dancing of paid performers.  The music room is a large chamber, with 
gorgeous, crystal chandeliers, a giant mirror at one end, and pictures 
of Huzar's ancestors decorating the walls.</P>
<P>     Heedless of the alarming rate at which his debts piled up, Huzar 
seized any excuse to throw a party, especially if it could inconvenience 
and show up his wealthy but poorly-bred neighbor, Mahim Ganguly 
(Gangapada Bose).  As an indirect result of one of these parties, 
Huzar's wife (Padma Devi) and son (Pinaki Sen Gupta) were killed in a 
boating accident.  Grief-stricken, he ordered the music room closed, and 
retreated into the sullen, disconsolate world where we find him at the 
film's opening.  </P>
<P>     The central struggle is between Huzar, who represents the "old 
order", and Mahim, who stands for the new.  Huzar is a noble, a product 
of blood and breeding, who is given respect because of who he is and who 
his ancestors were.  His grand palace is like a museum, and he is stuck 
in the past.  He has no money and still uses candles and lanterns.  
Mahim, on the other hand, is a commoner, but, as a result of his 
extremely lucrative profession (moneylending), he has become rich.  He 
aspires to usurp Huzar's position of esteem in the district by building 
his own music room and luring people to his house with the promise of 
electric lights and memorable entertainment.  </P>
<P>     In the APU TRILOGY, Ray drew us into the protagonist's world, 
encouraging us to empathize with Apu through his triumphs and tragedies.  
In JALSAGHAR, the director's approach is different.  He distances the 
audience from the characters, allowing us to observe the culture and 
events from a detached perspective.  As a result, while this movie lacks 
the sublime beauty and simple power of the Apu films, it is no less 
intellectually involving.  That's not to say that JALSAGHAR has no 
emotional impact, but the intent is different.  Although we do not share 
Huzar's despair, we pity him, acknowledging that he has brought this 
ruin upon himself.</P>
<P>     Seen in concert with the APU TRILOGY, JALSAGHAR makes for a 
fascinating study of similarities and contrasts, and helps us see 
another level of Ray's cinematic mastery.  This is a very visual film -- 
there are numerous ingenious shots (including one where a spider crawls 
up the leg of a painted figure) and a stirring dance sequence.  While I 
don't think this movie reaches the pinnacle achieved by APARAJITO and 
APUR SANSAR, it is nevertheless an intriguing and, at times, beguiling 
motion picture that deserves its place among the director's masterworks.</P>
