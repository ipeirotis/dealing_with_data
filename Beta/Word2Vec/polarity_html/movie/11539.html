<P>     A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES is writer/director Boaz Yakin's follow-up to 
his highly-regarded, tautly-paced 1994 picture, FRESH.  Sadly, little of 
the energy and intelligence of the earlier film is evident in this, an 
overwrought melodrama populated by stereotypes and featuring an 
improbable storyline that relies upon a string of coincidences.  
Ostensibly, A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES details the struggle of one woman to 
throw off the shackles of a conservative society, but the manner in 
which Yakin approaches this theme is preachy, pedantic, and predictable.  </P>
<P>     The woman is Sonia (Renee Zellweger) and the society is New York 
City's Hasidic Jewish community.  She is a good woman married to Sender 
(Christopher Eccleston), a highly-respected scholar.  From the 
beginning, Sonia is aware that there is something missing from her 
matrimonial union.  Everything that she finds erotic, he finds indecent.  
To him, sex is exclusively for procreation, not for quenching "the fire" 
that burns inside of his wife.  Any observer can see than Sonia is 
profoundly unhappy, but only her brother-in-law, Mendel (Glenn 
Fitzgerald), offers a solution.</P>
<P>     In addition to giving Sonia work procuring jewelry for his 
underground business, Mendel enters into a sexual relationship with her 
(that, apparently, is the price she pays for getting the job).  As 
unwanted as she finds his rough advances, Sonia is liberated through 
this act of unfaithfulness.  Mendel rationalizes his actions by saying 
that, while everyone sins, "it's the quality of our sins which sets us 
apart."  He obviously considers his violations to be somewhere in the 
upper echelon.  At any rate, as a result of the new facets of life shown 
to her by Mendel, Sonia begins to yearn for the kind of freedom that she 
cannot find within the Hasidic community.  Yet she realizes that if she 
attempts to leave Sender, she will lose everything.  Meanwhile, she 
finds herself battling an attraction to a promising young jewelry maker 
(Allen Payne), which further complicates her situation.  To help her 
with her difficult decisions, Sonia receives advice from two unusual 
agents:  a prophetic bag lady (Kathleen Chalfant) and the ghost of her 
brother (Shelton Dane), who died as a child.</P>
<P>     I needn't say which path Sonia chooses, because, like almost 
everything else in this movie, it's easily guessed.  One of the most 
disappointing aspects of A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES is its lack of originality 
– right down to the too-pat conclusion.  The premise has a great deal of 
potential, little of which is realized.  Instead of fashioning a gallery 
of interesting, multi-dimensional characters around Sonia, Yakin is 
content to plunder a bag of types.  Most of the individuals fall into 
the traditional, morally-upright, inflexible mold of those who stifle 
creativity in the name of conformity.  With the exceptions of Sonia, the 
old Rebbe (John Randolph), and his wife (Kim Hunter), no one within the 
community exhibits even the slightest trace of humanity. </P>
<P>     That's only the tip of the proverbial iceberg, however.  One of the 
most potentially-fascinating elements of A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES is the 
opportunity it affords for an exploration of the Hasidic society.  What 
Yakin gives us, however, is disappointingly superficial, and rivals the 
banality offered by Sidney Lumet in A STRANGER AMONG US, a horribly 
misguided mystery about a murder investigation in the Hasidic community.  
Any film that attempts to delve beneath the surface of a closed society 
will face an inevitable likening to Peter Weir's WITNESS, which painted 
the Amish with a rich, varied brush.  A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES makes the 
not-dissimilar Hasidic people look cartoonish by comparison.</P>
<P>     Yakin's casting choices are also questionable.  While it's easy 
enough to accept Glenn Fitzgerald as a Hasidic bad boy and Julianna 
Margulies as a defender of the community, those two are only supporting 
players; the problems are with the leads.  Christopher Eccleston, who 
was impressive as the title character in 1996's JUDE, is flat and 
unconvincing as Sender.  There's no passion or power in this 
performance; it's a dull, lifeless rendering of a man who is supposed to 
be deeply devout.  I'm not suggesting that Eccleston should have gone 
down the route taken by Robert Duvall in THE APOSTLE, but a little more 
energy might have made Sender seem less like a writer's construct and 
more like an individual.</P>
<P>     The flaw in Renee Zellweger's performance is harder to define.  She 
is a talented actress who has shown range in her past roles (such as 
JERRY MAGUIRE and THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD), but she is miscast as Sonia.  
Despite imbuing her character with spirit and emotion, there's something 
fundamentally "off" in her attempts to portray a Hasidic woman.  
Regardless of how hard she tries, she doesn't fit the part.  There are 
numerous instances when Zellweger's intonations and accent are all 
wrong.  It's the little things that are problematic.</P>
<P>     A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES isn't a complete disaster.  Despite its 
obvious faults, the melodrama is never boring.  My reservations about 
Zellweger's performance don't alter the fact that Sonia is an appealing 
protagonist, and it's not hard to identify with her struggles.  Unlike 
many of the other characters in the film, she is well-developed, 
although certain facets of her personality are built through clichés.  
So, although A PRICE ABOVE RUBIES can be described as "watchable," it 
stands as a mediocre exploration of one woman's attempts to express her 
individuality in a closed society.</P>
