<PRE>                             DUNSTON CHECKS IN
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     DUNSTON CHECKS IN is a kids movie that tells the story of an
animal various called in the movie either an ape or a monkey.  To be
precise an orangutan named Sam plays the part of Dunston.  He is the
best actor in the movie, but he has to suffer with a cliched script
(Bruce Graham and John Hopkins II) and a director (Ken Kwapis) who
seems lost.</P>
<P>     Dunston is an animal owned by an evil cat bugler who claims to be
a Lord Rutledge (Rupert Everett).  He checks into the Majestic Hotel
with the intention of stealing the jewels of the rich guests.
Actually, he just identifies the rooms, and Dunston has to do all of
his dirty work.  Just to show you how evil Rutledge is we are shown a
picture of Dunston's dead brother Samson whom Rutledge has killed for
not doing what he is told him.  This is one of several parts of the
movie that is mean spirited and inappropriate for its intended
audience, but, to be fair, most of the film is harmless.</P>
<P>     In a take off on Leona Helmsley we have the cruel owner Mrs.
Dubrow (Faye Dunaway).  She comes to her hotel and demands that the
first employee she meets be fired to show the employees how tough she
is.  The hotel's manager Robert Grant (Jason Alexander) doesn't
actually fire the employee, but makes Mrs. Dubrow think he did.  She
shares her business philosophy with the audience in such thoughts, "I
like psychotic people.  They get things done."  This continues our
children's education, via kids' movies, in how business owners are all
out to exploit their workers.</P>
<P>     At the beginning of the show, Grant's two sons Kyle (Eric Lloyd)
and Brian (Graham Sack) are up to mischief.  They shoot water that
knocks a fat woman into a fountain where she keeps slipping back in
when she tries to get out.  Most of the jokes in the movie are
slapstick, and few are funny.  I did like some of the wide camera
angles (Peter Lyons Collister) and the art deco sets (Rusty Smith) of
the hotel.  These provide a nice diversion from an otherwise dismal
film.</P>
<P>     Dunston is a lovable and quite serious ape with big eyes.  Seeing
him dressed in one crazy costume (Eugenie Krager) after another plus
his serious and soulful expressions are easily the best parts of the
show.  His miners outfit with his lantern on his head is my favorite.
Sad to say that besides having an owner that threatens to kill him, we
also get to see him smoke and learn that he is trying to give it up.
Why is this in a movie aimed primarily at the 4-10 set?</P>
<P>     Most of the movie has Lord Rutledge chasing Dunston all over the
hotel while the kids hide him and while Mrs. Dubrow gets angry.  Along
the way we get to meet two nice little old ladies only to see them pour
whiskey out of a hidden flask until they get drunk in the middle of the
day in the manager's office.  What is this scene doing in a kid's
movie?  We also get a scene of one boy urinating.  Why?</P>
<P>     The two boy actors in the show are cute but have no script with
which to work.  The others in the movie are all in the barely
acceptable category with the exception of Rupert Everett whose
theoretically funny version of an English aristocrat is so pathetic you
will find yourself looking at your shoes when he is on the screen.  He
asks questions like, "Where do you keep your champagne?  Near the
furnace?", and "From the look of my soup I'd say someone in your
kitchen has a serious hair loss problem."  These are actually some of
the better pieces of drivel the actors have to utter.</P>
<P>     In the sight gags, we have poor Dunston, who is naturally
compelling, being forced to do such silliness as drink perfume, put
women's underwear on his head, and drink water that is holding false
teeth.  None of these setups are original or funny.  In perhaps the
most out of place scene in the show, Dunston gives an erotic message to
a woman wrapped only in a towel.  She thinks he is someone else and
gets turned on by it.  Remember again, the age audience that is going
to see this film.</P>
<P>     Finally, we have Pee Wee Herman listed as Paul Reubens playing La
Farge.  He is an animal control expert who wears lavender suits and has
big shifty eyes.  A strange performance to say the least.</P>
<P>     DUNSTON CHECKS IN, wish I hadn't, runs 1:30.  Thanks to meandering
editing by Jon Poll, it feels much longer.  It is rated PG, but it
should be PG-13 for all of the above mentioned inappropriate scenes.
Most of these should have been cut out anyway in a movie certain to be
seen mainly by kids 4-10 no matter what the rating.  I do not recommend
this show to anyone.  To be fair, I should point out that my son
Jeffrey (age 6 3/4) liked it and gives it his usual thumbs up.  At
least there was nothing in it to scare him.  I give the movie * solely
for Dunston's potential and his great serious look.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
