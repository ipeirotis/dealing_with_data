<P>     There's an old adage that states:  "Just because something can be 
done doesn't mean it should be done."  Director Steve Barron (THE 
CONEHEADS) might have been advised to pay attention to this saying.  
There's no reason why movie audiences need a live action retelling of 
the story immortalized in 1940 by the animators at Disney.  Not only is 
the original PINOCCHIO (based on the satirical work by C. Collodi) a 
motion picture classic, but it makes this dull, feeble re-telling look 
like the product of second-rate hacks. </P>
<P>     As in the Disney version, we're introduced to the kindly 
puppetmaker, Gepetto (Martin Landau), who lives alone with his 
creations.  One day, he carves a little boy out of a magical log, and 
Pinocchio (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas) comes to life -- literally.  
At first, Gepetto is understandably surprised by this turn of events, 
but his shock turns to delight when the wooden boy calls him "papa".  
Like all children, Pinocchio is imbued with curiosity, and it soon gets 
him into trouble.  Before long, he is being pursued by the two evil 
lackeys (Bebe Neuwirth and Rob Schneider) of a nasty puppeteer (Udo 
Kier).  This leads to scenes on an island where bad boys become donkeys, 
and in the belly of a whale. </P>
<P>     When I was young, PINOCCHIO was my favorite Disney animated film.  
It was, I thought, a perfect blend of adventure, fantasy, and 
excitement.  Even now, amidst quantum advances in animation, the scenes 
with the whale never fail to impress.  And then there's Jimney Cricket, 
one of Disney's best-ever sidekicks.  His rendition of "When You Wish 
Upon a Star" (obviously absent from this new version) is a highlight.  
PINOCCHIO is no less magical today than it was in 1940.  And magic is 
precisely the quality missing from New Line Cinema's THE ADVENTURES OF 
PINOCCHIO. </P>
<P>     When everything is animated, it's easy to accept all that 
transpires during this tale.  However, put live actors on screen with an 
animatronic puppet, and, suddenly, there's an issue of credibility.  No 
matter how cute and imaginative this Pinocchio is, it never seems real.  
It's a walking visual effect, and the slight imperfections visible in 
the manner by which it is brought to life are painfully apparent.  In 
large part because of this, it's difficult to be drawn into the film's 
reality. </P>
<P>     The only actor who isn't completely wasted is Martin Landau, whose 
performance as Gepetto is one of the film's few high points.  Jonathan 
Taylor Thomas is Pinocchio, but, mercifully, the young star's on-screen 
time is limited to a few scenes near the end.  Genevieve Bujold is 
completely wasted as Leona, Gepetto's long-time love.  In place of the 
unforgettable Jimney Cricket, this version gives us Pepe the 
grasshopper, a philosophizing insect whose voice is provided by David 
Doyle. </P>
<P>     THE ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO offers parents an obvious source of 
midsummer entertainment for their offspring.  Alas, this is a pale 
imitation of what has come before, and yet another example of 
Hollywood's unwillingness to strike out in new directions.  This 
PINOCCHIO is representative of the mentality that has studios finding a 
comfortable, well-worn niche and hunkering down in its relative safety.  
So, although this particular stringless puppet might be transformed into 
a real live boy, he's stuck in a movie that's more pointless than 
lively. </P>
