<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A totally unbelievable coming of age love story told from the female's
perspective. It takes place in San Francisco and is about a bohemian
photographer in his fifties, Connie (Rea), who exploits younger women
who live with him while he teaches them to be artists. Connie meets the
shy girl, who'll be 21 in a few months, Harper Sloane (Polley), at her
sister's wedding, where he is the wedding photographer. She feels
awkward being there and the photographer does his best to make her feel
at ease. She tells him that she does not want her photo taken, which
becomes his way of gaining her confidence, by not including her picture
in the wedding party.</P>
<P>Connie has taken one alluring photo of her at the wedding, which she
picks up at his studio apartment, and he signs it to my Guinevere. He
sweet talks her, calling her Guinevere (for some inexplicable reason he
calls all his lovers that), and finds that she is vulnerable and dying
for romantic attention. She is very unhappy in her affluent but chilly
household of lawyers, where she is expected to follow suit and go to
Harvard law school, a school she has been accepted to but tells her
parents that she was rejected from. Dad is a lawyer, her older sister
and her sister's husband are lawyers.</P>
<P>It's unbelievable that her parents will not catch this lie about her
rejection from law school and it is even more unbelievable of her moving
in with the photographer but telling them she is living with her
girlfriend Patty without her parents checking this out.</P>
<P>Her brief romance with Connie, for less than a year, helps her overcome
her inadequacies, and gives her a chance to sexually develop. Connie has
a history of being with young girls he trained by his live-in
arrangement method. She meets his other girls, sees that they all have
photos taken of their breasts also, and she becomes friendly with them,
sharing their stories and experience. Everything about these
girl-to-girl conversations seemed forced. Gina Gershon, in a very slight
part, is the one who distinguishes herself most of all the girls, by
being her closest confidante.</P>
<P>The most praiseworthy scene takes place some sixty minutes into the
film, when Mrs.
Deborah Sloane (Jean Smart) appears in the lovebird's nest. Mrs. Sloane
is an elegant, articulate woman, in her forties, who is not afraid to
tell Connie what she thinks of him. She does not make a loud scene, but
rather lawyer-like presents her case against him. She tells
Connie:"You're even older than me, and you're f*cking my daughter." She
also adds, that no woman who is not physically perfect would dare show
her flesh to the experienced eyes of Connie. And she then comes to her
main point, "I know exactly what my daughter has that I haven't got. It
is Awe." Connie- whose reaction is of visible hurt, replies "You're
quite a woman, Deborah." But she puts him down with "Mrs. Sloane. I am
Mrs. Sloane," and she departs. This simple truth hurts the
photographer's pride significantly. And that's the gist of the movie.
Though it does drag on for an excrutiatingly embarrassing forty more
minutes, until it predictably shows Harper overcoming her problems of
feeling inadequate.</P>
<P>The film heads down a road of corn ball contrivances, that kill any
chance for this story to be taken seriously. Connie has to be
hospitalized for detoxification, and he is also broke. Therefore, the
couple drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles where he hopes to sell
some of his pictures. Sadly, he is reduced to getting a handout from an
old friend. Then in a restaurant he loses some false teeth while eating
and to pay the dentist they pawn his Nikon camera. While staying in a
motel room, he sends out Harper to buy liquor and leaves her there with
enough money to get back to San Francisco, too humiliated to face her
again. Four years later, Harper is now a successful photographer and
returns to see the dying Connie, whom she always had a kind opinion of,
joining the four other Guineveres who are heaping praise on their soon
to be departed lover and guru, in a fantasy scene that is sickeningly
pointless.</P>
<P>It was very difficult to watch these talented performers saying all this
soap opera mush, which trivialized what could have been an interesting
film about a woman learning to become a woman through sex, if in the
hands of a more capable director/screenwriter. Polley is a fine actress
and her performance when first encountering sex, is one of nervous
apprehension and childish giggles. It was the only thing about this film
that felt real, of a young girl coming to terms with her sexuality and
waking up to all the possibilities that she was a woman. But that brief
scene, as powerful as it was, was not enough to save this mawkish film
for first-time director Audrey Wells.</P>
