<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Dariush Mehrjui is one of Iran's finest modern filmmakers, his
speciality is making films about relationships among the
upper-middle-class illuminati, and especially love stories about women.
This drama is a very powerful, poignant and mesmerizing love story,
about the pressures of dealing with Moslem traditions and of a woman's
own sense of being.</P>
<P>A very warm couple, the handsome Reza (Ali Mosaffa) and the beautiful
Leila (Leila Hatami), perfectly suited for each other in temperament
find happiness in their first year of marriage. Why this marriage should
turn ice cold, when everything is so blissful, is amazing to watch as it
unfolds. This is a truly heartbreaking tale without contrivances, that
examines a woman's psyche, looking carefully at her wants and her
expectations. The trouble starts when after a year, there is no child.
The couple go to a doctor and are tested to see if either one has
infertility problems. They swear their love for each other, and in their
own quiet way, say that it doesn't matter who is to blame, they will
stay married no matter what. The problem comes from Leila's overbearing
mother-in-law (Jamileh Sheikhi), a monster, if there ever was one. She
rattles the poor, sensitive girl and completely intimidates her,
stressing how important it is to have a son to carry out the family
name. The wealthy Reza, who works in his father's company, is the only
son, there are four daughters. When the news from the lab comes back
that Leila is barren, that her hormonal levels are too low to ever have
children, the mother-in-law heartlessly puts the burden on her,
naggingly telling her that she is holding her son back from raising a
family, as he confided to others that he really wants one.</P>
<P>The weak son never confronts his mother, as he seems perplexed, even as
his wife begins to slowly sink into a shell, confused and ashamed about
herself, unwilling to confide in anyone, not even her mother. She
receives passive support from Reza, but she can't face the treacherous
mother-in-law when alone, who has the gift of twisting things around
during her visits while pretending to be nice by bearing gifts and then
she turns on the acid tongue, making Leila feel inadequate, as she just
tries to please her by agreeing with whatever she says. The mother is so
invasive of the couple's privacy, that she calls them always at the
wrong moment and the ringing phone is like a knife sticking in Leila, it
is so painful to just watch the phone and hear it ringing, and watch
Leila cringe at the thought of hearing what her mother-in-law has to
say.</P>
<P>The selfish mother-in-law after two years of intimidating the girl,
telling her Reza wants a child so much he will sneak behind her back and
have a child with another woman, and then have the nerve to suggest that
Leila give her permission for Reza to get another wife, as evidently,
polygamy is permitted in Iran.</P>
<P>Reza reacts by saying he doesn't want another wife, and that he can live
happily without children, just as long as she returns to being the old
playful Leila, who smiles so easily and is close to him. But he never
reassures her that he means what he says, and she grows more distant
from him, talking to herself aloud, so that we could hear her hurtful
thoughts, things that she feels she can't tell anyone else. She can't
take the pressure anymore, so she pushes Reza to look for a new wife. On
each occasion, when Reza goes courting, he requests that she ride with
him to meet his perspective bride, as he drops her off by the  stores to
shop while he goes to look over the woman his Aunt Shamsi or his
mother-in-law chose for him.</P>
<P>Reza is never forceful enough in his statements telling her that it
doesn't matter that she can't have children, as Leila has nagging doubts
about whether he really means it or is just saying it. The couple have
all the creature comforts of modern life and act like modern people do,
and are seen playfully watching Dr. Zhivago on TV together, but
tradition is also very strong. She stays home and does the cooking and
the womanly chores, while wearing, as she must, by Iranian law, a chador
to cover her head. There seems to be no problem following these
traditions, but this modern couple has its feet stuck in two different
worlds and they seem confused as to where they really want to be
standing.</P>
<P>I recently saw another film from the Middle-East, "Kadosh," an Israeli
film with the same topic and the same intransigent attitude was
displayed by those who call themselves orthodox believers in God, who
believe a woman who is barren has been cursed by God, they were Hasidim,
a sect of the Jewish religion.</P>
<P>It is curious that the men are so docile, that Reza never tells his
mother to mind her own business, and even though Reza's father disagrees
with what his wife is doing, he never stops her from ruining his son's
marriage. And when he takes a second wife, Leila has had enough. She
can't live with him anymore in the same house, though she bears no
grudge against his new wife, she still returns to her mother's house and
withdraws from Reza completely, quietly disrespecting him and filling
herself with self-pity. She says that she has turned to stone. When she
learns that the new wife gives birth to a baby girl, she anxiously takes
a peek at the girl, but has no love anymore for Reza and as she once
refused to answer him when he told her after the wedding that he would
divorce his new wife if she would return, she still refuses his offers.
It is too late for him to regain her love and his dignity as a man. When
the new wife divorces him because he can't love her and gets a generous
alimony and then weds her old suitor, because she now has the kind of
money she never had before, she ironically leaves the baby girl to be
raised by Reza's mother. The perfect marriage is destroyed forever as 10
years have passed since we first saw the happy couple meeting at a
family communal where they made a traditional pudding, and all Reza
could now do is be angry with his mother for ruining his life, still
unaware of how weakly he behaved.</P>
<P>This is a very compelling and subtle film, on one hand it shows the
current conflict in Iran between modernity and Islamic tradition, but on
the other hand, this is a penetrating film about the universal problem
of love, as seen through the psyche of a woman who is stripped of her
self-esteem, and even though she is beautiful and has a considerate
husband, she is still not sure of what her role is in society. This is a
very sensitive tale; it is film that was convincing in every possible
situation it presented; it is the work of a great director.</P>
