<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This provocative black comedy/fantasy regarding doomsday and Cold War
politics, features a planned nuclear attack by a psychotic commander of
a nuclear base, General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling), who blames the
Commies for messing up the water with fluoride and trying to ruin our
body fluids.The film takes place in the 60s, after the showdown with the
Russians over the "Bay of Pigs failure." President Johnson, as the new
leader, is not in a position to take any threat from the Russians
lightly. The country itself was a bit paranoid during this tense period
of the Cold War. As technology used in the wrong way was no laughing
matter, a nuclear war was a strong possibility. That this film is able
to exploit that craziness of attitudes prevailing and make a stinging
satirical comedy out of it, a film that is not passé, even as of today,
in 1999, after 35 years, speaks volumes for its satirical power.</P>
<P>Dr. Strangelove is noted for Peter Sellers' masterful performances in
three distinct roles: Dr. Strangelove (an eccentric scientist), Mr.
Merkin Muffley (President of the US), and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake
(a stereotype of a British officer with a stiff upper lip).</P>
<P>The film ominously opens as the narrator in a voice-over tells about a
top-secret Doomsday Machine which could reduce the world to nothingness,
as we look over a trail of dense cloud cover and Rocky mountain peaks in
the distance, with the Earth uninhabitated by humans.</P>
<P>The nature of the film is irreverence for those who are involved in
building up this nuclear conflict. Kubrick is cleverly able to connect
the sexual obsessions the male caricutures have with the Cold War, which
is clearly indicated by the names he gave them: Jack D. Ripper (a
notorious English sexual serial killer), Mandrake (a plant root said to
encourage fertility), George C. Scott as Buck Turgidson (a male stud),
Merkin (slang for female pubic area), Muffley (a pubic hair wig), Keenan
Wynn as Colonel Guano (meaning bat excrement), the name used for the
unseen Russian President, Kissof ( literally- 'start of disaster'),
Peter Bull as the Russian Ambassador de Sadeski (named after the Marquis
de Sade), and Slim Pickens, the nuclear flight commander, "King" Kong
(signifying a beast with a destructive lust).</P>
<P>The film cuts back and forth from three main set locations (the office
of the bomb group commander of Air Force command base, the
claustrophobic flight deck interior of the B-52 bomber, and the
Pentagon's War Room). Each area is a rich source for uncontrollable
mirth and confusion, as the actors play their roles with mock
seriousness, seemingly trapped by their physical surroundings and by
their cartoon-like roles they are playing.</P>
<P>Group Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers) receives a phone call from his
supervisor, Strategic Air Command General Jack D. Ripper, who sits at
his desk in a dark room, chomping on a large cigar.The obsessively
paranoid, crazed, right-wing commander informs Mandrake of  a
"shooting war": As the base is sealed according to Condition Red and all
radios are impounded because they can be used to issue instructions to
saboteurs. Ripper is beyond being dissuaded from going over-the-top, as
he does not respond to Mandrake's attempts at stopping him from
following through on the nuclear attack.</P>
<P>In the B-52 bomber, the crew is busy doing their routines, with Major
Kong gaping at the centerfold of Playboy Magazine, when his radio man
tells him about the Red Alert. At first, he thinks the men are horsing
around, but when convinced this is for real, we see the Texan don his
ten gallon cowboy hat and open up the instruction manual for such an
emergency and literally take us through the necessary steps to get their
mission on the way, while the music in the background strikes up, 'When
Johnny Comes Marching Home.' Over the intercom, he delivers in his heavy
Texas drawl a patriotic speech to his men - a parody of what a real
American might be thinking.</P>
<P>The Pentagon's huge underground War Room, a cavernous site with a round
conference table, is the third central focus of the film. Lights
illuminate the room from
above in a circle, casting a glow over the 'Adlai Stevenson-like'
President, Merkin Muffley and his advisors who sit at the round table.
At the far end of the room is the Big Board - a massive graphic display
strategic map lit to indicate the progress of the bomber wing planes to
their Russian targets.</P>
<P>The President is briefed by his hawkish Air Force General Buck Turgidson
of the orders issued by General Jack Ripper to the 34 B-52's engaged in
an airborne exercise dubbed "Operation Dropkick." The planes are now
fully armed with nuclear weapons and are on their way to hit their
designated targets in Russia.</P>
<P>Kubrick leaves us with a score of memorable scenes: when the President
talks to his Russian counterpart and they each try to decide who is
sorrier about what is happening, to Major Kong descending atop the bomb
when the bomb-release mechanism fails to function, and to Colonel Guano
shooting the sacred private property Coca-Cola machine to get change for
Mandrake, who is trying to save the world by getting some small change
to call the White House on a public pay phone. But none is more
memorable than seeing President Muffley consult with a wheelchair-bound
German nuclear scientist (an ex-Nazi who changed his name from
Merkwuerdigich-liebe, literally meaning "strange-love," when he became a
citizen). Wearing thick dark sunglasses, Dr. Strangelove, director of
weapons research and development, also has a black-gloved mechanical,
robotic hand which shakily holds his cigarette, as he whines with a
German accent: After making calculations with a slide ruler with his
black-gloved robotic hand, which he can't stop from raising in salute to
his Fuehrer, he tells the President that certain select elite people
could survive a nuclear attack for a 100 years by living underground.
Strangelove's future vision of "strange love" is a love-less, impersonal
sexual one, in a world in which everyone can "Stop Worrying and Love the
Bomb." A theme of inhumanity Kubrick kept intact throughout his film
career, even in his last film, Eyes Wide Shut...This is one of the
greatest political satires, if not the greatest ever made. A not to be
missed film.</P>
