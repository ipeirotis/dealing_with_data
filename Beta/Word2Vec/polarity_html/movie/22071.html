<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Takeshi "Beat" Kitano is certainly a unique director, whose absurdist
style of filmmaking is readily recognizable, achieving auteur status. He
has a fascination with gangsters, violence, and in presenting his quirky
black humor in a most compelling way. His films are always visually
startling, with a bevy of bizarre shots, and, so far, all his films have
gotten away with a mindless but intriguing storyline. In this, his
second feature, he doesn't live up to the high standards of his other
films shown in America (Violent Cop/Sonatine/Fireworks), but this is
only because he has a small part in this film, as Uehara, a mesmerizing
psychotic yakuza killer, who is even too crazy and violent for the
organized crime gang he once was a part of. He is so fascinating to
watch, that it is shame we couldn't see more of his lunacy; instead, the
supporting cast, funny as they are with their deadpan humor,
nevertheless, they cannot carry the film, and Kitano has chosen to
center the film around them. Fortunately, there are plenty of his usual
visual treats in this film, that make the film seem special anyhow.</P>
<P>Kitano, also, relishes giving women roles that could be considered
demeaning. Though it is sickeningly amusing to see how rough-shod he
treats them in so callous and an ungentlemanly manner, that one might be
caught ruefully laughing at them getting dumped on and treated as
garbage, and supposedly liking it and coming back for more, it still
shows that he doesn't really know how to portray women on screen. Who
knows! Maybe he knows something I don't know. But there is never any
romance in his films that amount to anything, and this film is no
exception.</P>
<P>Boiling Point begins and ends on a sandlot baseball field, where only
the amateur players attend, except for the coach's girlfriend and later
on for the sweet girlfriend, Sayaka (Yuriko Ishida), of the deadpan star
of the film, Masaka (Ono). He picks her up in a restaurant because
that's what his friend tells him to do. Masaka is a loser, who has no
problem being who he is. He is inarticulate, moronic, and the worst one
on a losing baseball team, who doesn't even get into the game except as
a pinch-hitter, someone who will strike out without swinging at a ball.
He is also inept in the gas station where he works, and when he fails to
properly service a local yakuza's car, he gets punched out and
threatened. But when he punches back, the yakuza claims his arm is
broken and he wants compensation. This mindless act escalates on both
sides, and, of course, it makes no sense. But it is made a big deal when
the local yakuza head, Otomo (Igawa), comes to see the gas station owner
and demands revenge.</P>
<P>When the baseball coach (Takahito Iguchi), an ex-yakuza himself, tries
to come to the rescue of Masaka and is disrespected by the gang, who
pummel him. He is now drawn heavily into the conflict and wants to go to
Okinawa to see the vicious ex-yakuza, Uehara, who will get him a gun.
Since he is too beaten up to get out of bed, Masaka, bent on getting
back at the gangsters, volunteers to go there with one of his baseball
friends.</P>
<P>He meets the maniacal Uehara in a disco bar, and in the gangster's
presence a series of violent acts take place, which include male rape,
the baseball players being constantly intimidated and abused, the
mobster's girl getting slapped around for sleeping with someone Uehara
ordered her to sleep with, the whimsical tossing out of the car of
another mobster's girl, the cutting off of Uehara's associate's finger
by him to give to the yakuza organization as repayment for his
embezzlement of them, and the killing of the messenger bringing him the
guns he requested. This is all casually done, as if this kind of mayhem
was as natural as eating rice cakes.</P>
<P>By some strange luck, the two baseball players return alive with their
needed gun to seek revenge. Meantime, Uehara walks into the yakuza
chief's headquarters armed with his associate's finger and a AK-47
hidden in a bouquet of wildflowers, as he settles up with the yakuza who
want his finger and their money back that he embezzled.</P>
<P>Masaka is unable to go through with killing the local yakuza chief with
the gun he brought back, but a gas truck barrels into their headquarters
killing all of the gangsters that are present.</P>
<P>If there is any point to this story, and I am not sure there is, but the
message here might be, that friends are needed to help you out, no one
is immune from the insanity that is in the air, because according to
Kitano, insanity is catching. And, if taking a stand alone against many,
you are in deep trouble. Even in a structured country like Japan,
enamored by a structured game like baseball, it must point to the belief
that the madness of the world cannot be kept out for those who think by
them playing by the rules they can make the world orderly.</P>
<P>Somehow this visual feast of a film was strangely appealing and original
in all aspects of filmmaking. So let me say bravo to the one time
stand-up comedian who doesn't know how to make a safe film, and tip my
Eagle baseball hat to him, not only for hitting a home run, but showing
that one can hit a home run but not score the needed winning run by
running past the man who was on base. This is Buster Keaton burlesque
with Martin Scorsese and Dirty Harry flavor thrown in for bad luck... A
cult film delight as a cruel form of entertainment, that is not for all
tastes, naturally.</P>
<P>Incidently, the American title to the film, Boiling Point, is
misleading: in Japanese the title refers in slang to a baseball score.</P>
