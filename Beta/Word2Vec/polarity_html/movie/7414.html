<P>     If I had a choice between attending Romy and Michele's high school 
reunion or the one with John Cusack at Grosse Pointe, which would I 
choose?  It's actually a difficult decision, because, although the two 
movies have vastly different strengths and weaknesses, the bottom line 
is that they're of similar quality.  GROSSE POINTE BLANK is, at times, 
too dark and disjointed.  ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION is, on 
the other hand, occasionally a little too light and vacuous.  And, if 
GROSSE POINTE has too much of an edge, then ROMY AND MICHELE doesn't 
have enough of one.  All things considered, however, I think I'll take 
the girls over the hit man.  </P>
<P>     That said, those expecting a female version of DUMB AND DUMBER are 
in for a disappointment.  Yes, Romy (Mira Sorvino) and Michele (Lisa 
Kudrow) have vacuum-filled brain cavities, and the film doesn't shy away 
from raunchy sexual innuendo, but the pervasive flatulence of the Jim 
Carrey/Jeff Daniels comedy is entirely absent.  ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH 
SCHOOL REUNION is about two ditzes who adore PRETTY WOMAN, think Mono is 
"the best diet ever", and believe that looking fantastic is the most 
important thing.  </P>
<P>     The title characters are blond Southern California babes who have 
been rooming together since they moved to the L.A. area after graduating 
from high school.  They have been friends for a lot longer -- two 
inseparable peas in a pod who have never fit in with the hip crowd and 
have never cared that they're outsiders.  Now, a decade after brushing 
the dust of Tucson, Arizona from their heels, the receive word that the 
Sagebrush High School Class of '87 is holding a ten-year reunion.  So, 
armed with lies about how they have become successful business women, 
they head east to impress the classmates who used to taunt and ridicule 
them.</P>
<P>     Neither Mira Sorvino (MIGHTY APHRODITE, for which she won a Best 
Supporting Actress Oscar) nor Lisa Kudrow (MOTHER, TV's FRIENDS) is a 
stranger to playing this sort of dumb-as-a-post role.  Under the control 
of two such deft comic talents, Romy and Michele are exaggerated just 
enough to be funny but not so much that they're unsympathetic.  The 
characters originally appeared in screenwriter Robin Schiff's stage 
play, THE LADIES' ROOM, and were inspired by a pair of real individuals 
whom Schiff overheard talking in a night club bathroom.  In fact, the 
most disturbing thing about ROMY AND MICHELE is recognizing that there 
are actually people in this world who think and act like these two 
cartoon characters do.</P>
<P>     Although I smiled frequently during the film, I didn't laugh too 
often.  Perhaps surprisingly, a lot of the humor is low-key, and there 
are very few truly hilarious moments.  Another problem is that the 
script unsuccessfully attempts to inject a little lame drama with a 
moral ("be true to yourself") into the mix.  I have no problem with 
ambitious comedies introducing dramatic elements into the storyline, but 
those aspects should be less banal than the ones pulled off the "stock 
plot device" shelf for this movie.  ROMY AND MICHELE is at its best when 
it's being lighthearted and at its weakest when it takes a halfhearted 
stab at semi-seriousness.</P>
<P>     As in GROSSE POINTE BLANK, the reunion is something of a 
disappointment (actually, for reasons I won't go into here, there are 
two reunions).  ROMY AND MICHELE starts out exceptionally strong, with 
lots of flashbacks and reminiscences about the girls' high school days, 
but it loses momentum by the time the duo reaches Tucson.  The final 
forty-five minutes features a few clever moments (including a bizarre 
dance number with Sorvino, Kudrow, and Alan Cumming), but almost all of 
the best scenes occur during the first half.  </P>
<P>     ROMY AND MICHELE boasts a lively supporting cast.  As is often the 
case, Janeane Garofalo (THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS) steals her share 
of scenes.  Playing a chain-smoking, foul-mouthed business woman, she 
pops in and out of the film to make life generally miserable for 
everyone around her.  Alan Cumming (EMMA) is the nerd who once had a 
crush on Michele, and Vincent Ventresca (TV's BOSTON COMMON) is the stud 
who caught Romy's eye.  Julia Campbell (TV's MEN BEHAVING BADLY) is that 
staple of the reunion movie -- the stuck-up prom queen whose vocabulary 
is made up solely of put-downs.</P>
<P>     ROMY AND MICHELE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION is one of those pleasant 
movie-going experiences that doesn't offend, excite, or challenge 
anyone.  There are all sorts of likable things about it -- Sorvino and 
Kudrow, accessible humor, and an '80s soundtrack that's the most 
definitive survey of the decade in pop music since PETER'S FRIENDS.  
First-time director David Mirkin brings a lot of energy to the 
production, always keeping things moving.  And, perhaps most 
intriguingly, anyone who has ever gone to a reunion will recognize a 
kernel of truth lurking under all of ROMY AND MICHELE'S blond and 
brainless icing. </P>
