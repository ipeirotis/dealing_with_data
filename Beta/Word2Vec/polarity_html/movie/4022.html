<P>     Coming-of-age movies generally fall into one of two categories:  
fresh, honest stories that transcend formulas or "safe" tales that 
embrace them.  Despite fitting perfectly into the latter camp, ANGUS 
nevertheless works--at least to some degree.  It is neither surprising 
nor original, but moments of genuine joy and poignancy, coupled with 
some solidly-developed characters, make ANGUS a better film than the 
storyline suggests.  Unfortunately, a poor conclusion blunts many of the 
picture's better elements. </P>
<P>     An intelligent high school freshman with an aptitude for chemistry 
and some ability on a football offensive line, Angus Bethune (Charlie 
Talbert) is far from the golden boy of the class.  That's because, 
regardless of his good-natured and self-deprecating personality, all his 
fellow schoolmates see is an overweight teen who sweats a lot and cares 
little for his appearance.  It's a story that's played out everywhere in 
this world, both for children and adults--those who don't conform are 
ostracized, and the resulting pain can be a difficult burden to bear. </P>
<P>     Angus has only one real friend, Troy (Chris Owen), who is as much a 
misfit as his larger companion.  However, while Angus is fat, Troy is 
short and skinny, with a face that resembles Howdy Doody's.  At home, 
Angus' "support system" includes a loving truck driver mother (Kathy 
Bates) and a liberal-minded, free-speaking grandfather (George C. Scott) 
who's engaged to a woman forty years his junior.   </P>
<P>     Angus' nemesis is quarterback and class president Rick Sanford 
(James Van Der Beek), a nasty-minded individual who will go to any 
lengths to embarrass and degrade the science whiz.  To that end, Rick 
arranges for Angus to be voted king of the freshman Winter Ball.  The 
queen, who the king is supposed to dance with, is Rick's beautiful, 
ultra-popular girlfriend, Melissa Lefevre (Ariana Richards, of JURASSIC 
PARK), upon whom Angus has secretly had a crush for years. </P>
<P>     ANGUS is never subtle, but for the first seventy-five minutes, it 
gets the point across with style, humor, and an occasional bittersweet 
moment.  The predictability isn't much of a drawback since the 
characters--particularly Talbert's title personae--are essayed with 
great sympathy.  At some point in life, every teenager has to come to 
grips with who he or she is and what they wish they could be.  Angus' 
dilemma is that he wants to be normal, but can't.  He's socially inept, 
has two left feet, and is too nervous to talk to girls.  He's even 
frightened to take his grandfather's advice to "Screw [everyone]!  Who 
cares what anybody thinks?"  As portrayed through most of this film, 
Angus is a believably insecure young man who is routinely picked on 
while trying to find the courage to persevere. </P>
<P>     George C. Scott hasn't had a memorable role since he donned 
Patton's four-star helmet and ivory-handled revolver in 1970.  And, 
while ANGUS certainly isn't classic Scott, the veteran's repartee with 
newcomer Talbert is as well delivered as it is intelligently written.  
Kathy Bates is woefully underused in a role that gives her almost no 
screen time.  The kids all do solid jobs, except James Van Der Beek, who 
is too sneeringly nasty. </P>
<P>     All of us have been the butt of a joke at one point or another, so 
it's not hard to empathize with Angus' situation.  Director Patrick Read 
Johnson and his young actor effectively convey the awkward moments of 
being an out-of-place adolescent.  For that reason, adults may find 
enough in this movie to keep them as involved as the younger generation 
(the movie seems aimed at the eleven-to-fourteen year old group).  
Unfortunately, ANGUS is determined to have a grand, over-the-top ending 
that makes the finale of SCENT OF A WOMAN look restrained.  How's that 
for cornball?? </P>
<P>     So, in going for mass crowd appeal, Johnson damages his film.  The 
watershed moment is too obvious, and no stone is left unturned in the 
attempt to get the audience up and clapping.  However, as is often the 
case when a movie tries this hard, it destroys the illusion of the story 
and we become uncomfortably aware that we're watching something scripted 
and acted.  On the whole, ANGUS has its own kind of low-key magic, but 
the enchantment is rudely dispelled by the ill-advised final act. </P>
