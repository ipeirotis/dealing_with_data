<PRE>THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Martha (Monica Potter from PATCH ADAMS), who hails from the home of the
Mall of America, is off on a one-way ticket to London because the price
was right.  With less than $200 to her name, the penniless Martha
snagged a bargain ticket.  She's left behind her drug-dealer infested
tenement building, and she's off now to live in London on the $32 she
has left in her purse.</P>
<P>In a movie that never rings true, Martha is the most unbelievable
character of the lot.  Although writer Peter Morgan would have us
believe that this woman, who has been turned down for a dozen jobs in
the past year, is destitute, she appears nothing of the sort.  With
fashion model looks, make-up, clothing and jewelry, Martha doesn't
appear to have ever come any closer to poverty than an overcharged
American Express Platinum card.</P>
<P>A supposedly unsuccessful woman, she has an unrealistically simplistic
outlook.  "All of my life I was told that if I worked hard and stayed
out of trouble, my life would be a fairy tale."  She's depressed because
she's never met her Prince Charming.</P>
<P>In a story of overlapping chance encounters, Martha ends up being the
would-be girlfriend of three English buddies.</P>
<P>The first of these we meet is Laurence (Joseph Fiennes from SHAKESPEARE
IN LOVE), a champion bridge player, who makes his living teaching the
game to flocks of middle-age women.  The slow paced movie has him
telling the story in flashback to his psychiatrist neighbor, Dr. Pederer
(Ray Winstone).  Fiennes isn't given much to do other than mope around
with a single sad sack expression.  Still, his dour look is so
exceedingly handsome it almost makes up for his character's lack of
energy.</P>
<P>The first of these childhood buddies to fall under Martha's spell is
Daniel (Tom Hollander).  A fabulously wealthy record producer, he's used
to hitting on every pretty woman who comes within flirting distance.  A
proudly shallow bloke, he had his library filled with second-hand books
by his interior decorator in order to create the illusion of an enhanced
intellectual capacity.</P>
<P>The other friend in this male trio is Frank (Rufus Sewell), a cynic who
wears his obnoxiousness on his rumpled sleeve.  He likes nothing better
than showing off his crude behavior by obscene verbal jousting with his
buddies.  Like Laurence, Frank, with his 2-day beard and disheveled
clothing, always looks like he just woke from a long drinking binge.</P>
<P>In The World According to Frank, art galleries exist solely for men to
find women to lay.  His ideal partner, the egotistical Franks boasts, is
himself.  Or more precisely, himself "with breasts."</P>
<P>As ploddingly directed by Nick Hamm, the movie is a romance without much
genuine chemistry and a comedy without any laughs.  Best viewed as a
small, melancholic drama, the by-the-numbers story takes few chances.
Why couldn't the writer introduce some ambiguity and real mystery into
the tale and not make the outcome so obvious?</P>
<P>The movie's saving grace, to the extent it has any, is a nice but
completely predictable conclusion.  The ending's few fun twists add a
little spice to an otherwise bland film.</P>
<P>THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU runs 1:28.  It is rated R for profanity and
would be acceptable for teenagers.  [We saw the film abroad without
the aid of an MPAA rating and suspected, incorrectly, that it was a
PG-13 film.]</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, didn't think much of the movie, giving it just *
1/2.  He didn't like Frank's language and found the story confusing at
times.  He was, however, enthralled with Monica Potter, saying "man, she
was gorgeous."</P>
<P>The film, which is playing now in Australia, will open later this summer
in the United States.  It was released last year in Britain with the
title of MARTHA, MEET FRANK, DANIEL AND LAURENCE.</P>
