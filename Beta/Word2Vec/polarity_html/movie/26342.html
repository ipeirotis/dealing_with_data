<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Vincente Minnelli makes another attempt to get at the Hollywood psyche
ten years after his successful venture with the same theme in"The Bad
and the Beautiful." Jack Andrus (Kirk Douglas) is in a private asylum
for the last few years in Connecticut after being a big-name movie star
and then suffering a nervous breakdown. He hit the bottle, divorced his
licentious wife Carlotta (Cyd Charisse), and had a messy car accident.
For the last six years he has become a forgotten actor, as he tries to
understand what happened to him.</P>
<P>A telegram comes from the director who gave him his big break and with
whom he made his best films, Maurice Kruger (Edward G. Robinson),
someone he has had a love-hate relationship with. He offers Jack a
chance to get back into the picture business with a small part in the
film he is finishing up in two weeks in Rome's Cinecitta. With the
doctor's blessing at the asylum, he takes the job and the big wages
offered.</P>
<P>In Rome, he continues his contentious relationship with Kruger and his
wife Clara (Trevor), who has a poisonous tongue aimed toward Jack.
Kruger has problems with his Italian producer (Doro) about the contract
and underneath the guise of success, he is on the ropes, as this is his
last chance to make a Hollywood film. He had to wait two years just to
get a chance to make this film. The has-been director and washed-up
actor share a common fate. To make matters worse for Kruger, he must get
the film done in two weeks, there will be no time extention. Since
Kruger wants to make a quality film in order to show Hollywood he can
still make great films, he is stuck with a major problem, as he dubs his
films into English at the end of the production and because of the time
restraints, if he doesn't finish on schedule the producer will do the
editing for him. He, thereby, uses his guile to get Jack to dub the film
while it is being finished.</P>
<P>The set is bristling with problems and tension. The young actor, who is
the star of Kruger's film, Davie Drew (Hamilton), is depressed that he
is a failure as an actor. He is further incensed when at a screening
party, his beautiful Italian girlfriend Veronica (Lavi), goes back with
Jack to his hotel. This leads the young actor to attack Jack with a
knife and then run away from the set. The two struggling actors will
learn that they can't depend on anyone else and will resolve to finish
the picture with a clear understanding of each other.</P>
<P>The sexy Carlotta, Jack's troublesome ex, is in Rome, being kept by a
tycoon, flaunting her rich lifestyle and tempting Jack to come back with
her and also be kept by the tycoon. Through his longing for her and fear
to let go of her completely, Jack will have to face all the things from
the past that he has been running away from, as he asks himself: How
could a man go wrong and not know it?</P>
<P>When Kruger has a heart attack, he takes over directing the film and
gets it done on time. But since he changed some of the script, the
hospitalized Kruger and his harpy wife blame him for trying to take the
picture away from him.</P>
<P>Jack lets go of both his dependence on Kruger and on Carlotta and is now
prepared to return to Hollywood as a director.</P>
<P>While the topical story is about the business and cynicism involved in
making a picture, and the vanity of those in the field, its deeper
concern is with understanding the personal nature of failure,
insecurity, and disappointment. The film borders on soap opera but
manages to get beyond it because of the intelligent discretion of
Minnelli in his directing and the fine acting from the two male leads,
with Robinson's performance being nothing short of brilliant, enough to
lift this film on his shoulders alone to a loftier dimension.</P>
