<PRE>                                    BAD BOYS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Tea Leoni, Joe Pantoliano,
           Tcheky Karyo.
Screenplay:  Michael Barrie & Jim Mulholland and Doug Richardson.
Director:  Michael Bay.</P>
<P>     Gnaw on this factoid for a moment:  BAD BOYS was originally a
project with Dana Carvey slated to play one of the leads.  That is
not a misprint.  Dana Carvey.  And if you think about it long
enough, you will realize why BAD BOYS never had a prayer of being
anything more than mediocre, and in fact turned out quite bad.  It
is the classic case of a shell plot intended to do nothing more than
showcase the star's familiar comic routine.  BAD BOYS is an
amazingly boring action film, and will be funny only to fans of
Martin Lawrence and/or Will Smith.</P>
<P>     Lawrence and Smith play Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowry, two
Miami narcotics officers with very different personalities.  Marcus
is a home body with a wife (Theresa Randle) and three kids; Mike is
a player with a steady stream of lady friends.  They do share a
problem, however...a fortune in heroin from one of their busts which
has been stolen from the police station by mastermind Fouchet
(Tcheky Karyo).  The case becomes complicated when a witness (Tea
Leoni) to a pair of murders committed by Fouchet and his goons calls
for help, setting in motion a sequence of events in which Marcus is
forced to pretend he is Mike.  Meanwhile, both Mike and Marcus try
to track down Fouchet before he re-sells the heroin to mobsters.</P>
<P>     I'll tell you exactly what kind of movie BAD BOYS is.  It is
the kind of movie where anything that *can* blow up, *will* blow up.
It is the kind of movie where glass exists solely to be shattered,
either by bullets or by bodies; in one hilariously idiotic example,
a glass aquarium is mounted in the wall of a nightclub, allowing a
convenient view of the inside of the men's room as well as providing
a ready-made breakable item.  It is the kind of movie where a
misinterpreted phone conversation turns into an episode of "Three's
Company."  And it is the kind of movie where a guy in a wheelchair
gets knocked over by the villain just so you know that he's *really*
a villain (he probably doesn't recycle, either).  In short, it is a
collection of every conceivable action film cliche, right down to
the high-strung police captain (an incessantly screaming Joe
Pantoliano).</P>
<P>     Don't expect much better from the characters.  Martin Lawrence
has the role with the most potential, the family man playing the
part of the sexy bachelor, but he completely butchers it.  The part
requires someone capable of a little restraint, someone who appears
uncomfortable acting smooth and seductive.  That someone is *not*
Lawrence, who is full of swagger and attitude.  Falling back on his
popular stand-up and sit-com persona might prove popular with his
die-hard fans, but others will wonder exactly how he is supposed to
be different from Mike.  Marcus is a part that actually requires
some acting ability, and Martin Lawrence doesn't have much.  Will
Smith *does* have acting ability, and plenty of it, but he really
takes a back seat to Lawrence.  When he is allowed to show his
frustration with the mess Lawrence is making, of his house and his
image, Smith is quite good, and there is actually some energy in BAD
BOYS.  Those occasions, however, are all too rare.</P>
<P>     The simple truth is that, basically, BAD BOYS is trying to
showcase Lawrence and Smith the way BEVERLY HILLS COP showcased
Eddie Murphy, and a coherent plot would just get in the way of the
jokes.  There are clearly a lot of people who think Martin Lawrence
is funny, but I am not one of them.  It is just depressing watching
him bug his eyes at the suggestion that he is gay, or fumbling for
an explanation when his wife catches him in a lie (which,
incidentally, exists only as a lame plot device).  While Will Smith
can be quite funny, he becomes something of a straight man to
Lawrence, and that is a real misuse of his talents.  BAD BOYS is a
generic action flick full of pointless slow-motion shots by director
Michael Bay and heavy use of orange filters by cinematographer
Howard Atherton, sporadically interrupted by Lawrence and Smith's
profane version of the traditional buddy film odd couple.  BAD BOYS,
even worse movie.</P>
<PRE>    On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 bad boys:  2.</PRE>
