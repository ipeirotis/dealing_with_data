<P>In 1977, something never though possible happened.  The film Star Wars was
released, with extraordinary, never seen before techniques of special effects. 
The film set a new standard for special effects in film.  Not only did it set a
standard for the special effects, it set a standard for film itself.  The plot
is one of the most creative I heard ever.  The legend of Star Wars starts long
ago with the Jedi.  The Jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side.
 Darth Vader is the leader of the dark side.  Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Sir
Alec Guinness, was one of those Jedi who is still alive today.  Darth Vader was
once a Jedi, until he turned to the dark side.  Years after the killing of the
Jedi, Darth Vader is still around causing trouble.  </P>
<P>R2-D2 and C-3P0 are both what we call "driods", or robots that are of
assistance to humans.  While an attack on the ship that Princess Leia, played
by Carrie Fisher, is aboard, she inserts a message to R2-D2, who is also on the
ship. to Obi-Wan Kenobi pleading for help.  The Princess is captured by Vader,
but R2-D2 and C-3P0 get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the
remote planet of Tatooine.  The Jawas, or small creatures who sell droids, pick
R2-D2 and C-3P0 up to sell.  They are bought by Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill)
family.  While Luke is cleaning the droids, the message from Princess Leia is
found.  Luke finds this Obi-Wan Kenobi, and learns that Obi-Wan was a friend of
Luke's father, who is now dead.  Luke also learns his family was a Jedi.</P>
<P>After Luke's family is killed by tropps from the dark side, Ben decides to put
Luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all. 
Ben wants to create a new Jedi.  First, the two must find Princess Leia and
serve her.  Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, and his sidekick Chewbacca,
played by Peter Mayhew, are consulted about providing a ship to complete the
tasks necessary.  After meeting up with Leia, the film really picks up.  Luke
continues his training as a pilot and to become a Jedi, Ben Kenobi confronts
Darth Vader, and many other interesting events occur. </P>
<P>Star Wars is an amazing epic.  The plot is so original and amazing, I cannot
believe it.  The special effects, especially for its time, are wonderful and
realistic.  The space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch.  The
ships flown by all are very unique and creative.  The costumes are also out of
this world.  The scenery is so different from anything I have ever seen before.
 There are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with
me forever.    </P>
<P>The entire premise of Star Wars is amazing.  The creatures and droids that we
see throughout the film are one of a kind.  Even the human characters are
different.  Every character is extremely likable and different from characters
from other sci fi films.  The acting on everyone's part is great, especially
that of Sir Alec Guinness's.  </P>
<P>Even though the concept is not realistic at all, it is pulled off very nicely. 
The acting, setting, effects, costumes, and sound make it work.  If any of
these were messed up, Star Wars would have come off as one huge joke.  The
ending works very well, and left it very open to the sequels that came
afterward.  In early 1997, a special edition of Star Wars was released.  The
film was re-mastered so it looked better than it did in 1977.  A few creatures
were added here and there, and even an entire deleted scene with Han Solo and
Jabba The Hutt (seen in Return Of The Jedi) was added to the film.  Think
that's enough?  On May 19, 1999, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace will
be released, followed by two more films that will reveal what went on before A
New Hope.  With this, Star Wars is bound to become the greatest tale told in
our time.</P>
<PRE>The Bottom Line- One of the most original, fun, best movies of all time.       </PRE>
