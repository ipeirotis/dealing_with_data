<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A war film set inside a Southern boot-camp during the Vietnam War era. Joel
Schumacher's modestly budgeted, gritty looking war melodrama had nothing
relevant to say, only saying things that have been said in countless other
Vietnam war films. The clichéd hero and the formulaic story never caught my
fancy, no matter how much the director tried to make things happen. It's in the
style of the first half of Full Metal Jacket, but without the same impact. </P>
<P>It's the tale of a soldier who won't conform to the Army and by the film's end
proves he's not a bad guy and can also be an excellent soldier if he wants to.
In his stance as a rebellious leader, he helps many of the recruits in ways the
hypocritical Army trainers can't. There were just no surprises forthcoming, as
the film seemed to be marking time until it shows him as a leader and proves
himself heroic. </P>
<P>I think that Schumacher thinks because he has no stars and shot this one in a
grainy 16-millimeter with a jumpy hand-held camera and with mostly natural light
in Dogme style, that he caught something cinema vérité. What goes with
Schumacher wherever, is a lot of corn. This film is just as weak in storyline as
was his big commercial flick Batman. </P>
<P>What this film has going for it, is some good shots of the swampland in Fort
Polk, Louisiana, and some good performances. The star is Colin Farrell, a young
Irish actor who is able to speak convincingly with a Texas twang and be
charismatic as the rebel soldier with the attitude problem. </P>
<P>The movie tracks a Vietnam-bound platoon as its members progress from their
eight-week basic training course to their ninth week of training at a stopover
site called Tigerland; after that week they will ship out to 'Nam. Tigerland is
a hellhole that comes with a swamp replica of 'Nam, and is known by the Army men
as "the second worst place on earth." The officers refer to it as "the stateside
province of Vietnam." </P>
<P>Raymond Bozz (Farrell) is a cocky, troublemaking private not conforming to the
strict 
discipline his drill instructors expect of him in 1971. He and his fellow
recruits are all heading for Vietnam after they complete their training and are
tired of being constantly reminded that this training will save their life. </P>
<P>The movie seems phony almost immediately, as Bozz and Paxton (Matthew Davis) -
an opponent of the war who enlisted for the experience - pick up a couple of
gals in a topless bar and take them to a cheap hotel for some quick sex. As soon
as they're done with the sex, the G.I.'s start to philosophize man to man and
the idealistic Paxton tells of his desire to write a great war novel. The women
split as soon as the men start chatting and the two are soon back in camp to
face their dauntless company commander, Captain Saunders, and all their drill
instructors who go through the gruff routines of preparing the men to kill. </P>
<P>Bozz knows all the angles in the Army base' bureaucratic procedures and uses his
knowledge to help his fellow soldiers beat the system, as he advises some on how
to get out of the service. The cadre can't wait to graduate this smart-ass from
boot camp and get his ass into Vietnam. </P>
<P>The movie moves along as if it were on a forced march to Hanoi. There's also
some liberal claptrap thrown into the storyline, which is unconvincingly done
about a racist sociopath. In a Deep South boot-camp, strangely enough, he's the
only racist to be found and the only coward. </P>
<P>The film heads toward its less than 'Big Bang' finale in Tigerland with the same
forced messages about war that could not only chase sluts out of a hotel room
but drive film critics to the theater's popcorn vender rather than sit through
this torture in its entirety. It's a movie all about male-bonding, how the
hipster white dude Bozz can rap with the black dudes who are naturally hip and
sure know how to sing, and of how beautiful all the men look when they have a
splatch of dirt on their faces. The director must receive credit for at least
getting together a good cast, though I would have loved to see this one with a
Ed Wood Jr. cast. </P>
