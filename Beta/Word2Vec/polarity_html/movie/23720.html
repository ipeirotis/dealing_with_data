<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A wonderful film. Mike Leigh's valentine to the theater. It is a
stunning period film on Gilbert and Sullivan, the remarkably successful
and unique British musical duo during the Victorian era, whose
partnership ran from 1871 until 1896.</P>
<P>This 160-minute musical epic (just right in length--the film was never
dull for a second), moves at its own very satisfying speed, enhanced by
the magnificent musical arrangements of Carl Davis and replete with many
hilarious episodes (it's a very funny film). It also has an opulent
cinematography by Dick Pope, the eye-pleasing stagework of Gary Yershon,
the just right costumes by Lindy Hemming and the impeccable performances
by all concerned, with special kudos to Jim Broadbent as the constantly
sulking and cranky librettist William Schwenk Gilbert. Allan Corduner,
as the bon vivant, genius musical arranger Sir Arthur Sullivan, and
Timothy Spall as the lead baritone Dickie Temple, are outstanding in
their supporting roles.</P>
<P>Gilbert being the more business-minded partner, is therefore relegated
to being the watcher of the box-office receipts. He is also the
demanding stage director and the one with the self-effacing humor;
while, the newly knighted Sullivan, is noted for his artistical
integrity and of exuding pleasure in his work while performing, always
smiling when conducting, even when coming off a sick bed to make the
opening of a show. His mannerisms encourage a sense of gaiety for
everybody around him.</P>
<P>The rest of the troupe, made up of many Leigh regulars, were all superb,
including Shirley Henderson (a singer with problems offstage), Dorothy
Atkinson (a soubrette), Wendy Nottingham (as the wizened business
manager), Eleanor David (Sullivan's lover with the know-how to take care
of her pregnancy problem independently) and Martin Savage (the troupe's
star, highest paid performer and drug user).</P>
<P>The film opens in 1884, with the D'Oyly Carte (Cook) production of the
flop Princess Ida and will end with the much regaled The Mikado, a
virtual goldmine for the two artists, that was first produced at the
Savoy Theatre in 1885. After Ida, Gilbert was dubbed by the critics "the
king of topsy-turvydom" (Topsy-Turvy was a successful play that Gilbert
wrote, one that his critics and Sullivan are accusing him of repeating
its staid formula in his newer works). Sullivan, at the same time,
decided to stop writing music for light comic operettas and tried to
reinvent himself, taking time off, due to an illness, for a vacation to
France, which included a visit to a bordello. But he was determined when
he returned to London, to do only serious musical compositions. It isn't
until D'Oyly Carte forces together the meeting of the two enormously
rich and famous personalities he has under contract for the Savoy, who
are coming off 10 straight hits, does Gilbert realize how serious the
rupture in the relationship is.</P>
<P>Leigh makes this into a story about what happens backstage: capturing
the arduous
process of creating a Gilbert and Sullivan show from scratch, accurately
depicting the petulance of the actors, the reality of the business side
of show business, those dreaded rehearsals, and all the delicate
balancing of egos that come into play, as the director pushes for the
performances he wants. It couldn't be more real or more tempered with
total affection for what the actor and writer must go through to get
what they want out of their work. It is as good a story about the
backstage happenings as any in films, and is so much superior than
Shakespeare in Love, which basically did the same thing last year and
was rewarded with an Oscar.</P>
<P>The Gilbert and Sullivan reversal of misfortune begins when the prim
Gilbert's somewhat frustrated wife (Lesley Manville) coaxes him to see a
London exhibition on Japanese culture, where he watches a sword fight,
drinks green tea, views kimonos and the Kabuki. Returning home inspired,
he has his servant hang a Japanese sword over his doorway and in a
moment of great significance, when the sword falls to the floor, and
after feeling blue by being dumped on by critics and Sullivan, he
regains his lifeforce; it is like a moment of 'satori', as he glides
confidently through the air with the sword and thusly The Mikado is
born. It was amazingly well done to watch his facial and bodily
transformation from one of a grouch to unmitigated joy in an instant, as
his love for his work is written all over him.</P>
<P>As "The Mikado" goes into rehearsal, Gilbert forcefully directs the play
and the actors are just as brilliantly daunting whether rehearsing or
cavorting backstage, or performing for an audience. One of Leigh's pet
themes over the years, is for actors to do improvisations. The actor
works with the director to help enact the work, and this teamwork is
exemplified, as Gilbert listens to the cast when they tell him to put
back the Mikado song he removed from Dickie.</P>
<P>Gilbert intimidates them in his own inimical way to pronounce words like
"persiflage", to walk like the Japanese do, and to stop wearing corsets.
His meaty part couldn't be played to greater perfection, in a
performance that is memorable, making it difficult not to think of
Broadbent whenever the name Gilbert will now be mentioned. He won Best
Actor at the 1999 Venice Film Festival. Topsy-Turvy captured Best
Director and Best Film honors in the New York Film Critic Awards.</P>
<P>But with the success of The Mikado, Gilbert tells his wife that he can't
handle such happiness, "There's something inherently disappointing about
success." This is the same Gilbert who calls his mother "the vicious
woman who bore me into this ridiculous
world."</P>
<P>Musicals don't get any better than this offbeat one. Leigh directs like
the master he is, someone who is at the pinnacle of his career. He is so
sure of what he is doing, the film is so well researched for
authenticity without having to put the film in a period straight jacket,
that it retains a refreshingly modern attitude despite being properly
set in Victorian times. Leigh has so definitively caught the orneriness
of the two huge personalities, arguably the very best writer-composer
team ever, that he doesn't even have to mention their famous courtroom
dispute over a carpet in the Savoy Theater that fractured their delicate
relationship for three years until they reunited thereafter, but were
never successful again. The beauty of the film, making it so much more
than the typical musical, is that the director caught the environment of
Victorian society, allowing it to add a socio-historical perspective to
the backstage dramatics of the theater people and to the travails of the
G & S partnership. This historical perspective was depicted, by flashing
the newspaper headline of the death of General Gordon and his men in the
Khartoum massacre on the screen and then the film zeroes in on some
actors stuffing themselves on oysters, basking in the bourgeois society
the Empire has made possible for them and so many others in England.</P>
<P>But the director's main point wasn't political as it usually is, he
merely wishes to show what a colossal effort it is to put on a stage
show and that G & S individually would have undoubtedly found great
success alone, but it is only with their collaboration that their
success is so magnificent, and that we should be grateful for what their
partnership gave the world. I'm also grateful that Leigh made this film.
I felt just wonderful leaving the theater. I knew that I saw something
special.</P>
