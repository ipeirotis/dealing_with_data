<PRE>***1/2 out of four</PRE>
<P> Starring Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Liv Tyler, Chris O'Donnell, Charles S.
Dutton. Rated PG-13.</P>
<P>Robert Altman's Cookie's Fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on
sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good. It is a
sunny, delightful, dreamy comedy, filled with lovely performances, skillful
direction and topped off with an understated, clever, extraordinary script.</P>
<P>As this is an ensemble piece, it is forced to start of slowly as it
introduces us to its characters, all of them residing in a southern town
called Holly Springs. First we meet Willie (Charles S. Dutton), an honest man
with a slight drinking habit. We then see that Willie takes care of an
elderly lady nicknamed Cookie, who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is
being filled with loneliness, despair, and want of her dead husband. We cut
to Camille (Glenn Close) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister
Cora (Julianne Moore). Then we briefly get acquainted with Emma (Liv Tyler),
an apparent relative of Cookie, who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast, still
full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live. We also
fleetingly see Emma's lover Jason (Chris O'Donnell), an ambitious but far too
excitable young cop.</P>
<P>We are now about one quarter through the two hour picture, and Robert Altman
decides that it is time to set the plot in motion. We see the ecstatic Cookie
stare hopefully at a picture of her husband. She exclaims "Here I Come!" and
then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself. Soon after, her niece
Camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl, comes upstairs, finds Cookie dead
and flips out. Convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have
none of that in her family, she eats the suicide note and convinces her
slightly slow (yet sweet) sister that it was a murder. She makes sure that
she stages it like a murder as well; scattering jewelry all over the floor,
breaking a few cabinets, windows and doors, and then throwing the gun out in
the back yard.</P>
<P>The only reasonable suspect is Willie, who immediately gets taken into
custody, and put in a jail cell (they all know he didn't do it, so the cell
stays open and he plays Scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful Emma).
Meanwhile, the unperturbed Camille continues her none-too-subtle
manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same
time making her Easter play a success.</P>
<P>So begins Cookie's Fortune, a film aptly described by critic Scott Renshaw as
"a southern spin on Fargo," except that this one is far funnier and much more
enjoyable than the Coen brothers' darker, somewhat disturbing and slightly
overrated escapade. Robert Altman's slight picture is in some ways
reminiscent of something like Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil as
well, in that both films focus (on and off) on the eccentricities of the
residents in a southern US town. Indeed, most of the characters in Cookie's
Fortune are loads of fun to observe, and a portion of them are fascinating
and surprisingly multi- dimensional.</P>
<P>Glenn Close turns in an insubstantial (in terms of her career) but
magnificent performance as the conniving Camille and is also the source of a
good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie, and she is
perfectly cast as the prolific "Aunt Alexandria" character, endlessly
obsessed with family dignity. The equally essential role of Willie is handled
with an intangible grace by veteran thespian Charles S. Dutton (Mimic, A Time
to Kill)</P>
<P>There is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy
inside hours, even days after the film ends. Cookie's Fortune is such a
movie. I loved the light, kindhearted approach Altman (whose last project was
the dark, intense drama The Gingerbread Man) took towards the tricky subject
matter. I enjoyed the talented ensemble cast. I even liked the trite "In the
south everybody is related to everybody" cliche that is inevitably employed
by the time this movie draws to a close. I'm not sure why Cookie's Fortune
had such an all-around pleasing effect on me. Perhaps it's that good ol'
southern charm.</P>
