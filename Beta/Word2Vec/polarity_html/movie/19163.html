FAMILY RESEMBLANCES (UN AIR DE FAMILLE) (director: Cédric Klapisch;
cast: Jean-Pierre Bacri (Henri), Agnes Jaoui (Betty), Jean-Pierre
Darroussin (Denis), Catherine Frot (Yolande), Claire Maurier (Mother),
Wladimir Yordanoff (Philippe), Fr.-1996)</P>
<P>This biting family drama hones in on the anxieties and turbulence a
dysfunctional modern French family experiences, eventually uncovering
all their unhappiness, but not much else is offered as for plot
surprises.</P>
<P>Philippe (Wladimir Yordanoff) arrives for a family gathering, at his
brother Henri's (Bacri) modest Sleepy Dad's café, fresh from a
television appearance which he has been very nervous about, wanting to
make a good appearance since he represents his company in this two
minute interview on a newscast. He, being ranked only as the number 4
person in his company, takes this assignment as a sign that his company
is very pleased with him. He is fishing around his other family members
for compliments. What he gets in response, is not quite what he wants to
hear. His 30-year-old unmarried and motorcycle jacket wearing sister,
Betty (Agnes Jaoui), tells him that he stutttered. His domineering
mother (Claire Maurier), who adores him over the other children, tells
him she didn't care for his tie. His simple but nice wife, Yo- Yo
(Frot), who is celebrating her 35th birthday with this family gathering,
agrees with his mother. Henri, who is considered the idiot of the
family, didn't even watch the show, but agrees with his sister.
Jean-Pierre Darroussin, the self-effacing waiter, Denis, was reading
during the show. He gets caught up in the family dramatics throughout
their evening gathering, having most of all a love interest in Betty.</P>
<P>It is directed by Cedric Klapisch, a former N.Y.U. film student, who has
a knack for making wry observations regarding relationships. This
realistic film is based on a play written by two of the actors here, Ms.
Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri. In fact, this entire ensemble cast also
acted in the play. It takes place entirely in the restaurant Henri
inherited from his father.</P>
<P>What is a constant of the story line, is that the matriarch of the
family is always nagging at everyone, saying it is normal to be doing
what she is doing. Thusly, she has turned her favorite son into this
obnoxiously pampered child. He kisses ass in the business world,
condescends to his siblings and treats his gentle wife with contempt.
The price of the mother's indiscretions in handling her children, is
that the family members feel either slighted or neglected or spoiled.
She explains Henri's dour disposition and lack of ambition away, with
the ridiculous comment that she knew he would amount to nothing because
he was a late walker. All this becomes tedious after awhile, though I'm
sure it accurately portrays how some bourgeoisie families are. What I
was waiting to see happen, was something momentous or inspiring, but
that never really occurred. Instead, what happened was that this drama
went on cruise control, with a functional dialogue and characters who
really did seem to resemble each other after awhile.</P>
<P>The basic plot revolved around the problems the children have. Henri's
wife left him, and Philippe is too self-absorbed about his place in the
business world to see what is happening in his marriage, and Betty can't
get into a decent relationship. Each is unable to relate to others in a
loving manner. Henri's paralyzed dog (which was kept around as a
decoration) was seen as a symbol of how the mother crippled the entire
family. The only gleeful moment in the film came when Yo-Yo drunkenly
kicked off her shoes and danced a fast dance with Denis.</P>
<P>Nonetheless, this was a somewhat satisfying if not too sobering of a
film experience. It really is a film that can't stop being a play, and
to its detriment it can't do anything to alter that structure.</P>
<P>It is through small changes in character development that the film
succeeds best. And isn't that the way it is in real life? This
claustrophobic production, done in real time over the course of one
evening, understands that. It did offer one scene, in particular, that
caught my fancy. When Yo-Yo was given her birthday presents, it was fun
to see who gave her what. Betty, the disgruntled rebel, gave nothing.
The mother gave the most horrible and insensitive gift you can to
someone who is not a dog lover. She gave her a gift certificate to
purchase another paralyzed dog.Yo-Yo, to her credit, couldn't feign
delight. Her husband followed with his gift of ajeweled choker that she
mistook as a choker for the dog. This was the funniest moment in the
film, and it did seem to give the characters renewed wind to charge into
its final moments. The film's bleakness was somewhat lessened when we
see the bookish Denis and the outspoken Betty riding off together on a
motor scooter, hopefully to live together happily ever after. As the
simple Yo-Yo commented on seeing that friendship, she's lucky to have
such a nice guy. It seems everyone but the snobbishly recalcitrant and
ever nagging mother learned a little something this evening about
themselves. Betty, that she can love someone. Henri, that he must learn
how to relate to his wife better, who may or may not return to him.
Yo-Yo, that she is entitled to speak her mind. And, Philippe, that he is
unhappy even though he considers himself to be the success of the
family.</P>
