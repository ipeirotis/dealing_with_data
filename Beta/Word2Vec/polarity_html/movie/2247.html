<PRE>                                    MY LIFE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Michael Keaton, Nicole Kidman, Haing S. Ngor.
Screenplay/Director:  Bruce Joel Rubin.</P>
<P>     It seems clear that Bruce Joel Rubin has a death fixation.  Or
more precisely, a life after death fixation.  After the smash romantic
thriller GHOST and the suspense mystery JACOB'S LADDER, Rubin had
already staked his claim to status as Master of Metaphysical
Melodrama.  Now comes his feature directorial debut, MY LIFE, which
again ventures into issues of life and death.  The results are
extremely mixed.  When MY LIFE scores, it scores big; when it misses,
it misses big.</P>
<P>     MY LIFE opens with public relations man Bob Jones (Michael Keaton)
beginning a very important project.  Suffering from terminal cancer
while his wife Gail (Nicole Kidman) is pregnant with their first child,
Bob decides to make a series of videotapes so that his unborn child
will know its father.  However, as the project progresses, Bob realizes
that he may not be the man he thinks he is.  In fact, there are parts
of his childhood he can't even remember.  A visit to a Chinese faith
healer (Haing S. Ngor) leads him to examine the unresolved issues of
his past, including his stormy relationship with his parents (Michael
Constantine, Rebecca Schull) and brother (Bradley Whitford).  As he
senses his time running out, Bob struggles to face his failings and
disappointments, and to rediscover his life while he still has it.</P>
<P>     To his credit, Rubin avoids the glycerine-soaked excesses that
plagued GHOST.  This isn't a big-screen version of a "disease of the
week" TV-movie; it's a contemplative, almost spiritual story buoyed by
the small but crucial role of the healer played by Haing S. Ngor.  Ngor
projects a serenity which permeates the film, the effect of his
splendid scenes with Keaton lingering long after the scenes themself
end.  In fact, MY LIFE may be surprisingly over-subtle when it requires
a moment of real catharsis.  Too much of Bob's struggle is kept beneath
the surface, and as a result I was left with a truckload of questions
about who Bob Jones really was.</P>
<P>     By far, the best thing about MY LIFE is Michael Keaton.  Those who
remember his impressive performance in CLEAN AND SOBER know that Keaton
can be a fine dramatic actor when he has good material, and MY LIFE
provides him with some fine moments.  The best are those which play to
his cocky comic sensibility.  There is real charm to the scenes of
Bob's videotaped instructions to his yet-to-be-born son on such vital
issues as shaving, basketball and entering a room.  When it comes to
the more serious elements, Keaton doesn't have as much to work with.
MY LIFE is supposed to be about a change in Bob Jones' life, but we
don't get a clear enough picture of who he was before his illness to
make it evident that there has been a change.  Rubin ignores the basic
dramatic rule of "show, don't tell" by having another character say
that Bob "isn't exactly an example of an examined life."  That's a
quality I just don't feel I *saw*.</P>
<P>     MY LIFE also caught me just as I had reached my breaking point in
terms of tolerating saintly cinematic wives/girlfriends with no
discernible personalities of their own.  Nicole Kidman's Gail is a
complete blank, spending far too much of the time radiating dangerously
high levels of understanding.  I was left completely untouched by the
crucial love story because I never believed that there were two human
beings involved.  Instead, I saw one human being and one porcelain
figurine with lots of hair.  Kidman's one genuine moment, a very funny
line in the middle of Gail's labor pains, was shocking because it was
the first time Gail seemed to be made of flesh.  The fact that it's
Bob's story doesn't mean that Gail can't be well-written, and she is
not.</P>
<P>     In spite of my distaste for the love story, I was ready to be far
more positive in my recommendation of MY LIFE until its final fifteen
minutes.  The conclusion is too drawn out, and Rubin inexplicably has
Bob's big moment with his parents played out over the phone.  After a
solid opening, alternately entertaining and introspective, MY LIFE just
peters out.  Bruce Joel Rubin the auteur didn't have enough other
people pushing him to flesh out his characters or fill in the holes in
an otherwise affecting story.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 months to live:  6.</PRE>
