<PRE>HABIT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     "Two tickets for the ride of your life," Anna says to her newfound
lover Sam.  The tickets she bought him are just for the Ferris wheel,
but she is indeed about to take him on the ride of his life.</P>
<P>     The confident and creepily sexy Anna, played perfectly by
cinematic newcomer Meredith Snaider, is a mysterious seducer and an
erotic lover.  "I suspect that the less you know about me, the longer
you'll stay interested," she tells Sam after refusing to tell him what
she does for a living - she says she doesn't think it's relevant to
their relationship.</P>
<P>     The likeable but alcoholic Sam, played with fascinating complexity
by Larry Fessenden, the film's director and editor, is an unlikely
romantic lead with his unkempt hair and his missing front tooth - he
lost it in a bar fight.</P>
<P>     "You're very compulsive," Anna tells Sam soon after she meets him.
"Actually, I'm committing suicide on the installment plan," replies the
always soused Sam.</P>
<P>     Most movies telegraph their punches from the beginning, but in
this one it isn't clear for quite a while where it's heading or even
what genre it belongs to.  Although made for just $60,000, the high
levels of the acting and the realistic location sets have the look of a
much bigger budget film.  This is indie film making at its best.  It is
a high quality production but willing to take the risk you expect
outside of the Hollywood system.</P>
<P>     Frank De Marco's cinematography is full of somber, nocturnal
shadows, and its frantic pace captures well Sam's anxiety.  His filming
of the Ferris wheel scene turns a generally harmless ride into one
terrifying experience for a man like Sam with a fear of heights.  He
hunches over to one side as Anna views his fear with quizzical
disbelief.</P>
<P>     The director said that he was making a film about "the ambiguity
of life."  Certainly the love affair at the picture's center has almost
more ambiguity that Sam can bear.  "Men fall in love," the calmer of
the two, Anna, reflects.  "They don't stay in love."</P>
<P>     The two leads have genuine but unhealthy chemistry.  Even as Sam
becomes increasingly scared of Anna, she, like his drinking, is a bad
habit he cannot shed.  Their sex scenes are graphically erotic albeit
sometimes quite bizarre, and Sam keeps going back for more even when he
begins to understand the consequences.</P>
<P>     The slow yet always mesmerizing film has few faults.  Only the
ending, which turns a bit schlocky, disappoints.</P>
<P>     HABIT runs 1:40.  It is not rated but should be NC-17 for graphic
sex, full-frontal nudity, violence, and drug usage and would be
suitable for teenagers only if they are older and mature.</P>
