<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This most uncompromising film is based on the Britisher J.G. Ballard's
1973 novel Crash. The theme is about sex, death, and technology. But
what this Canadian film is trying to say about those subjects, is
anyone's guess. My guess, after seeing this film three times, is that it
is not trying to say anything that is revelational, but it takes a car
crash -- something no one in their right mind can revel in and think
they are sexually getting off on -- and depicts a sexual fetish cult
that finds a car crash to be as stimulating as a sexual act. It is a
film probing how strange the mind is, especially in this post-nuclear
age; and, how sex is created in the mind, and how sexual fetishes are no
stranger than anything else conceived there.</P>
<P>In lieu, of a regular storyline, the film consists of a series of
obsessive scenes regarding car crashes and of having sex in a car. It is
the kind of film that one will either love or hate.  One thing can be
said with a certain amount of reassurance, the film is a faithful
adaptation of the book, even keeping the monotonous mood of the book's
repetetive themes played out over and over again. At the 1996 Cannes
Film Festival, where it got mixed reviews of boos and cheers from the
crowd, it nevertheless received a special jury prize for "originality."</P>
<P>The film has something to say that comes in the form of a veiled warning
about the future of technology and the potential deepening
psychopathology that is needed for a more benevolent humanity. It has
caused ripples of controversy, not because of any theme it might have,
but because of the sex scenes in the cars, its crossing of old moral
boundaries in favor of pornography, and the way the film unfolds without
a visible story. Its naysayers said, it would encourage viewers to have
sex while driving in their car, thereby causing accidents. Ted Turner,
who owns the rights to distribute the film through his ownership of Fine
Line, said he hated it. All I could say to those arguments  --  is
horsefeathers! If that's a legitimate reason to ban or knock a film, you
might as well censor almost every film made as presenting some danger or
another.</P>
<P>In the modern skyscraper city of Toronto, James Ballard (James Spader)
produces TV commercials while his wife Catherine (Deborah Unger) either
works at the airport or just likes to hang out there. Their marriage is
an open one, with each exploring sex in novel ways with other partners
and with them then acting out what they did with their other partners.
While James has sex with a member of his film crew during a break, his
wife draws herself listlessly over the nose of a plane parked in an
empty hangar and strips to her bra while rubbing her breasts against the
plane. From behind her, an unknown seducer kisses her thighs and mounts
her backside while she writhes her body against the glacial metal of the
plane.</P>
<P>James is not fully alert after his busy workday when driving home to his
high-rise apartment on the slick highway road. When he bends down to
retrieve some papers, he loses control of the car and it goes over the
white dividing line as he spins out of control and collides head-on with
a car going in the opposite direction. While the driver of the other car
goes through the windshield and dies instantly, the passenger, Dr Helen
Remington (Holly Hunter), survives along with James. They both receive
injuries and are taken to the hospital. James has his leg pinned
together by metal rods and walks with a limp. When in the corridor,
someone who appears to be a doctor but isn't, Vaughan (Elias Koteas),
starts to examine James in detail and in particular checking out the
scars on his body. James willingly submits to this examination without
checking for credentials or even asking him who he is, even though the
examination was a highly suspicious one. James acts as if he is a zombie
with a perpetual hard-on for women, scarred men, and cars crashes.</P>
<P>Going back to the junkyard to look at his crashed car, James meets
Helen, who has also come to look for her car. The two get together and
find that they have much in common due to the crash. They get along so
well, that James says he will drop her off at the airport, where she
works as a doctor for immigrants. He is driving his new car, which is
the same model car he crashed. They both complain about the increase in
traffic since their accident, when suddenly James loses control of the
car and it hits the railing on the highway. This near-accident seems to
sexually excite them, so they stop at the airport garage and have wild
sex in his car.</P>
<P>One evening, James, Helen, and Catherine attend, what can only be
described as a show that has an unusual theme, even for performance
theater. Vaughan, it turns out, is a car crash freak and scarred
survivor of many car crashes. He has restaged the 1955 car crash of
James Dean down to the exact details for his act. Colin Seagrave (Peter
MacNeill), a professional stunt driver, acts as James Dean, while
Vaughan acts as his German mechanic who accompanied him to an auto race
in Salinas, California, on that fatal September 30th date. They will be
driving the exact replica of the Porsche sports car with the number 130
on it that Dean drove when he broke his neck, as they simulate the crash
with the college student, being acted by another stunt driver, who is
driving the other car that he crashed into.</P>
<P>After the show abruptly ends because traffic cops rush the set, James,
Catherine and Helen join with Vaughan and Seagrave, who got a concussion
from the crash, in the nerve center that they operate together out of
Seagrave's house. Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette) is the companion of
Vaughan, wearing leg braces and a full-body black leather suit for
support. Vera (Swarts) is the loving wife of Seagrave, helping him
prepare next for the Jayne Mansfield accident he is anxious to stage.</P>
<P>When Vaughan is asked by James, what he's about! he replies: "I'm
intimately involved in reshaping the human body by modern
technology."The group then watches some video tapes of car crashes and
masturbate to it, while sitting on a couch. Hey, I've got no problems
with them so far, but it seems more funny than it is serious...though
there is something intangible about the emptiness of this film and its
unwillingness to deliver any expected messages or cater to the masses
demand to be entertained, that makes this film intriguing in a very
special way.</P>
<P>If the film disturbed or was meant to disturb, I can't really say that
it disturbed me. It's a speculative work, like a test project, trying to
see what it can come up with that works. That there is such a thing as
someone having a car crash sex fetish like those in the film, seems
unlikely. But that doesn't seem to matter. What matters is that this
film is looking for something to say about the modern world and the new
kind of strangeness it has developed.</P>
<P>The film seems to be like a research scientist probing clinically for
answers he is not sure of, by asking questions he is not sure of, only
he is trying to solve a problem that he is sure exists. That everyone is
dehumanized in this film, might be the point of it. The acting, for what
the actors were asked to do-- that is, all act in an emotionless fashion
except for the bizarre portrayal by Koteas, is accomplished rather
successfully. Spader and Unger are a beautiful couple, pushing the
sexual envelope in their intimate but cold relationship. Both have
accepted their imminent death as a way of life and are comfortable with
their peculiar relationship. Their thrills come from breaking through
sexual taboos and knowing they care about each other even if they appear
to be distant. Hunter is like them- dehumanized to a certain point, she
seems to be interested in her own sexual self-satisfaction above
anything else, and her near-death experience seems to have reinforced
that need. Koteas is a freak who yearns only for liberating himself
sexually through the near-death experience of a car crash. He loves so
much what he is doing, that it becomes infectious to others, and like
any charismatic leader, there seems to be always others who will follow
him.</P>
<P>For me, the story might be perceived as being more voyeuristic than
controversial. It defies having a label attached to it. Somehow, it drew
me into its audacious storytelling. I am not annoyed to be put in the
position of being a voyeur, as much as I am amazed by how all the
cultists respond to their lives. The film itself is daring because it is
different than other films, it covers ground where mainstream films dare
not go; its repetitiveness, its hermetic and absurd nature, make for a
film that I like better than how it is perceived through all the hype it
has received. I enjoyed it because it was so well-made and acted, and
strangely enough, for a film that some criticized as pornographic, I
found it to be in the best of taste. What it lacked was definition and
perception, and a sense of getting out of its own awe-inspiring way.</P>
