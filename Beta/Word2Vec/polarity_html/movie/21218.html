<P>Life is Beautiful (La Vita e Bella) is an example of a good movie that 
people have decided to make great. Do not be mistaken, it is not the 
best foreign fare of 1998, nor even close to the finest (my personal 
favorite being the Iranian Taste of Cherry). But the movie is a solid 
work and wholesome reminder of the Holocaust. The film follows a father 
and son through a concentration camp, and shows the father's attempts to 
ease the son's pain by convincing him it is all an elaborate game. 
Roberto Benigni won best actor for this production, just one of many 
undeserved awards that the movie garnered. Yet, the work is still leaps 
and bounds superior to the recent Jakob the Liar and the best Italian 
film to make it across the Atlantic since the 1994 romantic masterpiece, 
Il Postino.</P>
