<P>     When one thinks of Scandinavian movies, the name of Ingmar Bergman 
leaps to mind.  The great Swedish director's films were almost always 
austere, beautifully-made, and intellectual (sometimes to a fault).  As 
a result, those whose expectations for JUNK MAIL are based on Bergman, 
are in for something of a shock.  This movie, the product of Norwegian 
first-time director Pal Sletaune, owes more to David Lynch and Denmark's 
THE KINGDOM than it does to the work of Bergman, Troell, or any other 
notable Scandinavian film maker.</P>
<P>     Most of the film takes place in the seed, dirty, and dreary 
backrooms and alleys of Oslo, and the characters are like rejects from 
Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL.  And, although JUNK MAIL threads its way through 
a series of potentially-serious issues, Sletaune keeps the tone comical 
(albeit darkly so).  In many ways, this is a strange movie; I liked it 
in spite of the characters, who could charitably be called unpleasant 
losers, and in spite of the grungy atmosphere, which seems to have 
soaked into the bones of everyone populating the picture.</P>
<P>     JUNK MAIL generated an incredibly strong buzz at last year's 
Toronto Film Festival (where I had originally planned to see it).  It 
tells the story of the laziest, most inept mailman in the world, a 
weasel named Roy (Robert Skjaerstad).  Roy doesn't take his job very 
seriously - he opens letters, throws away mail, and does everything 
possible to invade the privacy of his the men and women he is supposed 
to serve.  Instead of faithfully delivering parcels and envelopes to 
their rightful destinations (see Kevin Costner's THE POSTMAN if you want 
this kind of mentality), he dumps about half of his load so he can spend 
hours loafing.  One day, however, his curiosity gets him into a 
precarious situation.  While snooping around the apartment of Line 
(Andrine Saether), an attractive-but-deaf girl he has fallen for (and 
who unwisely left a set of keys where Roy could get his hands on them), 
the mailman becomes involved in a complicated crime that involves 
robbery and murder.  And, although Georg (Per Egil Aske), the main 
villain, is inept, he is also extremely dangerous, and willing to kill 
without compunction to obtain the results he desires.</P>
<P>     Not surprisingly, the standout performance in JUNK MAIL belongs to 
Robert Skjaerstad, who manages to make a worm like Roy seem believable.  
>From time-to-time, we actually find ourselves feeling something close to 
sympathy for him.  Andrine Saether is pleasant as Line.  Per Egil Aske 
plays Georg as a cross between a conscienceless sociopath and a bumbling 
idiot.  He's deadly, but a little too stupid to be truly frightening.</P>
<P>     This edgy, entirely original movie succeeds for a couple of 
reasons:  it isn't afraid of breaking the rules (the lead character is a 
pathetic loser who never finds redemption) and it never overexplains 
itself to the audience.  It's a fresh, quirky picture that will appeal 
to anyone looking for something that, as MONTY PYTHON put it, is 
completely different.  The only real downside is that the conclusion is 
a little too open-ended to be fully satisfying.  Up to that point, 
however, JUNK MAIL is an entertainingly offbeat experience.  It's 
unclear whether this will get any kind of widespread U.S. distribution, 
but it has already become, and will likely continue to be, a film 
festival favorite. </P>
