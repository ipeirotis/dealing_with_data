WHO THE HELL IS JULIETTE? (Quién diablos es Juliette?)
(director/writer/cinematographer/editor: Carlos Marcovich; screenwriter:
Carlos Cuarón; cast: Yuliet Ortega, Fabiola Quiroz, Victor Ortega,
Michel Ortega, Salma Hayek, Oneida Ramírez; Runtime: 90; Kino
International; 1997-Mexico)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An irreverent documentary about a childishly giggling and seductive
16-year-old prostitute living in the Havana barrio of San Miguel del
Pradon. The Juliette of the title is Yuliet Ortega, who searches for her
identity through those who know her best: her neighbors, family and
friends. They are interviewed and relate in a colorful way what they
know about her. What is refreshing, is to see how shameless she is about
her prostitution; which, she sees as only a way for her to survive. She
is also seen in a bold light offering her impulsive opinions about
anything, which sometimes are so blunt that they hit the mark, whereas a
more educated person might not have been able to say what she did in
such an offhand manner and gotten away with it.</P>
<P>What this film has going for it, are its originality of story line, the
brashness of the star and of the 35-year-old Mexican director, Carlos
Marcovich, and the unpredictability of where the film is going. The
problem I had with it is, at times, I lost interest in the flighty
story. There was one too many scene of Yuliet (that's how she spells her
name) looking at the camera and inanely giggling into it as if she was a
special ed student being questioned by her perplexed but understanding
teacher. This film closely resembles what a free-spirited college
student could do on a videocam, though here every scene looks
beautifully shot and all the improvisationals have an air of
professionalism about them. But I wouldn't go overboard in praising the
brashness of the film, as it seems to be based on very low expectations
for what a movie should be about. Its entertainment values are easily
met by the overall zestiness of the film and its zany characterizations,
which give the film a look of rebellion; but, its failure to uncover an
interesting story or have characters with more mature views, makes this
film seem flimsy.</P>
<P>This unorthodox, non-linear film, impulsively examines the lives of two
close friends, who both have never met their fathers, Juliette and her
23-year-old friend, a sultry green-eyed model from Mexico, Fabiola. The
movie moves haphazardly from settings which include Cuba, Mexico, Los
Angeles, New York and New Brunswick, N.J.. It moves in the same zig-zag
fashion in going to different people for some Yuliet info via the
interview format, such as her father Victor living in New Jersey whom
she hasn't seen since she was a baby, who suddenly shows up on her
doorsteps with the help of the director's arrangements and says, "I'm
your father." She replies, "I didn't know you'd be so ugly." In truth,
her mother became despondent after a disappointment with her current
lover and committed suicide by setting herself on fire. This came when
Yuliet was very young, and it was only one year after Victor left. She
doesn't completely warm up to her father, but does seem interested in
seeing him. His story of why he left, differs from her mother's. He said
he went to America, risking his life on the sea, to better provide for
his family and expected her mother to follow. He is now an electrician,
living with another woman and their family in the suburbs of New
Brunswick.</P>
<P>The film is loose and brash, filled with youthful exuberance and energy;
it constantly introduces peripheral characters, such as neighbors,
relatives, and casual acquaintances, into the story, who add a
cartoonish flavor to it. But the film is too scattered to mean much. It
resonates only in flashes, as scenes change on the go before anything
could be developed.</P>
<P>Yuliet's younger brother Michel is made fun of for being a Christian and
a masturbator, but when he's on camera he appears to be a serious young
man. There are a few earthy interviews with Yuliet's grandmother, who
raised the troublesome child and resorted to beating her constantly,
even once cracking her skull open with the heel of her shoe.</P>
<P>Whatever hope there is for Yuliet, is shown when she travels to Mexico
on Fabiola's recommendation to a modeling agency and has a tryout there.
This real-life look at Yuliet
took place in the years from 1995-1997. Her story has some merits...if
the film's superficiality doesn't get under your skin. The director,
noted as being a rock video cinematographer, took a risk with this one,
because he comes pretty close to coming up with nothing. I would have to
say that he won, getting away with a very slight film that is full of
energy thanks to the veracity of Yuliet's performance and the hectic
rhythmical ways he filmed the story, which gives the film its poetical
strength.</P>
