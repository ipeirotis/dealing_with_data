<P>Midway through "Anaconda", documentary filmmaker Terri Flores (Jennifer 
Lopez) turns to a co-worker and says "I thought this movie would be my 
first big break. Instead, it's turned into a disaster." Truer words have 
never been spoken.
"Anaconda" is a monster movie with a lousy monster. It's a suspense film 
that is utterly predictable. It's a mess The film does manage to drum up 
some scares, but only in the most elementary way, like a jack-in-the-box. 
As you turn the crank, you're totally aware that the damn clown is going 
to pop up, but somehow it's still mildly startling when it happens. The 
main difference between the giant snake in "Anaconda" and the clown in a 
jack-in-the-box is that the clown is more realistic. "Anaconda" boasts 
some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years. 
Animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe-
inducing robots you've endured at Disney World. But it's the computer 
animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame. In one 
shot, a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree 
near a waterfall, but the giant snake springs out and loops around its 
hapless victim in mid air. The scene, if done well, would have been a jaw-
dropper. Here, the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than 
a Saturday morning cartoon. What's really amazing is that the filmmaker's 
were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the 
promotional trailers for the movie. 
But enough about the phony snakes. Now it's time to talk about the lousy 
story. Heroic and very pale anthropologist Eric Stoltz leads a 
documentary film crew down a Brazilian river in search of the Shirishama 
Indians, a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the 
rain forest. Stoltz tells his crew "Pray that you didn't forget your bug 
spray." Apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff, because 
they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no 
ill effect.  Along the way, the group rescues a whacked-out lapsed priest 
(Jon Voight) who claims to know how to find the Shirishama. Within 
minutes, they throw away all their plans and follow Voight down a 
tributary into the land of creepiness. From that point on, the film is a 
hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from "Jaws" and "Dead Calm."
One of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of Eric 
Stoltz. Early in the story, his character gets knocked into a coma by a 
river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious. So 
why did they hire an actor of the caliber of Stoltz for what amounts to a 
cameo appearance? Also, why did Stoltz, who generally selects his roles 
with great care, agree to appear in this crap? Ah, the mysteries of 
Hollywood.
The remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to 
happen. Jonathan Hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous Englishman hired 
to narrate the documentary, but Lopez and Ice Cube manage to rise above 
their cardboard characters. Lopez, who starred in "Selena," is an 
enormously appealing performer, possessing a vibrancy that makes even the 
most trite lines seem credible. Ice Cube has a special charisma; an 
ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously. 
There's also a special twinkle in his eyes, as if he's gently mocking his 
own tough-guy posturing. 
But the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of 
Jon Voight. Obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas, Voight 
plays the villain in thick accent, with a series of leers and hisses, 
spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of "Jonny 
Quest." At one point, he looms over the crew and says "The anaconda is 
the perfect killing machine. It strikes, wraps around you, holds you 
tighter than your true love. And you get the privilege of hearing your 
bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode.
" That moment is so high-camp that it almost made the film tolerable. 
Almost.
Fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out "Anaconda." Don't. 
There are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer, 
including another "Alien" sequel. Wait for them, rent "Jaws" in the 
meantime, and don't throw away your money and time on drivel like this.</P>
