<PRE>"The Apostle" (USA, 1997)
A Film Review by James Kendrick
**** (out of ****)<HR></PRE>
<P>Director: Robert Duvall || Screenplay: Robert Duvall || Stars:
Robert Duvall (Euliss "Sonny" Dewey), Farrah Fawcett (Jessie
Dewey), Miranda Richardson (Toosie), Todd Allen (Horace), John
Beasley (Brother Blackwell), June Carter Cash (Sonny's Momma),
Walt Goggins (Sam), Billy Joe Shaver (Joe), Billy Bob Thornton
(Troublemaker) || MPAA Rating: PG-13<HR></P>
<P>True faith and its expression through organized religion is a
difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on, which
is probably why so few of them do it. Even the most religious
directors - like Martin Scorsese or Ingmar Bergman - usually
address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit
religious terms.</P>
<P>So it's not hard to see why it took Robert Duvall fifteen years
to get "The Apostle" onto the big-screen. As a matter of fact,
even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial
backing, and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own
money. He also wrote the script, directed the film, and starred
as the central character, a fiery Texas preacher named Euliss
"Sonny" Dewey. Few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity
to take on that kind of financial, technical, and creative
responsibility single-handedly, and it's testament to what an
intensely personal project this was for Duvall. And, thankfully,
every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into
power and honest emotion.</P>
<P>Sonny is an energetic, Pentecostal preacher who has been speaking
(actually shouting) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve.
He spends much of his time traveling about the country,
evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals. Unlike most
Hollywood characterizations of intense preachers, Sonny is not a
phony or a swindler, and the film's purpose is not to unearth
hypocrisy and sin in either Sonny or the church. Duvall makes it
abundantly clear that Sonny truly believes in what he says,
although like all humans, he has weaknesses.</P>
<P>One of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that, not
only does his long-suffering wife, Jessie (Farrah Fawcett), want
to leave him for another man in the congregation, but the two of
them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher. Faced with
the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his
family - that same raw power that allows Sonny to get entire
congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent
temper. At his son's baseball game, Sonny snaps and smashes his
wife's lover in the face with a baseball bat, inflicting a wound
that may be fatal.</P>
<P>Not knowing what else to do, Sonny disappears. He throws away his
identification, drives his car into a lake, and takes a bus to
Louisiana, hoping to start over again. In the tiny, mostly poor
coastal town of Bayou Boutte, Sonny once again finds his calling.
After befriending a simple auto mechanic (Walt Goggins) and
tracking down the town's ex-minister (John Beasley), Sonny sets
up his own church, The One Way to Heaven Temple. Re-christening
himself as "The Apostle E.F.," he quickly draws together an eager
congregation, and together they realize real change in each
other's lives. But, always, Sonny's past is lurking a step behind
him, waiting to swallow his progress.</P>
<P>Duvall has made his intentions in making "The Apostle" clear. In
a recent article in "Newsweek," he wrote: "Filmmakers hardly ever
depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the Holy
Spirit, and when they do, it tends to be patronizing - full of
charlatans and snake handlers ... But what I really wanted to do
was try to understand what these preachers go through and what
they believe, and to portray it in an accurate way."</P>
<P>The strength of Duvall's convictions turn out to be the strength
of his film - "The Apostle" always rings true, even in the most
painful moments, because we know he's being sincere with the
subject matter. After fifteen years of traveling the country,
listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking
studious notes on what they said, Duvall has captured the energy
and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual.</P>
<P>His Sonny is a man who speaks directly to God and expects to be
spoken right back to. "I've always called you Jesus and you've
always called me Sonny," he says. When neighbors call and
complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants
with the Man Upstairs, Sonny's mother (June Carter Cash) just
hangs up on them because she knows there's no sense trying to
interrupt him.</P>
<P>The main theme to emerge from "The Apostle" is the fact that good
can come from any situation. Sonny's act of violence toward
another human being is inarguably a horrific thing, and Duvall
never shrinks from that fact. However, that very same act of
violence is what brings Sonny to Bayou Boutte, where he finds
people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him.</P>
<P>In his short time in Louisiana, he does a world of good, and when
the police finally show up to take him away, he goes quietly,
knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him.
And, as a scene during the final credits shows, he even turns his
punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment.
It is that strength in Sonny's character that makes him so
appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed, but he is
powerful enough to overcome those flaws. Weak men are the ones
who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better
themselves.</P>
<P>Watching Duvall on-screen, it's not hard to imagine that he would
have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation
over acting. As Sonny, he completely inhabits the character, and
his performance is certainly the best of the year. Because he
spent so much time absorbing the traits, methods, quirks, and
personalities of real preachers, Duvall was able to create a
complete character who always feels indelibly human.</P>
<P>As a director, Duvall feels that less is more. His camera simply
takes in what goes on in front of it, with very little intrusion.
There are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive
close-ups. Duvall knew that the power of the film's characters
(enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non-professional
churchgoers and actual ministers) didn't need to be artificially
enhanced. In this way, "The Apostle" almost plays out like a
documentary, not only in its technical simplicity, but more
importantly, in its sense of reality.</P>
