<P>     The amazing thing about Sebastian Junger's best-selling non-fiction
book THE PERFECT STORM was that it created an enthralling, page-turning
story out of two less-than-pulse-pounding subjects: fishing and weather.
Even more surprising, perhaps, was the manner in which he chose to make
those subjects readable. Rather than creating a de facto novel about the
people involved in the events, Junger dives into journalistic detail. He
immerses the reader so completely in the hard lives of swordfishermen as a
culture that it's never necessary for him to over-dramatize the individual
lives he's focusing on. As for the weather, he is similarly successful at
creating specifics out of generalities. For Junger, tension and adventure
came from the simple facts.</P>
<P>     Screenwriter Bill Wittliff, in adapting THE PERFECT STORM, did not
choose journalistic detail. Instead, he chose melodramatic twaddle. The
time is October 1991, and the Gloucester, Mass. swordfishing boat Andrea
Gail has just returned to port with a less-than-stellar catch, leading
Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney) to attempt one more run before the
season ends. Fishing the Grand Banks is dangerous in the late fall, but
Tyne and his five crewmen -- including relative newcomer Bobby Shatford
(Mark Wahlberg) -- head into the tricky waters anyway. Little do they know
that a hurricane is brewing near Bermuda, and that it's heading straight
for two other East Coast weather systems. An unlikely confluence of events
finds the Andrea Gail ready to head home just as the three systems
collide, stranding them at sea in the middle of a once-in-a-century
maelstrom.</P>
<P>     It's not an easy job Wittliff has taken on, because there's no
obvious through-line for Junger's account to take as a screen story.
Wittliff anchors his script with the relationship between Bobby and his
loving girlfriend Christina (Diane Lane), with token attention to the
personal lives of other Andrea Gail crew members like divorced Murph (John
C. Reilly) and romantically inept Bugsy (John Hawkes). The book
effectively conveyed the personal and physical toll exacted by a
fisherman's life, and for a while it appears that Wittliff is pointing the
story in the right direction. He sets up Tyne's recent run of hard luck, a
run he fears may cost him his boat if he doesn't pull in a big haul this
time around; he sets up Bobby's conflict over whether he can give up
fishing to settle down with Christina. THE PERFECT STORM could have been
set up as a seafaring TWISTER, with stick figure characters wrapped in
cool meteorological special effects. This film, at least, has its heart in
the right place.</P>
<P>     Its dialogue, however, could not be more wrong, wrong, wrong. Perhaps
panicked over how to make a journalistic account "engaging" for viewers,
the makers of THE PERFECT STORM apparently gave Bill Wittliff the
following instructions for writing his characters: "Imagine a particularly
bad romance novel with a $100 million budget." The people in THE PERFECT
STORM talk to each other like no human beings on the planet have ever
spoken to each other, let alone the taciturn folk of a New England fishing
town.  They say things like, "There's only love;" they say things like,
"You're heading right into the mouth of the monster!;" a rescue jumper
screams "Jonesy!" into the storm after a fallen comrade. For all the
verisimilitude Wittliff pumps into the conversations, the fishermen might
as well have spent two hours growling "Arrgh, matey" to one another. </P>
<P>     If not for the thrillingly staged final hour, THE PERFECT STORM might
have been a total loss. As it stands, it's just on the border of worth a
look. Director Wolfgang Petersen stages the Andrea Gail's perilous journey
with the kind of tension that finds you pulling yourself into a ball in
your seat; there's also a strangely effective scene involving a mid-air
refueling attempt for a rescue helicopter thwarted by the intense winds.
It's purely visceral film-making, mind you, but it's very good visceral
film-making, and at least you don't have to worry about listening to the
next ridiculous thing to come out of someone's mouth. It's ironic, because
THE PERFECT STORM had the potential to be a powerfully human story in
spite of showy visual effects and adventure set pieces. Instead, it's only
worth watching for its visual effects and adventure set pieces. The storm
itself is perfect; the purple prose journey towards that storm makes you
long for a bit more journalistic distance. Or at least for someone to
fiddle with the sound mix so the wind drowned out every word.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 hurricane farces:  5.</PRE>
