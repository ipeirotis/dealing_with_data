<P>     PRACTICAL MAGIC cast a sort of spell over me, but I don't think it's
the kind a film-maker might have intended.  Rather than enchantment, it
produced a Spell of Befuddlement.  It's not so much a movie as it is a big
bubbling cauldron of confusion into which a mess of ingredients have been
tossed.  Among the items included in this concoction:</P>
<P>     1) A cup of THELMA & LOUISE.  The story focuses on a pair of sisters
(genetic, not just philosophical) named Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian
(Nicole Kidman) Owens, who come from a long line of witchcraft
practitioners including the maiden aunts (Stockard Channing and Dianne
Wiest) who raised them.  Part of that legacy involves a curse on the men
in their lives, leading Sally into a tragic longing for true love and
Gillian to a pursuit of loveless affairs.  The whispers of THELMA & LOUISE
come when the two sisters kill an abusive lout (Goran Visnjic) while his
is in the process of assaulting Gillian.  The women then try to hide from
the repercussions of their deed, even as good-hearted cop Gary Hallet
(Aidan Quinn) tries to help them.  It's an obvious hook for a female
empowerment fable, one that plays female viewers for every whoop and cheer
it can wrest out of them, but it doesn't quite mix with other ingredients
like...</P>
<P>     2) A dash of THE FRIGHTENERS.  You see, Sally and Gillian don't just
kill the abusive lout once.  They kill him accidentally, cast a spell to
bring him back to life, then kill him a gain when the zombie-fied lout is
even more loutish than before.  The catch is that his restless soul is
still hanging about the sisters' picturesque New England home, appearing
occasionally to inhabit Gillian's body or attempt to hear out Gary's
heart.  Though the scenes of supernatural nastiness are sporadic, they're
nonetheless jarring.  As the Owens women attempt a climactic exorcism of
sorts -- joined by a bunch of townswomen who had until that point loathed
the sisters, but decided to help out because, darn it, that's just what
women do for one another -- you may wonder who took your saucy romantic
comedy and dipped it in THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK.  That's assuming you
still care by that point, given...</P>
<P>     3) A smidgen of HOPE FLOATS.  Sandra Bullock now appears to be in her
pensive, sorrowful single mother phase, and it doesn't suit her.  In the
midst of the magical hijinks surrounding her, Bullock plays her mourning
far too straight, as though the film were a deeply observational
relationsihp drama.  She should have taken a hint from her co-stars, all
of whom appear to be having a heck of a lot more fun.  Kidman is flashy,
fiery and sexy as the naughty sister, playing town tramp with plenty of
gusto; Channing and Wiest are both matronly and devilish as the eccentric
aunts.  Bullock, meanwhile, puts on her horn-rims from LOVE POTION NO. 9
and frumps about when she should be providing the stable, sympathetic
figure the story needs.  And it could have been a strange delight thanks
to...</P>
<P>     4) The eye of Griffin Dunne.  Actor-turned-director Dunne has a
unique, dark comic sensibility behind the camera, evidenced by his ability
to turn a tale of two obsessive stalkers (ADDICTED TO LOVE) into an
entertaining romantic comedy.  Here he offers a few of his cock-eyed
touches, including a midnight tequila party and Gillian's surreal
time-lapsed drive home, but there's no focus to the story.  It's a comedy
that gets too serious, a crowd-pleaser that turns too bizarre, and a
romantic love story that suddenly turns into a sisterly love story.  It's
certainly never a bore, not with Kidman throwing off sparks and so many
shifts in tone.  It also never comes together as anything more than the
sum of its disparate parts.  I'm not sure what the recipe for PRACTICAL
MAGIC was supposed to create, but it adds up to a casserole of clashing
flavors, a supernatural stew with the power to create a fog of
ambivalence.</P>
