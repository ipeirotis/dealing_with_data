<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A poorly crafted revenge action film, that seems to be satisfied with itself for
being so muddled and image conscious. Gonin is a slickly done visual treat in
bizarre behavior and violence, with homoerotic overtones. This is a nonstop
action flick styled after those recent Hong Kong action films of John Woo, Ringo
Lam, and Tsui Hark. Since I'm not a fan of the originators of this genre, I'm
especially not partial to their imitators. "Gonin," which means 'the five,' is
devoid of character development and a coherent story, or anything but mindless
blood-and-gore and an outpouring of jump-cuts and fast editing. But even with
all those filmmaking tricks of the trade, the action scenes seem like they're in
slo-mo when compared to the Hong Kong ones. </P>
<P>The plot involves five 'regular' citizens who rob the powerful Ogoshi yakuza of
over 100 million yen. They are then relentlessly hunted down by two psychopathic
hitmen, who pursue them till they get them all. </P>
<P>The five men who dare to carry out this foolhardy mission are in desperate need
of cash. Their leader is a gay disco owner, Mr. Bandai (Sato), who owes the
yakuza 100 million yen and is threatened if he can't pay them. He plans to pay
them back with the money he steals from them. To do this he randomly recruits an
ex-detective kicked off the force for gambling and now working as a bouncer in a
strip joint, Hizu (Jinpachi Nezu); an unemployed loser who can't face his family
because of his financial failures and has an awful giggle, Ogiwara (Naoto
Takenata); a stuttering pimp with bleached blond hair who loves a Thai
prostitute, Jimmy (Kippei Shiina); and, the busboy lover of Bandai, the
shakedown male hustler Mitsuya (Masahiro Motoki). Bandai manages to pull off the
heist despite how inept his gang is. </P>
<P>But the yakuza hire two hitmen to hunt them down. One of them is the patient
brute, wearing an eye patch, Kyoya (Beat Takeshi Kitano). The hitmen quickly
locate all of them  since the gang fails to cover-up their identities properly,
and the film becomes a vehicle for showy performances. Kyoya is gay and the
lover of the other hit man Kazuma, and he is fearsome. In one scene he appears
holding a blue umbrella in one hand and is blazing away with his gun in the
other hand. The only memories from this film are of the gruesome kind, as
killing is the thing here and director Ishii--who used to illustrate
manga--hyperrealistic, action-packed Japanese comics--goes all the way with this
theme by making it into a cartoonlike story. There's definetly an audience for
this type of cultish film, except don't count me as one of those happy viewers.
I prefer my violent flicks to make a little more sense and have at least some
character development. Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs looks like a Shakespearian
classic compared to this B-film, one that hopes to get by with its all-star cast
and the menacing performance by the indomitable Takeshi "Beat" Kitano. </P>
