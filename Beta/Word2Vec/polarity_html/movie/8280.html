<P>     Part documentary, part narrative fiction, WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY=20
represents one of the year's most offbeat approaches to a character=20
study.  Set in Paris' Bastille quarter, Cedric Klapisch's film offers an=20
involving, occasionally poignant portrait of an insecure twentysomething=20
woman named Chloe (Garance Clavel).  At the same time, the movie=20
examines the changing face of the city, as trendy shops replace older,=20
family-run businesses, supermarkets supplant Mom and Pop stores, and=20
apartment buildings are renovated to cater to a younger crowd.  Indeed,=20
although Klapisch doesn't dwell upon Paris' gentrification, it=20
represents one of his film's important subtexts (watch for the highly=20
symbolic scenes depicting the destruction of an old building).</P>
<P>     It's no accident that much of WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY has a "real" feel=20
=96 many of the supporting performers, who are playing themselves, are=20
amateurs with no previous acting experience.  In fact, Klapisch was so=20
intrigued by the colorful secondary characters that he greatly expanded=20
the movie's length (it was originally devised as a 20-minute short) to=20
take advantage of their presence. =20</P>
<P>     WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY begins with the search for a lost animal, but=20
develops into something more sublime and revealing.  At the film's=20
opening, we meet Chloe as she is making final preparations for her first=20
vacation in three years.  Up to this point, however, she has been unable=20
to find anyone to care for her beloved cat, Gris-Gris.  Her gay=20
roommate, Michel (Oliver Py), is unwilling to put himself out, so she is=20
forced to ask around the neighborhood.  Her inquiries lead her to Madame=20
Renee (Renee Le Calm), a known cat-sitter.  Chloe leaves Gris-Gris with=20
the elderly woman, then leaves for two weeks at the seaside.  She=20
returns to learn that Gris-Gris has run away, leaving Madame Renee in a=20
state of near-panic.</P>
<P>     The film progresses with Chloe searching the neighborhood for Gris-
Gris.  In the process, she meets many of the people who live nearby, but=20
with whom she has never come into contact.  There's a shy, insecure=20
young Arab named Djamel (HATE's Zinedine Soualem) who is more than=20
willing to help Chloe as she scours the streets, a grungy musician=20
(Romain Duris) who catches her eye, and, most memorably, a group of=20
Madame Renee's friends, all of whom seize upon this minor emergency as a=20
means of adding spice to routine existences.</P>
<P>     As she interacts with neighbors for the first time and later sits=20
alone at home, listening to her roommate entertaining a lover, Chloe=20
becomes aware of her own isolation and loneliness.  Suddenly, WHEN THE=20
CAT'S AWAY is no longer about finding Gris-Gris, it's about Chloe=20
discovering meaning in her life.  The cat becomes a metaphor for=20
companionship, and Chloe opens herself to emotional risks she would not=20
normally consider in an effort to find someone with whom she can=20
connect.  Her plaintive question of "Why am I all alone?" is one that=20
many individuals across the world can relate to. =20</P>
<P>     Klapisch's decision to rely upon many unproven actors has mixed=20
results.  Some of them are clearly raw, occasionally delivering lines=20
awkwardly.  Others, on the other hand, such as the eccentric Madame=20
Renee, are natural performers, and they provide the film with some of=20
its best comic sequences.  WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY's real revelation,=20
however, is newcomer Garance Clavel, who is hypnotizing as Chloe.  Not=20
only is Clavel an excellent actress with expressive features, but she=20
has an undeniable screen presence.  The camera loves her, and it's=20
obvious that one reason we become so attached to Chloe is because of the=20
way in which Clavel brings her to life.</P>
<P>     WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY claims a premise so simple that it's easy to=20
wonder how a full length feature could be developed from it, but the=20
results are profound and moving.  There's a little bit of Chloe in all=20
of us, I think, and that's why it's so easy to relate to this searching=20
young woman.  Klapisch injects enough comedy to keep WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY=20
light, but not so much that he turns it into a farce or dilutes the=20
film's dramatic content.  This picture is yet another unconventional=20
French export worthy of notice, and is a welcome addition to the=20
season's movie schedule.</P>
