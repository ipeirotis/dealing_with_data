<P>LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL (director:Roberto Benigni; cast: Roberto Benigni
(Guido), Nicoletta Braschi (Dora), Giorgio Cantarini (Giosue), Giustino
Durano (Uncle), Sergio Bustric (Ferruccio), Horst Bucholz (Dr. Lessing),
1998-Italy)</P>
<P>There is no question that one has to be careful about the good taste
required when making a so-called comedy film about the Holocaust, not to
offend those who have suffered enough already, but that proves to be no
problem here, as Benigni went to some Jewish Organizations prior to
shooting the film and got their blessings for this project. Besides, I
don't think there are any sacred subjects that can't be touched, it is,
ultimately, the quality of the film itself that counts. And if there is
another reason for not disapproving offhand the film's comic handling of
this horrific context, then let's bring up the example of Charlie
Chaplin in the THE GREAT DICTATOR, though not directly about the
Holocaust, nevertheless, it was a light comedic parody of  "The
Fuehrer", and it was considered by many, not only to be an appropriate
film, but one of the all time great films.The later part of the
assessment of that film, is in recognition of that film's tremendous
power to satirize Nazism. Benigni's film just can't muster that same
power, because it has muddled and sanitized its telling of the story too
much, as well-intentioned, as he might have been in trying to tell the
story, the power in the telling of it is just not there.What is there,
are bits and pieces of the Holocaust's human story, that is as horrific
a story as any one can imagine, and offers some contribution to
understanding the affects of the Holocaust. What he just doesn't make
clear, is that the Italian Fascists were part of the "Final Solution."
They were not joking around about killing Jews. The proof is the large
number of Italian Jews who were killed in the Holocaust. Benigni's film
offers no explanation for this. A much better and truer film than his,
that unfailingly tells about the Italian culpability in the Holocaust,
is THE GARDEN of the FINZI-CONTINIS (1971), which didn't waste the
audience's time trying to amuse them with childish antics, instead
stayed true to what was happening to the Jewish families in Italy.</P>
<P>LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, is the line Trotsky said, before he was about to be
assassinated, serves as the rosy title for such a downbeat subject, that
is played in a hearfelt and sincere manner, even though, what it offers
for Nazi atrocities is for the most part the mildly anti-septic kind,
reminding me of  STALAG 17, or HOGAN'S HEROES TV series where the Nazis
are pictured as cartoon buffoons.</P>
<P>Having a horse painted green, marked as a Jewish horse, makes for a
colorful scene and segue to elopement for Guido (Benigni) and Dora
(Braschi), but in no way begins to symbolize or explore the deep rooted
hatred that would lead to a policy of genocide. To find such truths, go
way beyond the scope of this comedy star vehicle, which, instead, uses
this serious subject matter for Benigni to contrast his Charlie Chaplin
like routines with the threat of genocide that is ominous, while
following a story line that will not try to offend anyone, probably not
even the Nazis, that much, especially since Benigni calls this story a
fable, giving him an excuse to invent what he wants for the film. Let me
tell you, the Holocaust was no fable. But yet, because the subject
matter is so deadly serious, he is, at least, able to reach a more
general audience, drawn to see such a film they would have most likely
not seen, but see it because of Benigni's comic ability, and in the
process, he has vouchsafed for them how insane the world's prejudice
against Jews has been, as he makes the film's efforts seem worthy
enough, even if that were all this film would accomplish, that would be
plenty. But I believe he does accomplish more, but he does it,  by
distorting history, until, in the end, he does show the horror and
tragedy of the Holocaust, in his own inimical way.</P>
<P>In the first part of the film, if you did not know that Benigni's Guido
was Jewish, you certainly couldn't tell, since he just seemed like he
was an eccentric, motor-mouth Italian. So, in that sense, this film in a
round-about way, is erasing that stereotyped prejudice some people might
still have about Jews being so different from others.</P>
<P>I was not offended by seeing comedy routines take place in a
concentration camp; I also was not touched as I should have been with
the gravity of the situation, due to the comic effects. And if any one
in their right mind thought that by playing some silly child game in a
concentration camp they could survive, I got a surprise for them, it
ain't so.</P>
<P>The book that gave me a very truthful and precisely frank look at the
daily lives of those in such predicaments, is the one by the Italian
chemist and former concentration survivor, Primo Levi, whose
autobiographical, "I Survived Auschwitz," shows what it really was like
in those camps.That book touched me, even more than the truest film to
date that I saw about the Holocaust, SHOAH, did. After you read that
book, there can be no illusions that you are in for a game in the park
when you are interred in such a camp. Though the Italian Jews had it
easier than the others brought to the camp, because they came there
pretty near the end of the war and therefore were not subjected to long
torturous years of suffering, nevertheless, it was a place where the
survivors looked like skeletons and felt as if they were already dead.</P>
<P>The film is really made up of two parts, each with a very different feel
to it. The first part consists of lushly created cinematography, as it
tells of the clownish, hyper antics of Guido, as he is an Italian
country boy, coming to the Tuscan city in a brakeless car, where he is
mistaken for the Italian king as he whizzes by a crowd awaiting the
king, holding his arm out accidently in a Nazi salute to keep the crowd
away, this is in 1939. For most of this part of the film we don't even
know if he is Jewish, until we see the green horse and, later on, see
the sign on his bookstore saying this is a Jewish place, since he seems
to be in some denial mode of what is really going on around him.</P>
<P>Amid a whole bag full of slapstick jokes, which probably never go out of
style, since the audience where I watched the film, howled with
uncontrollable laughter at all the corny bits, leaving me to wonder why
I can't muster a laugh. There must be something funny about this
physical humor, after all, there is a long line of vaudeville  comedians
who made people laugh for generations doing those schticks. I guess,
this kind of comedy is just not my cup of tea, and if others find it
funny and because of it, find the film endearing, then it is just a
question of differing tastes. Though, quite frankly, I did think most of
the bits were embarrassingly crass; for instance, those contrived scenes
where he keeps bumping into his future wife, and the switching of hats;
and, the egg- in- the- face routine, I found to be especially tedious,
since I find him to be more energetic and a master of good timing than
outright funny. But, I also, must say, the first part of the film was
easy to watch, it seemed to have a smooth and even flow to it.</P>
<P>Guido immediately finds romance with the wealthy school teacher, Dora,
(who is his real-life wife). It's too bad she can't act, but then again,
this is basically a one man show, so really, she just becomes another
one of his props, much like a leading lady in a Marx Bros. movie is
used, as a diversion to balance their comedy routines. Guido's romance
is complicated by Dora's engagement to a local Fascist bureaucrat, which
gives Guido a chance to pull every string in our hearts, as he goes
about winning her love from the typical comedy film foil, her
buffoonlike Fascist lover plays. This material is shamelessly old hat,
it is only effusive because the star is so frenetic and nimble and
manipulative on screen. But there were also some clever bits, like his
speech, though not original, it still hit the mark, as he pretended to
be a school official, giving a talk on racial superiority to elementary
students where Dora teaches, using his body as an example of all his
superior Fascist parts, such as his belly button, which is a good
Fascist one. Guido does this, while working for his uncle as a waiter.</P>
<P>When the scene changes from the greenhouse he enters with Dora after
their elopement, and it is now 1945 and he is happily married to her,
the tragedy of their situation finally hits home, and part two of the
film turns grim, as the loving father of a five-year-old, is arrested by
the Fascists and along with his son, is taken cattle-style by train to
the camp. His wife who is not Jewish, is not arrested, but she insists
on going to the camp with them. In order for the father to allay the
child's fears, he says it's all a game and who ever scores 1,000 points
will win a tank, a real one. This prize is valuable to the kid whose
favorite possession at home is his toy tank. This game idea could
probably work for as long as a train ride from Italy to Germany, but for
anyone to think it could work inside the camp, that would be ludicrous
on their part to think so. The camp they were in, seemed more as if it
were a coal mine then a death camp, and Guido was stuck with a bad coal
miner's job, with really rotten bosses and working conditions. The Jews
in the camp looked so well fed, that it was hard to believe that they
were in a concentration camp.</P>
<P>The kid was perky and wide-eyed and intelligently precocious, just right
for the part, and the only other person who caught my attention in a
multi-dimensional performance, where you could at least find some
variable expressions on their face, was Horst Bucholz, as a Nazi doctor,
who was waited on by Guido in his uncle's restaurant and is now a doctor
in the camp, insensitive to Guido's new position in life, but still
showed enough cognition for him to save his life by making him a waiter
in the camp. Everyone else said their lines in a flat monotone voice
that projected bad acting and because of that, almost made a mockery out
of their roles. Naturally the comedy routines did not work inside the
camp, except for the bit where Guido translates the rules of the camp
for the German guards, as he makes it seem to the kid that what he is
reading are the rules for the game they are playing, as he explains that
the guards are only acting mean because they are part of the game. No
one laughed in the audience, but this was funny in a way that you
wouldn't laugh out loud funny. Some slapstick was tried, such as Guido's
comically high stepping walk, but that got no laughs. But mostly, for
this part of the film, the emphasis became on this game he was playing
for his kid's sake, his love was so great for him, that he would do
anything to save his life. Audiences could relate to that, and that
cleverly became the focal and selling point of the film. That is
primarily why this film won an Oscar for best foreign film, its comedy
alone would not have been enough.</P>
<P>The film, to its ever lasting credit, was able to clearly depict Jews as
human beings, not as objects to be reduced to soap or buttons, more
human than the Nazis, who have disqualified themselves from being a
civilized regime by their inhumanity.This leaves the masterminds of
racial superiority with their own absurd philosophies of intolerance.</P>
<P>Where I think LIFE IS BEAUTFUL succeeded most, is being a film that
inadvertly, without probably really being fully aware of what it was
doing, showed how unprepared the Jews were for this tragedy by being in
a state of denial. After the Holocaust, the rallying motto of the
surviving Jews was "Never Again." And what they learned from this event
in history, is to be vigilant and not be in a state of denial about
prejudice ever again. Which is one of the reasons why the Holocaust is
such a touchy subject, and one has to be careful about how one presents
it to others, lest one forgets its dire consequences. And as
unbelievable as it may seem, LIFE IS BEAUTFUL, somehow or other, caught
an interesting aspect of the Holocaust, with an original take on how
passive the Jews were, something few films really make a major point of,
for one reason or another. Most Italian Jews stayed put in their home
country until the moment was too late for them to leave, never believing
that the absurd philosophy of the Nazis could be taken seriously. Guido,
at this time, is in the bourgeoisie social strata, being a bookseller,
not wanting to give up on his country; while, at the same time frame,
Primo Levi, was an Italian resistance fighter, captured and sent to the
camp.</P>
<P>Did the film do enough to show the horrors of genocide ? For some people
it evidently did enough to leave them beguiled by the improbable mix of
comedy and a Holocaust. The uniqueness and likability of this film, is
that Benigni exploits his comic talents to take advantage of a very
difficult situation, using comedy as a weapon. But this is most
definetly an example of the rewriting of history, by seeing the
Holocaust as if it could almost be perceived as comical and not quite
real, as a fable, depending on the audience itself to know fully well
what happened, where only by the very end of the film, is there a
realization that something terrible has happened and a tear could be
shed, does a disservice to how history and the victims of it look at it
and fails to recognize how little people not directly involved with the
Holocaust actually know about it.</P>
<P>There is a reason why films are popular, and that reason is that people
want to see what they like on screen, they as a rule, do not like to
think about things that are unpleasant to them, and this film has deftly
and arbitrarily accomplished that by skimming the surface off all the
horrible things they could have seen, instead, it subtly goes about its
business by hiding from the audience what really happened to the Jews in
those camps by not showing how real their plight was.This film seemed
almost like it was primarily a very personal film about a father's love
for his family and his great sacrifice for them, rather than a Holocaust
film per se.</P>
<P>That the world is still filled with hatred, filled with other genocide
campaigns, and not filled with enough people throughout the world with
enough courage to put a stop to this attitude, is as plain as day. I
still think that most of the world is at a low stage of the evolutionary
scale and ready to do a Nazi-style thing all over, if given the chance,
just check out the recent Serbian-Kosovo conflict for affirmation that
ethnic cleansing has not gone away with the end of Nazism.</P>
<P>So what can a film do ? Probably, all it can do is show what really
happened, and it doesn't matter if its method is drama, comedy, or even
a musical, as long as it is meaningful. I intend to be very critically
tolerant of this film and say, that even though it struck me as a rather
thin Holocaust story, it is still a worthwhile film for those who don't
want or can't handle the heavier stuff, and are not put off by the
comedy. They will find, if they look hard enough and look past what
Miramax promoted for its own purposes so it could win the Oscar, a film
that is more complex than it appears at first glance. But they will also
find, that it is a film that still makes it evident, that the world
still is in denial of what really happened, and can only look at the
Holocaust in a rather superficial way, even after all these years. There
is still an element of world guilt, that because of that, will so highly
reward this film with honors, even if the film has shown that it cannot
open up both its eyes to see how real the Holocaust was. But, I guess,
we should thank Benigni for at least opening up one eye, and letting us
see that both his film's take on the Holocaust and most of the world's
take on the Holocaust, is still bonded by denial about how they view the
Holocaust, which is the same mistake the Italian Jews made when they
denied the obvious, what was right in front of their noses, until it was
too late.</P>
