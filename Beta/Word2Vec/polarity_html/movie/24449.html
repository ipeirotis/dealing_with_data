<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It's rare that a woman directs a noir film and especially one as
hard-boiled as this one appears to be. Maggie Greenwald (The Ballad of
Little Jo), in the tradition of Ida Lupino, directs this independent
low-budget modern noir film by using dark shades of technicolor as her
auteur signature. She paints a downtrodden East Coast resort town with
the broad brushstrokes of losers and casts her camera on them as they
interact with each other out of desperation. The film decides to go
without a main protagonist, but tells the story of what's eating away at
all these citizens, enough for murder to result. It is based on a book
by the late pulp novelist Jim Thompson, whose Grifters was successfully
made into a film. The theme of the film could easily be: 'misery loves
company.'</P>
<P>Luanne (Gross) is the middle-aged town gossip, the most detested person
in town, who has an acid-tongue and is not adverse to dropping
bombshells on any of the town's citizens. She is a pitiful woman, who
remains bedridden. Her doctor refuses to treat her anymore, saying there
is nothing wrong with her. She married when she was 35-years-old a much
younger man, the 18-year-old Ralph (Monroe), who is a dimwit. He stays
with her because she manages his life and lets him fool around with
other women as long as he tells her about it. He works as a handyman for
one of the resort places and as a janitor in the Pavillion bar.</P>
<P>Ms. Greenwald's penchant for long close-ups of her disgruntled players,
creates a noir feel for the film. She also adds strength to the noir
style of the film, by having the dialogue stripped to the bare minimum.
The movie opens with the abrasive Luanne on the phone spreading the dirt
about the middle-aged Lily Williams (Kelly), who has lived alone with
her brother for a number of years, and now is pregnant by him. Luanne
claims that what she says is always true and that she does it because
the town treated her so badly when she married Ralph, that she is only
giving them a dose of their own medicine. Lily commits suicide, since
she was unable to stop Luanne from talking to others on the phone about
her and apparently couldn't face the music for her actions.</P>
<P>The film's downbeat mood reflects the characters and their dismal lives.
The bar owner, Pete (Jackson Sims), wonders why there is no one in his
bar when it was once a hot spot. His bartender, the disconsolate Rags
(Russell), who came to this town after his family died in an accidental
fire, which he set when he was drunk (which is information only Luanne
knows about), advices Pete to get girl strippers in the place to draw in
the off-season crowd. Pete will find a prostitute in the street, Danny
Lee (Haase), and make her the club's stripper. She lacks the confidence
to believe that she will be able to do a good job as a stripper.</P>
<P>Pete's other pressing problem is his daughter Myra (Fox), who is seeing
on the sly Dr. Ashton's good-for-nothing son, Bobby (Barrett). He is
giving her heroin and as learnt through Luanne's gossip, has also been
dealing hard-drugs in his bar.</P>
<P>Pete is also fretting about the deal he had with Luanne's father, where
he lent him ten thousand dollars for a business venture and that money
was never repaid to him when he died. Pete is sure that Luanne socked
the money away.</P>
<P>Luanne tells Pete that she knows he raped his daughter, which Pete says
only happened once, when he was drunk and didn't know what he was doing.
She tells him that he should be grateful she has kept her mouth shut and
the money she has taken from him, should be considered as a payment for
her silence.</P>
<P>Bobby, to spite Luanne, gets Ralph fired from his handyman job, which
causes Ralph to go into a panic that he won't have enough money to live
in this small-town and he wails that he does not feel secure enough to
live anywhere else. His panic continues even after Luanne tells him not
to worry, that she has some money saved to support them.</P>
<P>Ralph falls in love with Danny, as he watches her strip show and tries
to build her confidence by admiring her act. Luanne sensing that Ralph
has found another woman, gets Bobby on her side, by offering him a lot
of money to take care of the stripper. But Bobby can't go through with
it. In the meantime, Danny plots with Ralph, telling him that he should
kill Luanne and that afterwards they should get married.</P>
<P>The film comes to its climax as Luanne is murdered. In the book, the
author never revealed who did it. Ms. Greenwald, instead, lets the
viewer see who killed Luanne. She aims to show all the desultory
characters and how their hatred motivates what they do in life, in lieu,
of going for the suspense.</P>
<P>The film failed to be a nail-biter and it wasn't psychologically deep,
nor was it morally arresting, but what it had going for it in spades,
was showing a feeling of malaise. The film caught the essence of these
wasted souls and gave them their 15- minutes of fame. A very competently
made film, if you are willing to be taken down such dark stairs, where
the light is very dim and the view is not that great and what becomes
rewarding, is seeing how transfixed the characters are as they cannot
change their ways, even if they come to realize that their life depends
on positive changes occurring.</P>
