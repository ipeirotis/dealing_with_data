<P>     BURNT BY THE SUN, the winner of 1995's Best Foreign Film Oscar, 
attempts, with only limited success, to combine two segments of 
radically different pacing and temperament.  The movie's resolution 
represents forty-five minutes of taut, arresting drama.  The setup, 
which weighs in at an overlong ninety minutes, has a tendency to 
meander.  The overall effect is to limit the impact of the picture, 
primarily because half the audience may be asleep by the time the climax 
arrives.  </P>
<P>     The film takes place in 1936 Russia, nineteen years after the 
Communist Revolution and well into Stalin's reign of terror.  We are 
introduced to Colonel Serguei Kotov (Nikita Mikhalkov), hero of the 
Revolution, and his family:  young wife Maroussia (Ingeborga 
Dapkounaite) and six-year old daughter Nadia (Nadia Mikhalkov).  They 
are spending a happy, peaceful summer at a rural retreat.  Into this 
idyllic setting comes Dimitri (Oleg Menchikov), an old lover of 
Moroussia's who was once in exile and whose current occupation is 
unknown.  His appearance irrevocably alters the loving relationship 
between Kotov and his wife as secrets, both new and old, come to light, 
and buried jealousy bubbles to the surface. </P>
<P>     Director Nikita Mikhalkov is up front about the ultimate meaning of 
his film, dedicating it to "everyone who was burnt by the sun of the 
Revolution."  This movie is very much an attack on the policies and 
paranoia of Stalin.  The chilling final scenes emphasize the theme as we 
come to realize just how far-reaching the dictator's grasp was, and how 
insecure even the most loyal patriots were. </P>
<P>     BURNT BY THE SUN's most apparent flaw is the stagnancy of its first 
two-thirds, which are scripted like Checkov in slow-motion, but without 
depth.  Other than establishing relationships and hinting at past 
misdeeds, this portion of the film serves little purpose beyond 
presenting impressive views of Russian country vistas and highlighting 
several fine performances.  Directors like the legendary Ingmar Bergman 
embraced this sort of deliberate, unhurried pace, but Bergman's films 
always had multiple levels of meaning.  Mikhalkov's pastoral sequences 
are distressingly shallow -- they give us the characters and their 
relationships, but little more.  Only in the final third does the plot 
begin to explore issues of substance and power.   </P>
<P>     Symbolism plays a key part in BURNT BY THE SUN.  Some of it, like a 
huge, billowing portrait of Stalin, is obvious, but much is obscure.  
It's left up to the individual viewer to determine how literally to take 
several instances of magic realism -- not that a particular 
interpretation will more than subtly change anyone's appreciation of the 
film.  Mikhalkov makes sure that his principal thesis is conveyed in 
such a manner that it's impossible to overlook or misunderstand. </P>
<P>     BURNT BY THE SUN is characterized by solid acting (including a 
performance by director Mikhalkov as Kotov), but the real standout is 
the film maker's daughter Nadia, who displays a wonderfully wide-eyed 
energy and unexpected aptitude for dialogue.  At the tender age of six, 
the young actress gives an amazingly unforced portrayal.  </P>
<P>     This is the first anti-Stalin film to come out of post-Communist 
Russia, and the new freedom shows in the full scope of what Mikhalkov is 
able to criticize.  This story is the latest to illustrate the age-old 
injustices inherent in absolute power and how easily past loyalties are 
betrayed.  After the protracted and sluggish setup, the meat of BURNT BY 
THE SUN is as gripping as that of any "serious" motion picture -- it's 
getting to that point that's the main difficulty. </P>
