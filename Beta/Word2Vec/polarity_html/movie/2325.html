<PRE>                              HEAVEN AND EARTH
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Hiep Thi Le, Tommy Lee Jones, Joan Chen, Haing S. Ngor.
Screenplay/Director:  Oliver Stone.</P>
<P>     The problem with Oliver Stone, in my humble opinion, has always
been that he just doesn't know when to shut up.  I have long been a
detractor of Stone's, but that opinion hasn't been a result of his
visual style; each of his films can boast at least one moment of real
flair.  Unfortunately, Stone's tendency towards the pedantic often
obscures those elements of his films which do work.  HEAVEN AND EARTH,
Stone's third foray into the Vietnam War, is much the same.  Every once
in a while, when he lets his camera do the talking, you can see the
potential for greatness, but the talky, over-narrated script blunts the
film's power.</P>
<P>     HEAVEN AND EARTH spans thirty years in the life of Le Ly (Hiep Thi
Le), a Vietnamese farm girl from the small village of Ky La.  She grows
up during the French occupation, then watches as the Viet Cong begins
to win the support of the people, including two of her brothers.  The
fighting is encouraged by Le Ly's fiery Mama (Joan Chen), but meets
with the disapproval of introspective Papa (Haing S. Ngor).  Conflicts
with both the V.C. and the South Vietnamese government soon force Le Ly
and her mother into Saigon, where different hardships await.  She
finally seems to find happiness with an American Marine (Tommy Lee
Jones), but as she begins life in America she discovers that for
herself and many others, the war is still not over.</P>
<P>     Visually, there are several sequences worthy of an Oliver Stone
highlight reel.  Cinematographer Robert Richardson's opening shots of
Ky La are rich and beautiful, including a particularly striking image
of an orange-robed Buddhist monk walking through tall green grass.
There is an intense sequence involving Le Ly's torture at the hands of
the Southern government which had the entire audience gasping and
squirming.  Perhaps most notable is the whimsical portrayal of Le Ly's
first encounters with American consumer culture, including a
slow-motion walk to an overstuffed refrigerator and the preparation of
a dinner entirely from frozen and canned foods.  Stone has a keen
directorial eye, and HEAVEN AND EARTH is usually interesting to watch.</P>
<P>     Would that Stone's ear were so keen.  HEAVEN AND EARTH's primary
responsibility is to pull the viewer into Le Ly's suffering, but that
never really happened for me.  The main reason for this failure is
Stone's decision to use--and over-use--narration by Le Ly.  There is
very little in the narration which could not have been demonstrated
visually, and it acts as a distancing mechanism, providing a
retrospective voice which doesn't allow the trials of a teenage girl to
seem like they're happening to a teenage girl.  It's sloppy
screenwriting on Stone's part, and all the more disappointing because
he's so much better at showing than he is at telling.  Where we should
be focusing on harrowing images, instead we get speeches.</P>
<P>     Newcomer Hiep Thi Le has to carry the two and a half hour film,
and essentially she's up to the task.  As with most novices, her
biggest problems are with scenes requiring big emotions, but those
problems are not distracting.  Le displays Le Ly's strength and
determination admirably, as well as her conviction that karma from a
past life is responsible for her current troubles.  Joan Chen is
extremely effective as Le Ly's mother, and Haing S. Ngor turns in his
second strong performance of the year (after MY LIFE) as Papa.
Conchata Ferrell is also notable in a scene-stealing turn as Le Ly's
gabby American sister-in-law.  However, the one disappointing
supporting performance is turned in by Tommy Lee Jones.  His Sgt.
Butler is only sketchily developed, appearing late in the film and
never developing fully enough to make his later actions
understandable.  Still, Stone is a fine director of actors, and his
cast is basically strong.</P>
<P>     Stone's intention with HEAVEN AND EARTH was clearly to show us
that as much as we in America think we suffered as a result of the
Vietnam War, Vietnam suffered more.  There are glimpses of that
suffering, but it should have been a much easier point to bring
across.  Le Ly experiences more suffering than most lifetimes, but it
never seemed quite real.  Elements of HEAVEN AND EARTH carry undeniable
impact, but when it was money time he should have descended from his
soapbox and let his camera do the talking.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 years of war:  6.</PRE>
