ROMANCE (director/writer: Catherine Breillat; cinematographer: Yorgos
Arvanitis; editor: Agnes Guillemot; cast: Caroline Ducey (Marie),
Sagamore Stevenin (Paul), Francois Berleand (Robert), Rocco Siffredi
(Paolo), 1999)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Catherine Breillat (36 Fillette/Perfect Love!) has made a sexually
graphic French film showing a woman's needs in a relationship. Her
seventh feature film has become her only European box office success,
though it has not received the same response in America. It is told from
the point of view of the slender, well-dressed, and attractive
elementary-school teacher, Marie (Ducey), who is married to the handsome
male model, Paul (Stevenin), in what has become a self-destructive
relationship for her. She loves him very much and early on in their
relationship there was much passion, but there is one major problem for
Marie now: Paul hasn't made love to her for months. We watch them in bed
in their modern but sterile all-white apartment and see that he has lost
interest in her even though she is dying to be made love to.</P>
<P>The film wavers between being a philosophical treatise on women and
being about a woman's passions without resolving what any contemporary
woman's magazine currently does (this unresolvement can be seen in both
a positive and a negative sense). The effort here is to push the film
along shock value lines, of pushing it more into the lines of what a
porno film does as routine. What the film does very well, even if it
kills any dramatic spirit there might have been in the film, is that it
voices the private sexual fantasy thoughts of Marie and peeks into her
head as she thinks to herself what she wants a guy to do to her sexually
and what attracts her about a man. Some of her revelations might
surprise the opposite sex, as this film is helpful like a self-help book
is meant to be.</P>
<P>After a distasteful night of sexual frustration, Marie leaves Paul in
bed and heads for the nearest bar, where she meets an actual Italian
porno star Rocco Siffredi. He is Paolo in the movie, whose girlfriend
died in an auto accident and is more than willing to f*ck Marie any way
she wants to. Because of the enormous size of his penis, he pleases one
part of her greatly. She makes no bones about it that she loves the
carnal act. She confides that kissing is intimate and means more to her
than the sex act, since she doesn't care who "stuffs her below." She
only ends this one-night stand when she begins to feel that she is
starting to like Paolo as a person.</P>
<P>At work, she strikes up a relationship with an older, obese, ugly man,
Robert (Berleand). He is the principal of her school and when he takes
her to his bachelor pad designed to attract a wide-assortment of women,
as it is fit with a Jacuzzi as well as bondage equipment, and the
apartment is sensually colored in dark bordello hues of reds. He tells
her he is a great lover, having made love to over 10,000 women, despite
not being rich, handsome, well-built, young, or a celebrity. He tells
her that what he has going for him, is that he knows how to please a
woman sexually and how to listen to her. He tells her that even though
women want to be respected, they want to be taken by a man who desires
them and a stranger usually gets to her first, as a friend is too polite
to act on his impulses. Marie's best comment to this is, "Why do men who
disgust us, understand us best." A sadomasochistic relationship
develops, with limits being established, as she gets off while he ties
her up and gags her. She seems to enjoy this perverse relationship, of
being degraded, better than all her others, as we see her with Robert in
this situation twice.</P>
<P>There are some more sexual fantasies for her: of masturbating with her
legs closed to prove that she doesn't need a man to enjoy herself, and
of meeting with a vulgar stranger who wants to give her $20 just to
taste her vagina, who when she accepts the offer then takes her by force
from behind. A group of gynecologists "invade" her vagina, which allows
her to freely fantasize about this experience. She goes to them after
getting pregnant by Paul, who realizes that she is slipping away from
him and thereby awkwardly makes love to her while she sits atop of him.
She considers it ironical that she makes love to him when she is
cheating on him and that when she was faithful to him he ignored her.
She also has a weird dream of a guillotine-like contraption without
blades dangling over some women's legs. The film ends on a reassuring
note for those who take a more traditional view on what a woman is, as
Ducey says, "They say a woman isn't a woman until she's a mother; it's
true."</P>
<P>Despite the film's coldness, lack of humor, bleak conceptions about
relationships, unappetizing sexual scenes, lack of dramatic tension, and
pretentious philosophizing by Caroline Ducey, it still had something
disturbing to say about relationships that was worth listening to. For
the director, sex is shown to be what fantasies are made of: that it is
all in one's head. To show this, Breillat her heroine be nude for many
scenes and therefore symbolically stripped her of all the illusions she
has about sex, as we watch her act out these fantasies. Though the film
might not always be appealing, it is still not a work of trash; it does
have something to say of what goes on in the marital bedroom. How much
you like what it says might depend on what you thought it was digging at
and if its romantic notions rang a bell in your head. My thoughts are
that the film's presentation didn't particularly excite me, but
afterwards it left me thinking about what it had to say about
relationships, which are still just as great a mystery as God is, and I
began to warm to the film more than while I was watching it. It,
somehow, made me think more about the dark side of a relationship and
for that reason alone, I wouldn't entirely dismiss this film, though I
wonder at what it really was trying to get at.</P>
<P>The body of the film's works is quite different than its ending, which
shows Ducey giving birth to a son and her womanhood supposedly being
fulfilled. Robert is at her bedside as her drunken husband remains in
the apartment, where she opened all the gas jets in the kitchen to cause
an explosion, which kills him.</P>
<P>Breillat is trying to provoke the male viewer to think further about
what a woman craves for in a relationship and calling out for a woman to
seriously think about what she wants in a man and what she is capable of
doing in a relationship. I think this is a film women might be more
appreciative than men.</P>
