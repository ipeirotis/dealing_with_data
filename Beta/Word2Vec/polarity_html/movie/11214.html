<PRE>Picture Perfect</PRE>
<PRE>Summary </PRE>
<P>Kate (Jennifer Aniston) is having some problems. It appears the
twenty-eight year old is not happy with her slow progression up the
company ladder, and her love life apparently leaves something to be
desired. She learns that her problems are related, as the owner of her
advertising agency, Mr. Mercer (Kevin Dunn), explains to her that her
single status does not bode well with the company. Her freedom would
make her more likely to leave the company, taking clients with her.</P>
<P>    A solution presents itself in Nick (Jay Mohr), a wedding
videographer who Kate meets through a coincidence and gets
photographed with. Kate's boss, Darcy (Illeana Douglas), uses the
photograph to fabricate a wedding engagement between Kate and
Nick. Kate is at first repulsed by the idea, but after getting
immediate positive results, she pursues it.</P>
<P>    Her first task is to convince Nick to go along with her plan. The
actual plan consists of Nick pretending to be her fiancé. At a
dinner with Kate's bosses he will provoke a fight and they will break
up. She meets Nick to propose the plan. He accepts.</P>
<P>    Kate's new status brings unexpected results in other areas. The
office bad boy, Sam (Kevin Bacon), who wouldn't give Kate the time of
day, now does. Now that she is engaged, he pursues an affair with her,
as doing so would destroy her good girl image, hence Sam's sudden
interest.</P>
<P>    Things start to fall apart for Kate, as it becomes apparent that
Nick really likes her, and does not wish to break up with her. After
some provoking Nick does oblige, but problems continue for Kate. It
appears Sam is no longer interested now that she is available. Or
maybe Kate does like Nick, but "reconciliation" will force her to
admit her lies to her employer. Adding to her mess is the constant
prying of her mother (Olympia Dukakis), who wants her to get married
and settle down.</P>
<PRE>Commentary</PRE>
<P>    There is a scene in this movie where Jennifer Aniston is (from the
waist up) only wearing a bra. It made me chuckle because it is the
only time in the movie when she actually wears one. There is enough
cleavage in this movie to satisfy Russ Meyer. It's like the director
said 'Well, we know the story is formulaic and the performances aren't
that great so, what the heck, let's show Jennifer's assets as often
and as uncovered as humanly possible to keep the PG rating."  Quite
frankly it's insulting.</P>
<P>    I don't think Aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a
movie. She did a decent enough job in Ed Burns' "She's the One"
because it was a smaller and supporting role, and she just doesn't
deliver the goods effectively in this movie. Her performance was not
convincing.</P>
<P>    Unfortunately, as far as romantic comedies go, this movie adds
nothing new to the standard formula for these types of movies. The
film is similar to "My Best Friends Wedding" in a sense that the
leading female character is actually quite vindictive and due her
actions, gets no sympathy from me when things go awry. I didn't care
for how quickly Kate puts down Nick's profession by explaining that
videotaping weddings wasn't glamorous enough for her co-workers.
 At least "My  Best Friends Wedding" changed the formula a bit and had a
somewhat surprise ending. No such luck with "Picture Perfect". </P>
<P>    Every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away, including a
couple that really made no sense. After everything Kate had done to
prove her loyalty to her company, why would she blindly throw it all
away when she should have made sure that Nick would even talk to her
first, let alone consider a relationship? Was quitting her job a
prerequisite to making amends with Nick? Throw in the fact that I
don't think Nick and Kate spent enough time together to even warrant
that rash of a decision. I believe that Kate liked him, but liked him
so intensely that she was willing to throw her career away? I doubt
it. And what of the ending scene at a wedding where the entire
congregation feels it necessary to stop everything and stare at the
couple? Are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in
total strangers? Well, I guess of the congregation consists of movie
extras and the strangers are the movies two lead stars, then that
would make sense.</P>
