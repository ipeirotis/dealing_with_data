CASABLANCA
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>There are some works of art that are almost impossible to
review, not because of their own complexity, but because of
their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say
anything original. One of such masterpieces is CASABLANCA,
probably not the best film in the history of the seventh
art, but definitely the most popular one. Its popularity can
be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised
remakes that were made in more than half a century since its
premiere, but also in countless tributes and references that
movie makers use in their works to this day. CASABLANCA is
also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being
praised by the critics and loved by general audience.</P>
<P>One of the things that makes this film even more unique was
the fact that it was doomed to fail, at least judging by
conventional movie-making wisdom of its time. It was based
on a Broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced
on stage; screenplay by three writers - Julius G. Epstein,
Philip J. Epstein and Howard Koch - was beeing written as
shooting went along; the main actors were producers' second
choice, and, finally, man behind camera, Michael Curtiz was
considered to be capable, but not great director. However,
the movie was commercially successful and earned three
"Oscars", including the one for the best film. Until this
very day, it is considered to be the best example of
Hollywood film- making in its own Golden Age.</P>
<P>The plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of
WW2 propaganda, yet it also used rather complicated and now
almost forgotten political circumstances of that global
conflict in order to make intriguing story. In December
1941, Casablanca, exotic port on the Atlantic coast of North
Africa is controlled by officially neutral, yet
Nazi-collaborating French Vichy government. Thousands of
refugees from war-torn Europe are stuck there on the way to
Lisbon and safety of America, and ready to pay any price for
precious exit visas. Many shady characters thrive on their
misery, including the corrupt police chief, Captain Renault
(Rains). His best friend is Rick Blaine (Bogart), who used
to be idealistic anti-Fascist, and now owns popular night
club in Casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy
of "sticking his neck for nobody". However, everything
changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra
visas. This event coincides with the arrival of two new
refugees to Casablanca. One of them is Victor Laszlo
(Henreid), Czech resistance leader who escaped three times
from Nazi concentration camps and became the legend of
enslaved Europe. He is accompanied by his beautiful wife
Ilsa Lund (Bergman), with whom Rick had a stormy affair in
the eve of Nazi occupation of Paris. The couple needs visas,
especially because of the Gestapo Major Strasser (Veidt)
being on their trail. Rick is now forced to choose between
love, wounded pride, self-preserving interest and his own
hatred of Fascism.</P>
<P>The casting for this movie seems influenced by divine
inspiration - Humphrey Bogart, most legendary actor in the
history of cinema, is one of the rare character actors who
elevated his persona to the star status. Bogart's portrayal
of Rick as complicated man, torn between idealistic past and
bitter present, was so perfect, that his icon would forever
be connected with that character. Another icon in his
company is Ingrid Bergman, great actress of Old Hollywood,
here in her artistic and visual prime. The cinematic
coupling of Bogart and Bergman became one of the main
symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when
the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite
like in some more contemporary works. For many people,
CASABLANCA is probably the best romantic film ever made. But
the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the
realistic story of people forced to make tough, and often
wrong choices in their life.</P>
<P>The casting of CASABLANCA was right on target not just in a
case of main leads. The supporting actors also did a
marvellous job. Sidney Longstreet and Peter Lorre were here
mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous Bogart
classic - John Huston's MALTESE FALCON; yet both of them
managed to portray colourful and original characters.
Another shining example of good casting is now almost
forgotten Paul Henreid as the weakest part of love triangle;
character of Victor Laszlo has believable charisma and looks
like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise
against Nazi tiranny. Unfortunately, the charisma that
burdened Laszlo, leaves little place for difficult choice,
making his character forever overshadowed by Rick/Ilsa
coupling.</P>
<P>However, Rick and Ilsa actually have a serious competiton
for most memorable character in CASABLANCA. Captain Renault,
brilliantly portrayed by Claude Rains in a role of a
lifetime, was embodiment of perfect, almost unmatched
balance between ethical corruption and physical charm.
Despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie,
Rains managed to make Renault sympathetic character, and his
final conversion to the side of Good, symbolized in not so
subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary. Rains
also gave another dimension to the movie, making it even
more ambiguous; people who like to analyse movies to death
discovered signs of homosexuality in Renault's relationship
towards Rick, and Rick's final words leave room for even
more outrageous speculations.</P>
<P>Together with well-drawn characters and exciting story, the
movie was good in creating his own atmosphere. Professional
nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering
numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies, but
CASABLANCA is still a shining example of Hollywood WW2 movie
that is beliavable, if not realistic. Any way, even if we
don't see it as a historical document, CASABLANCA is movie
that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite
inspiration.</P>
