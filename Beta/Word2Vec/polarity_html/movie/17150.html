<P>SCENIC ROUTE, THE (director: Mark Rappaport; cast: Randy Danson
(Estelle),  Marilyn Jones (Lena), Kevin Wade (Paul), Grant Stewart
(Jack), Arthur Ginsberg (A Stalker),  1978)</P>
<P>We need myths to live by, says the heroine of this film, Estelle (Randy
Danson). And somehow Rappaport concocts a mythic love tale around this
premise, that is similar in some aspects to the Orpheus and Eurydice
myth, whereas Orpheus rescued his love from Hades, but even though he
was told by the gods not to look back or she would disappear, he did
look back because of his insecurities and fear that Eurydice would think
that he didn't care for her anymore.</P>
<P>The estranged relationship of the sisters, Estelle and Lena (Jones), is
somewhat reconciled as they start living together after a long absence
from one another, mainly, because Estelle feels guilty about how she
treated her sister before. So she lets her live with her, even though
she would rather not have her there. Soon they find themselves in the
delicate position of having gone out with the same man, an extremely
muted man, Paul (Kevin), who forms a relationship with each of the
sisters, first with Estelle and then by coincidence, he meets Lena, but
fails to fulfill his fantasy of having a sexual relationship with both
of them at the same time.</P>
<P>This film is distinguished by its stylish use of opera, classical
painting, and Victorian soap opera like-dramatics, to get across its
strange wit and Rilkean-like observations of what can be seen from life
when you become a passive observer of it. The observer is Estelle, who
pictures herself as if she was the one she is seeing when she looks out
at a world she feels imprisoned by.</P>
<P>It could be a very witty movie if you are receptive to the characters'
personality foibles, as they mock or imitate what the real-life troubled
modern heterosexuals in NYC are up to, as Paul acts out the part at
being the tall dark, silent type of macho he-man, who is animalistic in
his attraction to both sisters: Estelle, with her pretentious romantic
soul, who is endowed with beautiful breasts; and her more down to earth
sister, who is not the romantic type, but is more prosaic in her outlook
toward life, who is attractive but suffers from psychological problems
and fits of violence.</P>
<P>Violence somehow plays into the motifs of the story, as there is talk of
a serial killer on the loose in the city, which prompts Estelle to say,
"she is afraid to go outside and she is afraid to stay inside." She even
thinks that her ex-husband, Jack (Grant), might be the killer, since he
is prone to acting peculiarly hostile at times. But the killer is
caught, and it is not Jack.</P>
<P>Everyone in the film is a take-off of what a real person might be like
when they are going through a relationship or when encountering
strangers in public places. As for the later, Lena confronts a stalker
by coming on strong to him, thusly chasing him away, as he absurdly
tells her he should get the cops on her. Everyone is meant to be a
cartoon character, ones' whom you can poke fun at, especially when they
take themselves seriously.</P>
<P>Estelle provides the voice-over, which underscores the striking visual
scenery in the background, like the starry sky wallpaper in her room
that she is most comfortable with, as she collects her thoughts from the
diary she is writing, mixing her keen observations about romance, with
comments such as, men are attracted to women who wear a wedding band,
because it is like a challenge for them to conquer a married woman, to
her consuming jealousy and mistrust of others, even those she once
loved, like Jack, Paul, and Lena.</P>
<P>Estelle becomes a sort of representative of all women who are bitchy,
wrongfully hurt in a relationship, or too consumed in their fantasy
world of what a guy should be like to ever form a lasting relationship.
The film's aim is to be humorous about this. Even the final scene, where
she at lasts burns her diary (similar to the women lib bra burnings) can
be taken both as comic or dramatic theatrics. In any case, this is a
very unusual and original work, that is sometimes slow-going, missing
the mark by being too outrageous and covering far too much ground for
its own good; but, more often than not, it is right on the mark, using
its token males, Paul, as an insignificant stud, a servicer of the
female race, and Jack, as an untrustworthy spouse, perceived as being
capable of violent acts, as the sisters encompass the gamut of womanly
wants in a man, in a most peculiar way.</P>
<P>This film should appeal to urban dwellers who have been in a triangular
heterosexual relationship and came out of it more confused than when
first entering it and to those who have a more tolerant and
sophisticated attitude toward impossible relationships. And as Estelle
so ably says, after her burning ritual, "I need some new myths for my
life, the old ones don't work anymore." This film is a parody of the
Orpheus myth, and as Estelle says, "she gave Paul two chances to get her
out of hell, but he failed both times, Orpheus was given only one
chance."</P>
<P>.... Incidently, the funniest line in the movie is reserved for Paul, who
tells Estelle, "I wouldn't even tell you a lie, much less the truth." I
think that line summarizes what the movie is ultimately about.</P>
