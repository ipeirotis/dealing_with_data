KINGDOM COME
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>In Doug McHenry's KINGDOM COME, the death of a man so unloved by his 
wife (Whoopi Goldberg) that she wants only three words of derision on 
his tombstone ("Mean and Surly") brings together his dysfunctional 
family for the funeral.  In the story's best line, the funeral home 
brags in its advertisements that it's "Your pit stop to the afterlife."  
The script by David Dean Bottrell and Jessie Jones, based on their play 
"Dearly Departed," might well have worked when it was a play, but, as a 
movie, it feels so much like a typical television sitcom that it's a 
wonder that it doesn't have a laugh track.</P>
<P>When we first meet Clarisse (Jada Pinkett Smith) and her unfaithful 
husband, Junior (Anthony Anderson), they are arguing their way down the 
highway.  As she slaps at him, he tries to kill both of them, as well as 
their 3 young kids, by running the car off the road.  Of course, since 
this is a slapstick comedy, the movie doesn't expect us to take any of 
this seriously.</P>
<P>Other members of the family on their way to the funeral include Lucille 
(Vivica A. Fox) and her husband, Ray Budd (LL Cool J), and Marguerite 
(Loretta Devine) and her son, Royce (Darius McCrary).  Royce has big 
ambitions, which pleases his highly religious mother.  He plans on 
having several kids.  She explodes, however, when he explains that he 
wants them only so he can live off welfare.  To show how rotten he is, 
the story has him flaunting his smoking in front of a "No Smoking" sign 
in the room in the funeral home in which the father's body lies in 
repose.     </P>
<P>Cedric the Entertainer plays Reverend Hooker, a cheery preacher with a 
humorously exaggerated lisp.  His predilection for spicy Mexican food 
turns the funeral into a fart fest.</P>
<P>Although harmless enough, the movie is rarely funny.  My personal laugh 
count was zip.  Still, if you're a fan of TV sitcoms, which I'm not, you 
might like KINGDOM COME.  Some very vocal members of my audience 
certainly did.</P>
<P>KINGDOM COME runs 1:35.  It is rated PG for thematic elements, language 
and sensuality and would be acceptable for kids around 8 and up.</P>
