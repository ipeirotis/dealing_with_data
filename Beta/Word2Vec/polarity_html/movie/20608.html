<PRE>MUMFORD
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>Dr. Mumford (Loren Dean) is a psychologist with a difference in MUMFORD,
the latest cinematic treasure from writer/director Lawrence Kasdan (THE
BIG CHILL and GRAND CANYON).</P>
<P>As an inviting enigma, Dean gives a deceptively seductive performance.
He almost hypnotizes the audience with his smooth, blank slate of a
face.  Dr. Mumford, a world-class listener, possesses such subdued charm
that people are compelled to tell him their most hidden secrets,
something it's obvious the doc must have a few of himself.</P>
<P>In town for less than 5 months, he's already got more patients than the
other two local shrinks combined.  Ridiculed by one of the town's
sophisticates as "Mayberry, RFD," the place where the doctor has moved
has (coincidentally?) been called Mumford since 1813.</P>
<P>Dr. Mumford listens stoically to some patients but cuts others' time
short if he thinks they're wasting his time.  In a story that isn't in
any hurry to get anywhere, the movie charms with its cornucopia of
well-written and superlatively acted characters.  One of the film's
delights is that you haven't any idea where it is headed.  Its one
mystery is fairly obvious.  Full of wry humor that produces a host of
small laughs and constant grins, the script is perhaps its biggest star.
("The only problem I had with degenerate, self-destructive behavior is
that I couldn't get enough of it.")</P>
<P>>From bars to hardware stores, people pull Dr. Mumford over to seek out
his advice and to bare their souls.  The movie has an almost magical
aspect to it that you can't quite put your finger on.  Lit by
cinematographer Ericson Core to look like a Norman Rockwell painting,
the town of Mumford manages to look appealing even though it conceals a
hotbed of neuroses.</P>
<P>One of his patients is a waif, who has an unhealthy addiction to glamour
magazines.  Lying on his coach, cuddling Bazaar and Elle in her arms,
she confesses, "I want to live in the world that these people are in."</P>
<P>Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis), his prize patient, suffers from Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome.  Davis gives a convincing performance as someone so
tired that she can barely move.  With pale, translucent skin, she
appears so fragile that her bones might be in danger of disintegration.
"You may lie down," the doctor advises her on her first visit to his
office.  "Most people do."  "I'd better not," she replies as if
exhausted by speaking.  "I'd fall right asleep.  Besides, it's probably
too early for me to start sleeping with you."</P>
<P>As obsessive shopper Althea Brockett, Mary McDonnell (DANCES WITH
WOLVES) plays a woman who never met a catalog she didn't love.
Especially fond of two-named stores (Williams-Sonoma, Neiman Marcus,
....), she has closets overflowing with the loot that she's bought but
hasn't unboxed.  Her husband (Ted Danson) is an investment banker who
enjoys the high life.  "No one ever said on his death bed, 'I treated
myself too well,'" he explains to Dr. Mumford, as he blows the smoke
from his large, hotdog-sized cigar into a brandy stifter big enough for
a small aquarium.</P>
<P>The town's Rock of Gibraltar, Lily (Alfre Woodard), owns the local
coffee shop and rents a room to Dr. Mumford.  She spends her evenings
watching television shows like "20/20."  ("It's shocking!" she tells the
doctor about the latest investigative report on 20/20.  "The government
is wasteful.  You heard it here first.")</P>
<P>In a likable and wonderfully naive turn, Jason Lee (CHASING AMY) is Skip
Skiperton, the town's young success story, as the founder of Panda
Modems.  Skip's a lonely guy with a serious case of insecurity for a
multibillionaire.  He complains that his company makes "23% of the
world's modems, but I can't connect with women."  He pays the doc to
play ball with him, while he discusses his many anxieties.</P>
<P>In a movie filled with gems, it's hard to pick out a favorite.  The most
unusual, however, is the telling of his dreams by the pharmacist (Pruitt
Taylor Vince).  He dreams in black and white and his characters are
lifted straight out of old dime store paperbacks - the types populated
with women with large bosoms and grease-monkey men.  Just the sort that
a kid might sneak off to a shed to read, lest he be caught by his
parents and the sort that might forever be trapped in an adult's
subconscious.</P>
<P>MUMFORD runs a fast 1:36.  It is rated R for sex-related images,
language and drug content.  It is a good-spirited film that would be
fine for teenagers.</P>
