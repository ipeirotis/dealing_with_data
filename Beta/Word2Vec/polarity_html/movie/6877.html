<P>     Like most television performers venturing into feature films, Fran
Drescher chose a first starring vehicle which would be comfortable in its
familiarity.  THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST finds Drescher, TV's "The 
Nanny," playing...well, a nanny.  Not much of a stretch, it would seem,
until you take into account the fact that Drescher isn't just playing a
nanny in this case -- she's stepping into the shoes of the quintessential
representation of screen nanny-dom, Julie Andrews.  You see, THE
BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST may be part variation on "Beauty and the Beast"
and part variation on the old "fish-out-of-water" comedy, but at its core
it is something else.  THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST is really THE SOUND OF
MUSIC remade, with a nasal New Yawka instead of a novitiate.</P>
<P>     That may not sound terribly appealing, and indeed the extent to which
you will enjoy THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST may depend on how much of
Drescher you can take in one sitting.  She plays Joy Miller, a New York
beautician teaching night school and living with her parents (Michael
Lerner and Phyllis Newman) while she waits for the perfect job and the
perfect man to come along.  She has a chance for both when she ends up on
the front page of the New York Post for saving several lab animals from a
classroom fire, and that headline brings her to the attention of Boris
Pochenko (Timothy Dalton), the despotic "president" of the tiny Eastern
European nation of Slovetzia.  Pochenko wants his children to be prepared
for the New World Order, and believes they need a Western teacher for that
to happen.  Unfortunately, Pochenko believes Joy is an actual
schoolteacher, a misconception Joy is in no hurry to dispel along with the 
$40,000 a year she is receiving.</P>
<P>     THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST is a slight, meandering little film
which is hard to get a handle on.  Todd Graff's script goes most of the
expected places, creating conflict between the controlling Boris and the
uncontrollable Joy and providing stock characters like a good advisor (Ian
McNeice) to take Joy's side and a bad advisor (Patrick Malahide) to make
the soon-to-be-reformed Boris look better by comparison.  He also tosses
in obscure references (how many audience members are going to remember
NORMA RAE?) and scatters his multiple sub-plots all over the pace to be
picked up whenever time permits.  The plot drifts from Joy's street-wise
counsel to each of Boris's children to preparations for the arrival of
potential foreign investors, never really lingering anywhere long enough
for the events to be of anything but casual interest.  Director Ken Kwapis
doesn't develop any kind of comic rhythm in BEAUTICIAN, allowing many of
the thin gags to stand alone.  He and Graff know how the film is supposed
to begin and how it is supposed to end; it is the vast middle which
provides the problem as they search for some kind of structure in which to
place their characters.</P>
<P>     I suppose one alternative to creating a structure is swiping one,
hence the extended riff on THE SOUND OF MUSIC.  The similarities could
almost be represented by one of those tables with the two films as the
headings.  In THE SOUND OF MUSIC, Maria leaves the Mother Superior in
search of something wonderful; in BEAUTICIAN, Joy leaves her superior
mother.  In THE SOUND OF MUSIC, Maria goes to work for a domineering
military man and takes responsibility for his brood of children; ditto in
BEAUTICIAN.  In THE SOUND OF MUSIC, eldest daughter Liesl has a
surreptitious romance with a young man whose politics clash with those of
her father; eldest daughter Katrina (Lisa Jakub) has the same problem in
BEAUTICIAN.  By the time Boris and Joy realize their love for one another
while dancing at a grand party (sound familiar?), I would not have been
surprised to hear Timothy Dalton break into a chorus of "Edelweiss"</P>
<P>     At least THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST ends where THE SOUND OF MUSIC
should have ended, with the kiss before all the political upheaval.  The
romance in the film is actually fairly appealing, thanks largely to the
entertaining work of Timothy Dalton.  He has a gruff, goofy charm as the
Stalin-esque dictator who grows warm and cuddly, giving spark to Boris'
sudden desire to become a populist even if it doesn't make much sense.  He
also shares a nice chemistry with Drescher whenever she tones down the
attitude for a quieter moment, but quiet is a relative consideration where
Drescher is concerned.  It may seem a bit unfair to knock her for that
grating squeal which can reach dog-whistle pitch when she raises her
voice; after all, it isn't as though she chose it.  There is also no
question that it can be distracting, even if it is her calling card and
gives her an edge many female comics could use more of.  If you can get
past the Drescher Drone, you might be able to ride along on the
feather-light romantic comedy of THE BEAUTICIAN AND THE BEAST.  When the
sound of the leading lady is hardly the sound of music, however, that kind
of enjoyment may not be as simple as do-re-mi.</P>
