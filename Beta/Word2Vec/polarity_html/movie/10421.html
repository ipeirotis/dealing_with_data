<PRE>                           THE PARADINE CASE
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     By now I figured I'd seen every Alfred Hitchcock film at least a
half-dozen times -- not that I'm complaining.  To call him the "Master
of Suspense" is an understatement.  THE PARADINE CASE (1947),
admittedly one of Hitchcock's lesser movies, turned out to be one I'd
missed.  This one, like all Hitchcock films, is well worth savoring.</P>
<P>     The story opens with the rich Mrs. Maddalena Anna Paradine being
arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband.  As Mrs.
Paradine, Alida Valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world.
To Franz Waxman's stark and moody music, we see the prison guards
divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels.  Stripped of her
fine raiment, she becomes a commoner again, which, as it turns out, was
what she was before she met her husband.</P>
<P>     "A brief skirmish, and you'll be lunching at the Savoy again,"
Anthony Keane, her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first
meeting, predicting a fast and easy trial.  Gregory Peck plays the
successful and debonair barrister.</P>
<P>     "She's no murderess," he argues simplistically, smitten by her
beauty.  "She's too fine a woman."  His attitude upsets his beautiful
and increasing jealous wife, Gay (Ann Todd).</P>
<P>     Unlike most Hitchcock movies, which are centered on the thriller
and the mystery, this one is more a romantic melodrama.  Typical is the
scene in which Gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while
bathed in light.  She deflects her husband's affections as she fears
that he is beginning to fall in love with his client.  The dramatic
music then comes up high as the camera dwells on Mrs. Paradine's
portrait nearby.</P>
<P>     In the relatively unsatisfying first half, little happens other
than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires.
To the sound of sweeping violins Gay tells Anthony that he must get
Mrs. Paradine acquitted because, if Mrs. Paradine dies, his heart will
go with her.  If she is freed, he will be able to forget her.</P>
<P>     As part of the soap opera, a mysterious Louis Jordan plays Mr.
Paradine's valet, who has had some not to be discussed relationships.</P>
<P>     Charles Coburn plays Anthony's legal partner, Sir Simon Flaquer.
And Charles Laughton, who looks like Coburn, is Judge Lord Horfield.
This being proper British society, they will all dine together at the
judge's house not long before the case begins.</P>
<P>     Court TV junkies will probably pick up the many differences, some
subtle and others not, between the American and the British judicial
systems.  One, for example, of which I was not aware is that the
barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is
the process of testifying.</P>
<P>     One sometimes wonders what the Academy is thinking when they make
their Oscar nominations.  As the judge's wife, Lady Sophie Horfield,
Ethel Barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress -- the
film's only nomination -- for an inconsequential part with which she
did little of merit.</P>
<P>     (So the big question is when does Hitchcock make his obligatory
walk-on?  At 37 minutes into the film, he leaves a train station
carrying a large musical instrument case.  Don't miss it.)</P>
<P>     In the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into
the courtroom.  The great master shows his hand there as the tensions
build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first.
Watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times
from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial's action.</P>
<P>     As Anthony explains it, the simple case has only 3 possibilities:
Mr. Paradine poisoned himself, Mrs. Paradine did it, or the valet did
it.  The end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists
so it is too bad the first half is so languid.</P>
<P>     THE PARADINE CASE runs 1:53.  The picture is in black and white.
It is not rated but would be PG for mature themes and would be fine for
kids around nine and up if they are interested.</P>
