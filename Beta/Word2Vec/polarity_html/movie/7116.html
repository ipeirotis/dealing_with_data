<P>    Theodore Witcher's LOVE JONES won the Audience Award at the 1997
Sundance Film Festival, which lately seems to be more of a general message
on the state of cinema than a comment on a specific film.  Last year's
winner, THE SPITFIRE GRILL, was a maudlin contraption which was laudable
for being a thoroughly decent redemption story.  In the case of LOVE
JONES, the Audience Award may have been sending a similar message about
what they'd like to see more of.  African-Americans in the movies have
been either clowns, criminals or police captains so often in recent years
that LOVE JONES -- a low-key comedy-drama about educated black artists --
was bound to strike a responsive chord.  I can't help but wonder whether
the Sundance audience was rewarding LOVE JONES itself or the idea of a
film _like_ LOVE JONES.  Make no mistake, Witcher's sophisticated romantic
tale is exceptionally well-crafted and includes some appealing moments,
but the script is sometimes lazy and not particularly interesting.  It's a
film with better intentions than
results.</P>
<P>     LOVE JONES is set in Chicago, where aspiring photographer Nina
Mosley (Nia Long) has just broken up with her fiance.  Nina resolves to
avoid falling in love, but she doesn't count on meeting aspiring poet
Darius Lovehall (Larenz Tate) at a jazz-and-poetry club.  Though Nina
initially resists Darius' advances, she eventually agrees to a date...which
doesn't end until the next morning.  Nina and Darius are soon involved in
a sexual relationship which both parties insist is nothing serious, but
all their friends are skeptical.  The skepticism proves warranted when
Nina's ex-fiance Marvin (Khalil Kain) decides he wants her back, and both
Nina and Darius are unsure how to react.  It is only when each suspects
the other of being unfaithful to their non-exclusive relationship that
they confront what their real feelings might be.</P>
<P>     At its core, LOVE JONES is a spin on WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, a slick
romantic comedy about smart people over-thinking their relationships,
turning those relationships over and over with their friends, and trying
to walk the fine line between friend and lover.  It is fairly incidental
to the story that these characters happen to be African-Americans, yet
that doesn't mean that the film is color-blind, or that the characters
talk like they just walked out of Eton.  The scenes between Darius and his
friends -- Savon (Isaiah Washington), Hollywood (Bill Bellamy) and Sheila
(Bernadette L. Clark) -- have a low-key energy, sparked by the wit of
their ritualized insults.  The dialogue feels natural and authentic, and
the performances are characterized by a convincing sense of familiarity
which makes them even stronger collectively than individually.</P>
<P>     If LOVE JONES had been a film about these characters just sitting
around talking, I probably would have enjoyed it much more.  The problem
is that the plot _is_ essentially a re-hash of WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, with
relationships not nearly as compelling or funny.  Darryl Jones contributes
a wonderfully jazzy score, but that score infuses LOVE JONES with a
languid pace, the effect of which is to make you as nonchalant about the
fate of Darius and Nina's romance as they seem to be themselves.  There is
plenty of chemistry between Larenz Tate and Nia Long; there's just not
enough drama.  The entire arc of their relationship is drawn up in
well-worn tropes:  the meeting in a bar, the reluctant coupling, the
jealously and conflict, even a mad rush by one lover to stop the other
from leaving on a train.  Even when Darius finally breaks down and
confesses his love for Nina, there isn't a sense that there was anything
at stake for these two.  Their relationship seems just fine "just kickin'
it."</P>
<P>     That casual quality sometimes seeps into Witcher's plotting.  Threads
of sub-plots drift through LOVE JONES at regular intervals, and Witcher
never seems interested in explaining them in any detail.  Savon
experiences marital difficulties, but we don't know anything about his
wife and even less about their relationship; Nina has a brief fling with
Hollywood, but we don't know why he seems so deliberately antagonistic
towards Darius.  The large supporting cast consists of faces and voices
which don't develop into full-fledged people.  They are more like
background notes in a tone poem.</P>
<P>     LOVE JONES is the kind of film I would like to encourage, but I find
it hard to recommend it enthusiastically.  It's respectable, it's
admirable, it's smooth and smart and professional.  It's just not
particularly enjoyable.  Audiences have been jonesing for characters like
those in LOVE JONES, but they may be able to work up no more than a like
jones for this film.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 jones towns:  6.</PRE>
