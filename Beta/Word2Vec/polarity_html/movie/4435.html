<P>     RICHARD III -- it's Shakespeare that has nothing to do with Kenneth
Branagh.  Actually, at first glance, this film doesn't appear to have
anything to do with the Bard's play, either.  Opening in a 1930's
England war room with a tank crashing through a wall, one is immediately
struck by the realization that, whatever this movie is doing, it
certainly isn't preserving the story's original time frame.  However,
while the sets and costumes have been moved to a mythical, Nazi-like
pre-WWII England, the dialogue, characters, actions, and themes remain
unchanged from the original text by Shakespeare.  While this curious
clash between a near-modern setting and the much older source material
might seem confounding, it actually serves to energize the play, as well
as making it more palatable to present-day audiences.</P>
<P>     Being released at the same time as a new version of OTHELLO (which
has Branagh, along with Laurence Fishburn and Irene Jacob), RICHARD III
is likely either to usher in a new, mini-era of screen Shakespeare
revival, or show that two Shakespeare films are capable of glutting a
small marketplace.  OTHELLO is a far more traditional interpretation
than RICHARD III, and, other than authorship, about the only thing the
movies have in common is that both excise significant portions of
dialogue from the original text in the interest of saving time.</P>
<P>     RICHARD III is the last in the series of Shakespeare histories to
chronicle England's tribulations during the period before the Tudors
took the throne (an event which occurs at the end of RICHARD III, when
Henry VII, the first of the Tudors and grandfather to Shakespeare's
Queen Elizabeth, becomes King).  This play tells of the machinations of
Richard (Ian McKellan), a royal prince with a twisted spine and
grotesque physical appearance, to place himself in power.  Richard is a
spiteful person who kills without compunction and, in the process, earns
nothing but enmity from all around him.  There are four bodies that
impede his march to the crown:  two of his brothers -- Clarence and King
Edward -- and the king's two young sons.  One-by-one, Richard has them
removed, caring only that he should one day rule England.</P>
<P>     Sir Ian McKellan, a veteran of screen and stage, takes the title
role of Richard and turns in a performance that is equal parts
captivating magnetism and chilling menace.  It's an amazing piece of
acting that is worthy of notice at Oscar nomination time.  A fine cast
supports McKellan, including Kristin Scott-Thomas (FOUR WEDDINGS AND A
FUNERAL) as Anne, Richard's wife; Annette Bening (THE AMERICAN
PRESIDENT) as Queen Elizabeth; Nigel Hawthorne (THE MADNESS OF KING
GEORGE) as Clarence; John Wood (SABRINA) as King Edward; Jim Broadbent
(ENCHANTED APRIL) as Buckingham; Maggie Smith (THE SECRET GARDEN) as the
Duchess of York, Richard's mother; and Robert Downey Jr. (CHAPLIN) as
the queen's brother.</P>
<P>     Does Richard have a conscience?  Can evil such as his triumph
completely, with no recompense expected on this side of the grave?  Can
the British monarchy exist without venom and corruption filtering up to
the highest levels?  These are a few of the more cogent questions
addressed by RICHARD III, and McKellan and director Richard Loncraine
make sure that they remain intact in the final version of the film.</P>
<P>     In its own bloody way, RICHARD III is as enjoyable to watch as any
recent screen production of Shakespeare, and the shift to the 1930's
with its attendant Nazi imagery (parallels between Richard III and
Hitler abound) gives the film a twist that conventional productions do
not have.  If there's a flaw to the movie, it's that this is one of
Shakespeare's least ambitious and less thematically rich plays. 
Nevertheless, since the only memorable motion picture version is
Lawrence Olivier's 1956 version, RICHARD III doesn't suffer from
overexposure, and this new interpretation offers an unconventional-- and
easily accessible -- perspective. </P>
