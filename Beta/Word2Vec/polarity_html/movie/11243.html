<PRE>                            THE REAL BLONDE
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Like those sex comedies that used to be so popular, Mary and her
live-in boyfriend Joe spend a lot of time in bed arguing about sex in
the movie THE REAL BLONDE.  He doesn't think she is experimental and
aggressive enough, but she has a completely different perspective about
the quality of their sex life.  The net result is that they spend more
time bickering about it than doing it.</P>
<P>     As waiter and would-be actor Joe, Matthew Modine gives a witty and
wise performance.  Catherine Keener plays his girlfriend, Mary, who
definitely does not want a family, especially given Joe's minuscule
income.  They will both will be tempted by others -- he by a Madonna
body double and she by a women's self-defense instructor, played by a
remarkably low-key Denis Leary.</P>
<P>     As Joe's friend, fellow waiter and Royal Academy trained actor
Bob, Maxwell Caulfield gives the show's blandest performance.  When we
first meet Bob he is sneaking out of the bed of a gorgeous blonde named
Tina because he realizes that she is not a real blonde.  Elizabeth
Berkley from SHOWGIRLS plays the airhead, Tina, who doesn't have much
luck with her men no matter how beautiful she is.  Tina has strange
views on life.  As just one example, she finds THE LITTLE MERMAID and
all of the Disney cartoons quite spiritual.</P>
<P>     Yes, Bob will eventually meet a real blonde, a soap actress star
played by the lovely Daryl Hannah, who seems to look younger as she
gets older.  Bob runs into a slew of problems once he finds his real
blonde.</P>
<P>     The movie is filled with known actors in small performances that
are more than cameos but less than major parts.  Marlo Thomas plays an
ever resourceful fashion photographer.  When Tina, her big star, shows
up one day with an ugly, black eye, Thomas improvises.  Quick, paint
fake bruises on all of the models.  The injuries will go nicely with
the big snakes, a la the famous Nastassja Kinski photo.</P>
<P>     Christopher Lloyd shows up as a hard-driving head waiter who runs
his charges like they were recruits at boot camp.  Kathleen Turner
takes a small part as a tough minded agent who gets Joe a small part in
a Madonna music video.</P>
<P>     Steve Buscemi takes the role of a music video director.  He takes
one look at the pasty looking Joe with his boxer shorts and large rear
end and moves him to the back row of the male dancers.</P>
<P>     A subtheme in the picture is the sexual harassment of women on the
streets of New York City, where the film is set.  The women wear
see-through blouses, low-cut dresses, and short skirts, which arouses
the local winos and perverts.  They make lewd remarks at the women.
Joe, who seems most interested in the harassment issue, keeps reading
the lingerie and other ads and developing deep sounding but superficial
theories about their demeaning women.</P>
<P>     If the story sounds disorganized, it is.  Written and directed by
Tom DiCillo from BOX OF MOONLIGHT, the movie meanders, not going
anyplace in particular.  The film begins and ends with an unrelated
story of a stolen dog and has little structure.  Some of the jokes work
while others fall flat.</P>
<P>     In a restaurant scene Joe and Mary have dinner with a nouveau
riche artist friend of theirs and his wife.  The artist raves about the
movie  IL PIANO, and the two women agree.  Joe says the picture was
complete garbage, and soon every table in the restaurant is having
their own argument over the film.  This funny scene works so well
because it is at once outlandish and realistic.  When has someone not
praised a movie that you hated, but you tried to be polite and kept
your opinions to yourself or at least muted what you had to say?</P>
<P>     But for every good scene like the one above, there are others with
promise but no laughs.  When the meekest and homeliest woman in the
self-defense class is brought up to challenge the instructor, the scene
withers before ever it starts to bloom.  The joke is that she doesn't
attack him at all, which probably sounded funny in the script but is
staged with little style or impact.</P>
<P>     Although the light-weight film doesn't have much compelling
material, the cast gives it their all.  The result is a periodically
funny picture that does have its entertaining moments.</P>
<P>     THE REAL BLONDE runs 1:47.  It is rated R for nudity, sex and
profanity and would be fine for most teenagers.</P>
