<P>     "Okoge" is a Japanese word that describes the crust of burned rice
left in the bottom of a rice cooker.  In recent years, it has also come
to be used as a pejorative term for a woman who likes to hang around
with gay men.  In Takehiro Nakajima's film OKOGE, Sayoko (Misa Shimizu)
is such a person.  She is obviously both curious about the gay
lifestyle and free of the homophobic sentiments which permeate Japanese
society.  She meets Goh (Takehiro Murata) and his older lover Tochi
(Takeo Nakahara) at a gay beach and is so touched by their open
affection that she seeks out the pair and offers the use of her
apartment when they can't find a place to go to be alone.  It isn't
long before a close friendship develops among the trio, and Sayoko
becomes as much involved in the lives of Goh and Tochi as they do in
hers.</P>
<P>     First and foremost, OKOGE is an examination of the difficulties
faced by gay men in a society as conservative and restrictive as that
in Japan.  Actually, many of the themes of the movie, as well as the
problems encountered by the main characters, have universal
implications.  Switch things around a little and this tale could easily
occur in the United States.  Perhaps it takes a film from a different
country to bring into perspective one of America's more ugly
hypocrisies: the supposedly "free and open" society run by people with
closed minds.</P>
<P>     Too often, one of the problems with movies involving homosexual
themes and issues is a tendency to sermonize.  Both THE LIVING END and
CLAIRE OF THE MOON were guilty of this.  Instead of letting the
characters and story bring the message to the fore, each of those films
felt it necessary to preach about the evils of a homophobic society.
For the most part, OKOGE avoids this pitfall.  There are a few scenes
that are too obviously scripted (such as one in which a bunch of gay
men sit around debating whether their sexual preference is the result
of genetics or environment), but the movie generally allows the natural
flow of its plot to explore issues, rather than relying on unconvincing
contrivances.</P>
<P>     OKOGE also has a sense of humor.  Not a deadly-serious movie, this
is instead a picture that is unafraid to let the audience laugh.  Most
of the jokes are at the expense of the homophobes in the film, and they
are crafted skillfully enough to get the point across--and be
funny--without becoming condescending.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, all is far-from-perfect with OKOGE.  Instead of
being a cohesive whole, it's more like two films, each very different
in quality and tone from the other.  The only constant is the
characters.</P>
<P>     The first seventy-five minutes of OKOGE is a skillfully-done
character study, focusing on the unusual menage a trois that exists
between Sayoko, Goh, and Tochi.  All three characters are
skillfully-realized and well-developed, and the situations they find
themselves in are believable.  Then something happens to break one side
of the triangle.</P>
<P>     From that moment on, OKOGE is never the same.  It begins to wander
aimlessly, stumbling along as if unsure exactly where it wants to go.
Sayoko has an affair with a soldier, the reasons for which are left
murky and uncertain.  Goh tries a heterosexual experiment that ends in
disaster, and Tochi disappears altogether for a while.  There is a
sudden jump of about two years' time (which is left completely
unexplained by the movie--it takes about thirty seconds to figure out
what has happened), and everyone's circumstances have changed.  The
film takes its last twenty minutes to resolve the various messes that
the main trio have gotten themselves into.</P>
<P>     Although a little on the sweet side, the ending is nicely-done,
showing that love and sex don't have to be two sides to the same coin,
but there's nearly forty minutes of confusion between the excellent
beginning of OKOGE and its conclusion.</P>
<P>     I've never before seen Japanese actress Misa Shimizu, but her
performance in this film is an eye-opener.  She puts an incredible
amount of energy into her performance.  I'm not sure how the character
was written, but Shimizu's rendering of Sayoko positively sparkles.
The two male leads aren't quite as good, but neither Murata nor
Nakahara does a bad job.</P>
<P>     OKOGE may not be an ideal movie, but it goes a long way towards
removing the bad taste left behind by such heavy-handed efforts as THE
LIVING END and CLAIRE OF THE MOON.  Not only does it give an
intelligent, sympathetic portrayal of the difficulties of a gay
lifestyle, but it presents them from a woman's point-of-view.  Credit
should be given to Takehiro Nakajima for daring to make this film in a
country with such a rigid social structure.  The strengths of OKOGE
certainly outweigh the weaknesses.</P>
