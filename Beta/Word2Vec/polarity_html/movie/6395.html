<P>     For those who have forgotten the depth of romance and passion that 
the movies are capable of conveying, Anthony Minghella's THE ENGLISH 
PATIENT can remedy the situation.  This is one of the year's most 
unabashed and powerful love stories, using flawless performances, 
intelligent dialogue, crisp camera work, and loaded glances to attain a 
level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films 
miss.  </P>
<P>     Is THE ENGLISH PATIENT melodramatic?  Of course, but it's the sort 
of finely-honed melodrama that embraces viewers rather than smothering 
them.  And the movie never resorts to cheap, manipulative tactics.  This 
well-crafted story, brought to the screen with great care by British 
playwright and director Anthony Minghella (TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY) and 
based on the prize-winning novel by Michael Ondaatje, serves up the love 
of Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) and Katharine (Kristin Scott Thomas) in a way 
that is simultaneously epic and intimate.</P>
<P>     THE ENGLISH PATIENT has an elliptical structure, beginning with the 
same scene that it ends with.  In between, it moves several years into 
the future, and even further into the past.  The opening sequence, which 
takes place during World War II, shows a British plane being shot down 
over the North African desert.  The pilot, a Hungarian count named 
Laszlo Almasy, is badly burned in the ensuing crash.  Years later, in 
1944 Italy, we meet him again.  Although his outward injuries have 
healed, leaving his features scarred beyond recognition, he is dying.  
He has also supposedly lost his memory.  Hana (Juliette Binoche), the 
Canadian nurse who cares for him, takes him to an isolated, abandoned 
church to allow him to die in peace.  There, injecting him with morphine 
and reading to him from his beloved volume of Herodotus, Hana seeks to 
seeks to stimulate his memories.  Meanwhile, others arrive at the church 
-- a mysterious, crippled war veteran named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), 
who has a hidden agenda, and a pair of bomb experts, the British Sgt. 
Hardy (Kevin Whately) and his Sikh superior, Kip (Naveen Andrews), who 
becomes Hana's lover.</P>
<P>     Eventually, through dreams and waking flashbacks, Almasy's memories 
come flooding back, although Caravaggio asserts that he hasn't really 
forgotten anything -- he just wants to forget.  The story then flip-
flops between the present and a period during the late-'30s and early-
'40s, when Almasy is part of a British map-making effort surveying the 
Sahara.  It's then that he meets Katharine Clifton, the wife of a good-
natured pilot (Colin Firth) who is helping with the project.  Almasy and 
Katharine fall for each other, and the stage is set for a classic 
exploration of love and betrayal set against the dangerous background of 
Nazi aggression. </P>
<P>     The one flaw in THE ENGLISH PATIENT is related to an aspect of the 
structure.  The "modern-day" scenes with Almasy awaiting death aren't as 
nearly as involving as the flashback sequences.  The relationship 
between Hana and Kip lacks the intensity of the central romance, 
primarily because neither of them is a fully-realized character.  As a 
result, the scenes that take place in this time frame, some of which are 
quite lengthy, can be seen as unwanted interruptions.</P>
<P>     As is necessary for a movie of this tone and style, the acting is 
strong.  Ralph Fiennes gives us an Almasy who seems loosely based on 
CASABLANCA's Rick -- strong and silent until the right woman releases 
all of his pent-up passion.  Fiennes is the kind of actor who likes 
challenging himself with each new role (he has essayed vastly different 
personalities in SCHINDLER'S LIST, QUIZ SHOW, and STRANGE DAYS), and his 
work in THE ENGLISH PATIENT represents a continuation of that trend.  
Kristen Scott Thomas (FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL), sporting faux blonde 
hair, is luminous as Katharine, effortlessly conveying to the audience 
the energy and zest for life that Almasy finds irresistible.  Together, 
these two are hotter than the desert heat that simmers around them.  </P>
<P>     Juliette Binoche (BLUE) is delightful as Hana, although her 
character is frustratingly ill-developed.  Willem Dafoe (TOM AND VIV), 
the only American in the cast, plays the kind of mysterious role he has 
become accustomed to (primarily because he does it so well).  Solid 
supporting performances are turned in by Naveen Andrews as Kip, Colin 
Firth (PRIDE AND PREJUDICE), as Katharine's husband, and Julian Wadham 
(THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE) as Almasy's best friend, Madox.</P>
<P>     THE ENGLISH PATIENT is the sort of intelligent, epic love story 
that seems so rare these days.  There's something about this film that 
lingers long after the end credits have rolled -- a desire to re-
experience all the feelings generated by the movie, perhaps.  One of the 
reasons for THE ENGLISH PATIENT's power is that it strikes universal 
chords.  This motion picture is yet another example of how the patience 
of movie-goers, after being sorely tried during the first eight mediocre 
months of 1996, is being rewarded by a surge of excellent end-of-the-
year releases.</P>
