<P>     Though you can't believe a minute of this rousing, racial drama,
you can certainly *enjoy* yourself.  The plot-- about a good ol'
Arkansas boy (Robert Duvall) who discovers, meets, and eventually
befriends his black half-brother (James Earl Jones)-- is absurd, sure,
but the dialogue crackles and the actors sparkle.  Though Duvall is a
bit too tightlipped, his foil, James Earl Jones, is fantastic.  (I love
his range: cowering and commanding all at once.  After this and CRY, THE
BELOVED COUNTRY, it's *great* to see Jones emerge from behind all of
those voice-overs and assorted supporting roles.) As good as their
unexpected chemistry gets, both Jones and Duvall pale before
schoolteacher-turned-actress Irma P. Hall.  Her scene-stealing
performance as their blind-but-still-sees-everything aunt is one of the
first Oscar-worthy turns of the year.  Directed by Richard Pearce (LEAP
OF FAITH). </P>
