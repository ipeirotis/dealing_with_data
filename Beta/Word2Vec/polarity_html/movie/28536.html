<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An old-fashioned love story that is more vague than uplifting.
First-time director Mercedes Garcia-Guevara, a second cousin to
Argentina-born rebel Che-Guevera, has created a moody meditational piece
about a woman falling in love with her husband's brother. It becomes a
story of a woman who has lived a lie in her comfortable city life and
finds a peace of mind in the simpleness of country life that rings true
to her nature. It plays more like an art-house film than as a realistic
drama. The woman character immerses herself in raw nature as a means of
reinvigorating her energy and escaping from her dull life.</P>
<P>The film opens as interior designer Ana (Paola Krum) tucks her six year
old Tomy to bed while her high-powered executive husband Luis (Cedron)
is out of the country on business, and then opens a mysterious letter
addressed to her husband. During the day, she stopped by his office and
discovered the letter from a woman. The letter is a 'thank you' one, for
him sending money for child support; there's also a child's drawing
enclosed. She tells her work partner Greta that she suspects her husband
of having a secret family; and, has impulsively decided to fly from
Buenos Aires to visit her husband's hometown of Hidden River, a place
far from the big city. It's a remote rural village at the foot of the
Andes Mountains in western Argentina.</P>
<P>After her plane ride, Ana learns that Hidden River is still two hours
away, so she rents a pickup truck and is surprised to find that she's at
a children's home. Here, she meets Lucio (Elías Carrasco), a six year
old boy, who turns out to be the son of her husband's brother, Martín
(Juan Palomino), a man she didn't know existed. Martín has so far served
six years in the nearby prison for murder but he gets a furlough on
Sundays, and he hitchhikes to Hidden River to spend the day secretly
watching his son as he plays by the river with the other children.</P>
<P>When Ana gives Martín a lift without telling him who she is, she begins
to doubt her life and the love she has for husband. She's impressed by
Martín's quiet demeanor and frankness, and his rugged good looks. Soon
she can't leave him, as something comes over her that is pressing deeply
from within her. She follows him to an abandoned farmhouse he goes to
and will later on learn that was her husband's childhood home.</P>
<P>The camera does a beautiful job of catching the raw countryside of
Hidden Valley in long sweeping shots of its splendid mountain ranges and
its raw terrain, and its magnificent forest. While here, Ana questions
her roots and her past in these serene surroundings; while hubby, back
in Buenos Aires, is only interested in business and can't communicate
with her anything but surface things. What happens next is too murky and
not convincingly established to be totally believable, as things moved
too fast without the viewer seeing what was happening; not enough is
ever revealed for us to comprehend what is behind her sudden conflict,
except for her husband's lies and her fatal attraction for his brother.
The film had a sad mood throughout and this was reinforced by Martín
Bauer's musical score for classic Argentinean guitar and cello, which
played in the background throughout the film. There even seems to be a
hint that Martín is too gentle a person and could not have possibly
committed murder, except nothing is ever settled for sure. Even the
moving performance by Paola Krum cannot uncover what the film is
lacking. It remains too obscure, locked up too tightly in Paola Krum's
mind.</P>
