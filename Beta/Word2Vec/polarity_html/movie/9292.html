<P>     If you accept Hollywood's version of things, history -- particularly
the uglier parts of history -- is what happens while white people are
watching.  It's not terribly surprising, since studios generally balk at
anything remotely depressing; fears can be allayed if an established
Anglo actor anchors such projects.  So we end up with revolution in South
America through the eyes of James Woods in SALVADOR, the plight of Native
Americans as seen by Kevin Costner in DANCES WITH WOLVES, upheaval in
Burma as it affects Patricia Arquette in BEYOND RANGOON...not one of them
a terrible film, but each one compromised by the sense that we couldn't be
trusted to identify with a dark face.  In fact, these stories aren't even
about the culture involved.  They're "the story of one man's/woman's
awakening set against the backdrop of..."</P>
<P>     ...in this case, Tibet.  SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET is the story of
Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt), an arrogant Austrian mountaineer who leaves
his preganat wife at home on the eve of World War II to scale the
Himalayan peak of Nanga Parbat.  Unfortunately, the expedition meets an
abrupt end when the climbers are taken as prisoners of war by the British
when war is officially declared.  Eventually Heinrich escapes along with
fellow Austrian Peter Aufschneiter (David Thewlis), and the two men try to
make their way from India through Tibet to Axis-friendly China.  In Tibet
they find an isolated, alien culture which only gradually comes to accept
them.  Particularly accepting is the 14-year-old Dalai Lama himself
(Jamyang Wangchuk), who becomes fascinated with Heinrich's knowledge of
the outside world and makes him a trusted advisor.  Heinrich, in turn,
becomes devoted to the young spiritual leader, joining the Tibetan people
in facing the threat which comes after the Communist victory in China.</P>
<P>     There is a lot to like about individual moments, technical skill and
overall atmosphere in SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET.  An early mountain-climbing
sequence is tense and restrained, the location photography is spectacular,
and the performances of Thewlis and Wangchuk (enchanting as the wise yet
playful Dalai Lama) are solid and appealing.  The relationship between
Heinrich and the Dalai Lama is the most effective element in the film,
smartly rendered by Becky Johnston's script.  It takes a while for SEVEN
YEARS to reach that relationship, but it's well-developed once it becomes
the film's focus.</P>
<P>     It's often hard to see that focus, however, because SEVEN YEARS IN
TIBET is an epic which feels like it's rushing frantically from place to
place.  There's a lot of ground to cover in Harrer's story, probably more
than 135 minutes can cover, but that's all we get.  The Nanga Parbat
expedition abruptly crashes into the POW camp sequences, which crash into
a montage of wandering through the mountains, which collides with a
capture by bandits, which trickles into the first arrival in Lhasa.
Months pass in the space between voice-overs, leaving gaps in the
development of the story's force.  Rather than finding the solid narrative
through-line and sticking with it, the script hunts and pecks for dramatic
events over a decade of time.</P>
<P>     Of course, SEVEN YEARS' narrative through-line is the emotional and
spiritual growth of Harrer, so it's hard to say whether that would have
been an improvement.  It's not that Pitt does a bad job as Harrer, though
his Austrian accent wanders from here to there.  In fact, he does a fine
job of making Harrer more than just a cocky rascal; he's thoroughly
self-absorbed to the point of needing a good spanking.  But Pitt could
give the performance of a lifetime, and we'd still be left with a film
which doesn't seem to have its priorities straight.  It's true that even a
sweeping story needs a protagonist to give broad-scale suffering a human
face, but that face doesn't have to be topped by a head of blond hair. 
If SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET had not attempted to be more than the biography of
an interesting man, I might have enjoyed it much more.  Instead, its
attempts to be a "message" film end up delivering the wrong messages. 
While the Chinese conquest of Tibet warrants about five minutes of screen
time in SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET, Harrer's project building a movie theater
for the Dalai Lama gets twice that.  It's ironic, in a way:  even within
the film, the media of the West threaten to overwhelm another culture.</P>
