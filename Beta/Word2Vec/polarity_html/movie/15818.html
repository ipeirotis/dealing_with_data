<P>     There's something very strange going on at Ohio's Herrington High in 
THE FACULTY.  It's something only six students -- sensitive drug dealer
Zeke (Josh Hartnett), tormented geek Casey (Elijah Wood), black-clad loner
Stokely (Clea DuVall), cheerleader Delilah (Jordana Brewster), quarterback
Stan (Shawn Hatosy) and sweet new girl in school Marybeth (Laura Harris)
--  seem to recognize.  It starts in the faculty, including the football
coach (Robert Patrick) and the principal (Bebe Neuwirth), then slowly
spreads to their classmates.  Herrington High has been overtaken by... a
world-shaking case of deja vu. </P>
<P>     It's not just that another film from earlier this year, DISTURBING
BEHAVIOR, already suggested a sinister conspiracy to turn high school
students into obedient robots.  Deconstructionist screen scribe Kevin
Williamson managed a tightrope act across the fine line between homage
and outright theft in SCREAM and SCREAM 2.  In THE FACULTY, he stomps that
fine line into a fine paste.  The Tommy Hilfiger-bedecked sextet of
protagonists shows the meticulous cross-sectioning of THE BREAKFAST CLUB.
Their test of each other's humanity is a crib from John Carpenter's THE
THING.  Their last stand locked away from the Menace Out There recalls
NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, ALIENS, and any number of other science fiction
thrillers.  It's a monster movie that could not exist without the
existence of other -- and much better -- movies.</P>
<P>     Of course, some will argue that such is entirely the point of any
Williamson project, that he shows off the conventions of genre films so he
can revitalize them.  The problem is that there is nothing remotely
revitalizing about THE FACULTY.  Sure, it's a movie movie, but its quotes
are as witlessly regurgitated as in any number of recent Leslie Nielsen
projects.  Instead of having something clever to say about cliches, it
simply recycles them, tossing in the occasional reference to "The Puppet
Masters" or ALIEN's Ripley as though it suddenly makes all the trite
characterizations and profanely insult-filled dialogue tolerable.  Even
Elijah Wood's wide-eyed genuineness and some pseudo-analysis of teenage
desire for conformity can't rescue THE FACULTY from feeling exactly like
the "attractive teens in jeopardy" tales it supposedly derides.</P>
<P>     If THE FACULTY proves anything, it's how much Williamson needs Wes
Craven.  Both SCREAM films featured chilling sequences which could stand
with the best the genre had to offer; they showed what chould be great
about horror films even as they showed what could be awful about them.
Robert Rodriguez -- who, if nothing else, has always shown that he has an
electrifying sense of cinematic pacing -- seemingly has no idea what to do
with this material.  THE FACULTY drifts sluggishly from character to
character as though they actually mattered, and the few action sequences
are designed to show off alien effects.  Every opportunity for genuine
creativity is turned into yet another self-satisfied commentary on how
every science-fiction story is really a rip-off of some other 
science-fiction story.</P>
<P>     There are a couple of amusing moments in THE FACULTY -- a football
game in which the Herrington team "infects" the opposition during dogpile
tackles, for instance -- but even most of those are taken from other
films.  Williamson's name is supposed to make this a knowing satire of
alien takeover films like INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, but there was
more inventive humor in a piece of cheese like 1985's killer yogurt film
THE STUFF.  I kept waiting for either fun or fear, and all I got was a
jokey cameo by Internet gossip guru Harry "Ain't-It-Cool" Knowles.  THE
FACULTY merely adds to the list of lame science fiction films for someone
else to satirize...and maybe even get it right next time.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 alien-ated teens:  3.</PRE>
