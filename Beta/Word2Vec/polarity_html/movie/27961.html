<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Zhang Yimou ("Raise the Red Lantern") has securely grounded a "feel
good" film with characters who have greatly touched me, even though the
film is bogged down with much communist propaganda and it ends like a
typical Hollywood "feel good" movie, in this case with too much good
cheer over nothing much accomplished to make it so proud about itself.
Nevertheless, this is a brilliantly directed austere film for the most
part, telling about ordinary people in a very poor, rural village in
China's Hebei Province. It held my interest as I observed the classroom
dynamics taking place in a broken down one-room schoolhouse and in the
contrasting lifestyle shown in the modern Chinese city. These are human
interest stories I have not seen before about the new China, presented
here in such an informal way. The cast of mostly nonprofessional actors,
playing themselves, acquitted their task with a spirited performance,
giving power to the story about the problems with rural education for
the poor people of that region.</P>
<P>"Not One Less" tells about the duplicitous mayor (Tian Zhenda) of the
rural village forced to bring a 13-year-old girl from a farm family, Wei
Minzhi, to be a substitute teacher in the Shuixian Primary School
(grades one through four) when the regular teacher, an elderly man, Gao
Enman, has to leave the area for a month to be with his ailing mother
and there is no one else available. In her chat with the regular
teacher, we see that she not only doesn't look like a teacher but more
like the students she is about to teach and, that, she also lacks the
proper educational skills to function as a teacher. Her only gift is
that she knows a few lines of one patriotic song to teach the children,
which she sings in an off key voice. To compensate for her inadequacies,
Teacher Gao, a dedicated teacher, leaves her 26 lessons she is to write
on the board for the month he is gone and 26 precious pieces of chalk,
as she will have the students copy her boardwork in their notebooks. He
admonishes her not to write the characters too large, because the chalk
will run out. The characters should be about the size of a donkey turd.
The chalk is in such short-supply, that the classroom monitor tells her,
he scrapes pieces of it off the floor to use.</P>
<P>Worried about receiving the 50 yuan pay she is promised, she is told
that she will receive it when he returns if she keeps the 28 pupils she
has, not one less. Teacher Gao says he keeps losing these primary grade
students who drop-out to work, as he has already lost 10 pupils this
year, and even though he hasn't been paid in 6 months, he will give her
a small bonus of 10 yuan from his own pocket if she keeps the class
intact.</P>
<P>Teacher Wei has difficulty getting her class to respect her and call her
teacher, she also can't handle the class troublemaker, an always smiling
11-year-old bully named Zhang Huike. But she can be bossy when she has
to, and looks upon her main role as keeping the same number of students
she was given. Her first major problem arises when a girl who is spotted
as a fast runner, is taken away by a city school recruiting her for her
athletic ability, as this upsets Teacher Wei who is only interested in
keeping her pupil and getting her bonus at the end of the month. Not
able to keep her, the mayor tells her to stop worrying, it's good for
the girl and Teacher Gao will understand that he lost a pupil who wants
to better herself and not one who dropped-out.</P>
<P>The teacher's idea of teaching, is to sit outside in front of the
classroom door and make sure no one leaves, never mind what mischief or
learning goes on inside the classroom. The film is based on the novel by
Shi Xiangsheng, who was a teacher in a rural school and should therefore
know how shoddy education could be in such places.</P>
<P>When Zhang Huike is missing from school and Teacher Wei goes to his
house and speaks to his sick mother and finds that the family has debts,
that the father is dead, and that Zhang went into the city to get work,
she can only think of getting the address of his workplace in the city
and going there herself to bring him back. But the mayor will not give
her transportation to the city and shrugs his shoulder, saying that's
just the way it is with poor people around here. The resolute girl tries
to shake down her class for bus fare to the city, but the class is too
poor to come up with the money needed. But when a student says you can
get money by carrying bricks, the teacher brings the children there and
gets some of the money needed to get her to the city by the class doing
labor work. This leads to the only lesson she ever thought, as she has
the children do the math for this real-life problem, of trying to figure
out how many bricks it would take to move before she has enough for
round-trip bus fare. It's a communal effort, since her math is not much
better than her student's.</P>
<P>The selfish teacher finds herself bewildered in the big city of
Jiangjiakou and is further disappointed that Zhang never showed up to
work, but ran away from the girl he came with, as he left her to go for
a pee in the train station and never returned. In this
government-sanctioned pic, the story was really absorbing up to this
point, but it now takes a radical turn for the worst, as the teacher
decides to find Zhang and bring him back to school no matter what
suffering it takes on her part to do it. Supposedly, she is no longer
doing it out of her own selfishness, but in her inarticulate and
resolute way she has learned what it is to be a teacher and care about
her pupils, all she's still missing are the skills.</P>
<P>After spending all her money to write messages about the lost boy and
finding out it is useless to go to the police, they're just too busy for
this kind of job (which struck me as either strange or very revealing
about modern China), she ends up listening to a stranger in the train
station who tells her to go to the TV station. After unsuccessfully
trying to see the TV station manager, she ends up sleeping on the street
and does this for a day and a half, until the manager, who turns out to
be sensitive to her plight, gets her onto a popular Oprah-like show, and
she tearfully connects again with Zhang, who was seen wandering the
streets and begging for food in a restaurant. This looked so unreal,
that I thought the last reel got mixed in with one of those typical
Hollywood films of this kind. Though, what was interesting about this
part of the film, was taking a gander at the city and how clean and
boring and crowded it looked. Unfortunately, the film never recovered
from this artificial twist to the story and concluded with Chinese TV
donors sending in money to pay off Zhang's family debts and the school
is given many school supplies to take care of its scarcity and enough
money to build a new schoolhouse to replace this broken down one. The
message of the film was unnecessarily delivered in a heavy-handed
manner, about the poor conditions of China's rural schools.</P>
<P>The film was so adeptly done and looked and felt so good, and the parts
of all the people were played by those playing themselves in such a
natural way, that I didn't see its downfall coming until it was too late
and, anyway, by that time I was really getting off on the film and was
amazed by the simple daily life rhythms of the schoolchildren and the
common villagers, that I was already hooked on liking the film. I
especially found the performance of Wei Minzhi to be impactful. I was
taken in by the simplicity of who she was and the truth in her
character, and the way she was still an innocent child, who because of
her cultural background was obedient and took on the responsibilities of
being a substitute teacher, something that she knew she had no ability
for but reluctantly had to do, even if she couldn't explain why. This
fictional story was better than the message delivered, and the film is
much better than it sounds, given the aforementioned flaws it has, it
still shows the power of human love over all the coldness in the world.</P>
