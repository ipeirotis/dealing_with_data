<P>     Someone once said this about the United States' justice system:  
"If ten guilty men must go free to prevent one innocent man from falsely 
going to prison, so be it."  This philosophy explains why, at least in 
theory, every accused criminal is presumed innocent until proven 
otherwise.  At some point, however, our approach to justice in this 
country became warped.  So, if the system is broken, is it possible to 
get a fair trial?  This is a crucial question, and, if we accept the 
evidence presented in Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky's PARADISE LOST, 
the sobering answer may be "no", at least in certain high-profile cases.</P>
<P>     Berlinger and Sinofsky, who made 1992's BROTHERS KEEPER, have 
stated that they initially approached this project as an examination of 
America's disaffected youth.  What they uncovered during the course of 
filming radically changed the movie's direction.  PARADISE LOST became a 
trial of the American justice system, and, to a lesser extent, a 
condemnation of the media's lack of objectivity.  Other documentaries, 
such as THE THIN BLUE LINE and BROTHERS KEEPER, have followed similar 
paths, but none with the devastating impact of PARADISE LOST.</P>
<P>     On the night of May 5, 1993, three eight-year old boys, Steven 
Branch, Christopher Byers, and Michael Moore, were tortured and murdered 
in Robin Hood Hills, West Memphis, Arkansas.  The community, 
understandably outraged, cried out for blood.  It took the police a 
month to make arrests.  The eventual suspects were Jessie Misskelly, age 
17; Damien Echols, age 18; and Jason Baldwin, age 16.  Jessie, who has a 
72 IQ and was subjected to a grueling 10-hour interrogation, confessed 
to his involvement in the killings, but later recanted the confession, 
claiming to have been coerced.  He was tried, convicted, and sentenced 
to life plus 40 years.  Likewise, Damien and Jason were found guilty.  
Damien was sentenced to die by lethal injection; Jason was to spend the 
rest of his life in jail without the possibility of parole.</P>
<P>     PARADISE LOST follows events surrounding the crime, from the 
discovery of the bodies (as shown in a graphic police crime scene video) 
to the verdicts.  Berlinger and Sinofsky painstakingly chronicle ten 
months worth of developments, illustrating how easily justice can be 
swayed.  There's no way that this movie can answer the question of the 
defendants' guilt or innocence, but one piece of information is clear 
from PARADISE LOST:  Jessie Misskelly, Damien Echols, and Jason Baldwin 
did not receive fair trials.  </P>
<P>     There was almost no physical evidence connecting the three to the 
crime.  Jessie's confession was, at best, obtained under dubious 
circumstances.  But the town of West Memphis needed scapegoats, people 
they could demonize.  Because Damien was "different" by his own 
admission -- he wore black, listened to Metallica, and had shown 
interest in the Wicca religion -- he made an excellent target.  Jessie 
and Jason were guilty by association.  Suddenly, news reports were full 
of allegations of Satanic rituals and occult ceremonies, with 
intimations of human sacrifice and sexual perversity.  Damien, Jessie, 
and Jason were tried in and convicted by the media.  They didn't have a 
chance in court.  Oddly, however, the three weren't fazed by their 
convictions.  Their families exhibited far more distress than they did.</P>
<P>     Berlinger and Sinofsky have obtained an amazingly in-depth and 
intimate picture of the situation.  Their cameras were allowed in the 
courtrooms, behind closed-door strategy sessions, and in the prisons 
where the accused were being held.  The friends and families of the 
victims and the defendants cooperated with the film makers, enabling 
them to get close to both sides.  As a result, there are no faceless 
entities here -- all of the participants have personalities.</P>
<P>     DADETOWN, an earlier 1996 release, questioned the role of 
documentary film makers in examining their subjects, and this issue is 
raised in PARADISE LOST when a knife given to Berlinger and Sinofsky by 
a victim's father is introduced as a piece of evidence.  Suddenly, the 
documentarians were no longer detached observers, but participants.  
And, while it's unlikely that their "contribution" affected the outcome, 
it's impossible to say for certain.  Ultimately, however, when you 
consider the nature of PARADISE LOST's main concerns, this matter is of 
secondary importance.</P>
<P>     Arthur Miller's THE CRUCIBLE, which is due in theaters this fall, 
offers the Salem Witch trials as a parallel to McCarthyism.  PARADISE 
LOST shows that witch hunts didn't end centuries, or even decades, ago.  
Religious fanaticism fueled much of the hatred against Damien, Jessie, 
and Jason.  The mere hint of Satanism doomed their cases, even if their 
only real crimes were listening to heavy metal music, wearing strange 
clothing, and holding unconventional beliefs.  There's much about these 
three that we'll never know, but the scary thing is that the men and 
women of West Memphis don't care about those gaps.  Truth has become far 
less important than closure.  And it doesn't matter that, if these boys 
are innocent, the real killers are still free.  Equally disturbing is 
the underlying hypocrisy typified by one scene:  a victim's father leads 
his fundamentalist congregation in song, then is shown making vicious 
jokes as he uses a gun to blast holes in a pumpkin he alternately names 
Damien, Jessie, and Jason.</P>
<P>     No documentary released in 1996 challenges an audience the way this 
one does.  The questions it proposes are profound, and there are no 
answers.  PARADISE LOST is one of a very few films that completely 
absorbs the attention.  Watching Berlinger and Sinofsky's movie is like 
witnessing an execution:  it's horrifying, gut-wrenching, and impossible 
to turn away from.  Anyone with an interest in law and order, the 
American justice system, or the role of the media in trials, should seek 
it out.  PARADISE LOST is the kind of film that will leave even the most 
devout defendants of the legal system either shaken or shaking their 
heads.</P>
