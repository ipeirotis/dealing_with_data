<PRE>                           THE SWEET HEREAFTER
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<PRE>          For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,
          Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew,
          And flowers put forth a fairer hue,
          and everything was strange and new.</PRE>
<PRE>               -Robert Browning, "The Pied Piper of Hamelin"</PRE>
<P>     THE SWEET HEREAFTER could serve as a textbook example of the
difference between television movies and "real" movies.  Consider for a
moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a
fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved --
lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and
toothpaste.</P>
<P>     Top-flight writer and director Atom Egoyan delivers instead a film
with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching
subtlety.  Based on a respected book of the same name by author Russell
Banks, the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure, not
merely a literal adaptation of the novel.  Told in linear form by four
narrators in the book, Egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping
time sequences and without a narrator.  The author is even on record as
applauding Egoyan's changes.</P>
<P>     In the press notes the book's author describes the story as "a
parable of lost children."  He says it asks what a town does in the
absence of its children.  Picking up on this, Egoyan has a flashback in
which a sitter, Nicole Burnell, played with grace by Sarah Polley,
reads parts of "The Pied Piper" from an old, illustrated book to her
two charges.   Periodically throughout the picture, Nicole's readings
are heard in voice-over.  You have never heard this moving poem read so
sweetly or in such an appropriate moment.  They and the rest of the
town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are
seriously injured.  And the entire small Canadian town where the
accident occurs is never the same again.  Although the physical damage
is inflicted mainly on the children, the adults bear the emotional
scars of the loss.</P>
<P>     Ian Holm, in arguably the best performance of his distinguished
career, plays Mitchell Stephens, an intense man of quiet misery.
Mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small, snow-encrusted
community in the British Columbian wilderness.  His mission there is a
singular one, to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone,
anyone, on their behalf.  If this seems crass, well it is, but Mitchell
approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot.</P>
<P>     The story unfolds slowly and always believably.  Each little
aspect has its own fascination.  As Mitchell interviews Wendell and
Rita Walker, played with quiet realism by Maury Chaykin and Alberta
Watson, he has a simple task.  He wants them to suggest some model
couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that
couple to form the basis of the suit.  Wendell ticks off one town
member after another and then, as one can in a small town, enumerates
each person's numerous faults.</P>
<P>     Although the town is no Peyton Place, people there do have their
foibles.  One of the best parents in the town appears to be Billy
Ansell (Bruce Greenwood), who rides his pickup behind the school bus
everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids.  Well, single parent
Billy's fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the
married Rita.  His confessions to Rita about his feelings of loss are
one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story.</P>
<P>     The accident itself, a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice,
isn't shown until the middle of the picture, but, nevertheless, the
mystery about it builds throughout the film.  Although the picture is
no detective story, finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in
a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by
tragedy.</P>
<P>     As the injured bus driver, Gabrielle Rose, Dolores Driscoll plays
the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and
for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning.</P>
<P>     To round out the story, Mitchell has his own private tragedy to
bear.  His daughter Zoe (Caerthan Banks) is a drug addict who has
bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after
another.  Fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for
money or help, she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments
as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk.  ("I can help you," Mitchell
tries to reassure Billy.  "Not unless you can raise the dead," Billy
snaps back.  Mitchell's pitch is never an easy one and worrying about
Zoe only makes it harder.)</P>
<P>     Mychael Danna's haunting music sets the stage for tragedy.  The
cinematography by Paul Sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur, but
it is in the warm, shadowy, intimate moments indoors where it works
best.</P>
<P>     The show, which is ripe for emotional manipulation, never plays
with its audience.  Still, when the house lights go up, you may feel as
I did.  I could barely breathe; I was so overcome by the sum total of
what I had witnessed.</P>
<P>     More than anything, the film is like a master painting.  Each
cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by Egoyan with the beauty
building with each dollop of paint.  With the final color in place, the
masterpiece is complete, and the ending credits roll.</P>
<P>     THE SWEET HEREAFTER runs 1:50.  It is rated R for mature themes,
sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers.</P>
