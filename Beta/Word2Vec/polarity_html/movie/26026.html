<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is the director Akira Kurosawa's international breakthrough film,
garnering many  awards, including Hollywood's 1952 Best Foreign Language
Film Oscar and The Golden Lion Award, at the 1951 Venice film festival.
Rashomon became incorporated into the everyday language, and Japanese
films became a regular part of the western world's film culture mainly
because of this film. The strength of the film lies in its attempt to
show how the search for the truth is laden with traps, as all four
narrators of the horrid event depicted are supposedly telling the truth
according to what they believe they saw but their truths still turn out
to be veiled in mystery. In the intellectual scheme of this puzzler,
Kurosawa determines that the truth cannot be found because 'the truth is
relative.'</P>
<P>The film is blemished only by Kurosawa's backtracking at the conclusion,
coming up with an unconvincing and hokey humanistic ending to counter
his more potent argument that everyone lies for selfish reasons.</P>
<P>Set in the 12th century of the ravaged capital city of Kyoto, the film
offers four very different versions of an ambush, rape and murder in the
woods. What makes the film special besides its interesting philosophical
theme, is the high-powered performances, especially the one by Toshiro
Mifune as the manic bandit Tajomaru, and in the frenetic movements of
the camera (whether slow or fast paced) and the way it captured the
intensity of the film, giving it its sense of urgency. This was a unique
filming device used by Kurosawa, of zooming in on the character when
telling his or her version, as each had a different rhythm that the
camera underscored by revealing the particular mood of the storyteller.</P>
<P>Waiting out a rain storm in a decaying shelter, where there is an
ancient gate called Rashomon, three people: a woodcutter (Shimura), a
Buddhist priest (Chiaki), and a common man (Ueda), kill some time by
listening to a true story told by the priest and the woodcutter. The
story was recently told before a magistrate and it shocked both the
priest and the woodcutter, lamenting how evil mankind has become. The
common man is not surprised that mankind is selfish, as he takes a
cynical view of humanity, anyway, listening to the story as if it's just
a typical murder one.</P>
<P>The woodcutter tells how he found the body of the murdered husband and
then quickly ran back to report it to the police, telling them he just
found the body and didn't see what happened. Later on he will tell the
other two what he really saw, unable to contain himself anymore from his
version of the truth. This comes after he goes over again in his mind
the other three versions told from the viewpoint of the bandit, the
woman, and the murdered man through a medium, and he decidedly becomes
saddened that mankind has sunk to a new low level of morality, hoping to
speak out against that.</P>
<P>The captured bandit will freely confess to the police that he raped the
woman and murdered the husband in a gallant duel for her. He sets up his
story by blaming a breeze blowing that day for what was to take place.
When a beautiful veiled lady (Kyo) astride a horse, with her warrior
husband (Mori) walking alongside her in the woods comes into his view, a
breeze blows the veil away from her and he sees how beautiful she is and
decides he must have her, even if he must kill the husband. Though, he
says, his intention was not to kill the husband unless it was necessary.
He mentions how by greed he lured the husband away from his wife on the
main road, taking him deep into the woods by telling him he has buried
some valuable swords there, which he will sell to him cheaply. When he
gets to the isolated spot, he fights with the husband until he overcomes
him and ties him up, and then goes back for the woman. He admires her
for the spirited way she resists him but soon she encourages him to take
her, as he rapes her in front of her husband. She then insists, that to
protect her honor, he must fight a duel with her husband and whomever
wins will have her. He then kills the husband in an exciting duel for
her. But, she flees from the scene and the bandit claims that he didn't
run after her.</P>
<P>The woman's version is quite different, as each narrator tells a version
that makes them look good. Her version tells how she acted with courage,
honor, and dignity. She mentions that after the rape the bandit
mockingly laughed at her and ran off into the woods. There was no duel.
The husband looked at her coldly after the rape and wouldn't forgive her
for dishonoring him, as she accidently stabbed him with her dagger after
offering him the dagger to kill her. She asks the court, What should a
poor, defenseless woman like me do?</P>
<P>The murdered man's version is presented to the magistrate through a
medium. He mentions how after the rape the cunning bandit successfully
consoled his wife, who looked more beautiful than she ever looked
before. He told her that he loves her and she agrees to run away with
him, but not before insisting that he kill her husband. The husband says
this despicable act by his wife even revolted the bandit and he adopted
the same masculine code as the samurai by throwing the woman to the
ground and asking if he wanted his wife slain. He says he almost forgave
the bandit for acting honorable at that point. Meanwhile, the woman ran
away and the bandit unsuccessfully chased after her. The grieving
husband couldn't bear his suffering anymore and committed suicide with
the dagger.</P>
<P>The woodcutter then tells the men in the shelter his revised version of
what happened, which might be the closest we come to the truth since his
only motive for lying was greed, but even his version is also not
certain, as the woodcutter is a proven liar, having stolen the dagger
and therefore he covered up his part in the story he told to the police.
But he is now seemingly disgusted with the other three versions put
forth, which only made the presenter look good and made him wary of
mankind, and since his telling of the story is now more objective, the
greater is the chance that it is closer to the truth. He tells the story
after the rape and has the bandit pleading with the woman to run away
with him, saying that if she marries him he will give up being a thief
and get an honest job to support her. Her reply is not with words, but
to cut with her dagger the ropes that bind her husband, indicating they
must fight a duel for her. But instead of fighting the samarai chickens
out, calling his wife a whore, and saying she is not worth dying for.
The wife then gets up enough courage to taunt the two men for being
cowards, which gets them to reluctantly start their duel. Both men are
frightened and the duel is an awkward and cowardly one, with both men
stumbling and retreating, with finally the husband cringing out of fear
and begging not to be killed, as the abject bandit slays him and the
woman flees. The bandit soon staggers off bewildered in another
direction. The duel was seen as a parody: 1) Of how the brave samurai is
supposed to conduct himself. 2) Of how the bandit is supposed to be
fearless 3) Of how the woman is supposed to be virteous. All three
participants are shown to have poor character.</P>
<P>For Kurosawa, Rashomon is a film about the lies people tell to protect
their self-image. The truth is subjective and can't be believed in its
entirety because of each narrator's ego.</P>
<P>To soften the blow of all the cynicism in regards to the rape-murder,
Kurosawa suddenly has an abandoned baby conveniently wake up and cry
just as all the storytelling is concluded in the shelter. The crude
common man thereby steals the gifts the baby was left with and shows no
concern for the helpless baby, but the priest and the woodcutter reach
out to help the baby, with the priest clutching the baby, at first,
misunderstanding the woodcutter's gesture to help, but the woodcutter
seeks to adopt the baby as his seventh child. This contrived ending is
supposed to show that there are still those who will unselfishly reach
out to help others.</P>
<P>The film has not aged that well, though it seems to still be a powerful
picture but, in my opinion, not the masterpiece it was once thought of.
I think the same reevaluation will take place of Kurosawa's long and
distinguished career and he will be downgraded from being crowned as a
great director to a very good one. He seems to suffer in most of his
films from too much sentimentality and contrivances, though his strong
filming techniques and very muscular camera work, as exhibited in this
film, will remain his ultimate trademark.</P>
