<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A slow, meandering train ride back from the dead, for the Jews liberated
by the Russians from the concentration camp of Auschwitz, Poland,
towards the end of WW11, April of 1945, marks this morosely dramatic
English-languagefilm directed by the 75-year-old noted Marxist and
politically orientated Francesco Rosi (Salvatore Giuliano, Three
Brothers). It was filmed in the Ukraine, supposedly in the same places
the then 29-year-old  Primo Levi was detained at. John Turturro is Primo
Levi, the nativeTurin chemist and author of many books on his
confinement, including this autobiographical look at his observations on
survival and what it means to be liberated, and it also offers his
lifelong take on what the dignity of man means to him.</P>
<P>The film should be like a meditation, as the introspective Primo wants
to get it out of his system what it meant to be a Jewish prisoner and
how it was unbearable to come out of that camp and think that you could
still be human. Turturro plays the tragic role with an understandable
quietude (his voice barely rises above a whisper) and with an emotional
understatement, conveying a deep sadness in his gestures and deep
reflections, showing how difficult it is for him to see the light of day
again without feeling atrophied and lost. He is the reason for any
success the film has. Unfortunately, the rest of the film, as worthy an
effort as it is, about a subject matter that merits to be told again and
again, as its Holocaust tale can't be told enough to the world for its
message to sink in and should be told in a multitude of ways;
nevertheless, as compelling as the film was at times, it also shot
itself in the foot by trying to tell a conventional story while the more
powerful and personal tale of Primo Levi was somewhat sacrificed by
these very typical Hollywood episodic scenes of how the other characters
reacted to their liberation and with Rosi's added attempt to attain some
comic relief from these diverse characters being poorly accomplished.
He, thusly, diminished the power of the concentration camp story. The
meditations of Primo Levi and soberness of the story were the thing to
shoot for here, and all one has to do is read Primo's book and see how
much more gripping those images were there when read than the screen
images that tended to be tedious and somewhat diverting after awhile.</P>
<P>The film significantly begins as mounted Soviet cavalrymen appear on a
hill outside of the camp, where the buildings are left burning from the
battle just fought, as the fleeing SS guards leave the bewildered
Holocaust prisoners behind, who are left looking up in awe at their
liberators.</P>
<P>When in Cracow, waiting to get a train home while placed in the transit
camps by the Russians, Primo is allowed to wander in and out of the camp
and he meets in town a hustler and pleasure-seeker, known by the
sobriquet of 'The Greek (Rade),' who steers the frightened and unworldly
Italian youngster to places of food, and gets him to carry his heavy
duffel bag and sell clothes for him as payment for his expertise in
getting along. The Greek soon abandons him, admonishing him for being
hopeless, as he leaves him with this advise: "Before you can forage for
food, you need shoes on your feet."  Primo is left with a strange sort
of respect and admiration for him, while also resenting him for leaving
him in such a manner.</P>
<P>The Russians are portrayed in a somewhat enigmatic light, positive for
their role as liberators and providers of food and shelter, but are also
ridiculed for their rigid ways and for being a nation that is used to
slavery as a normal way of life and thinks nothing of the misery of
others; but, who for the most part, at least, in this film, they are
shown to have no bias against the survivors for being Jews. There is
only one incident where the Poles in a marketplace, shun away from Primo
because he is a Jew from Auschwitz, that is when he is trying to sell
them a shirt.</P>
<P>The Russians continally round the survivors up cattle-like and put them
on trucks without telling them what is going on, but the survivors feel
relieved when the Russians are sent to the front and they are left in
the transit camps only with the civilians. The survivors just can't wait
for the war to be over and for them to get on the train and go home.
Luckily for Primo, he gets to work in a hospital as a doctor (labeling
the medicines) and when there, he develops a crush on a luscious blonde
nurse (Wagner), but is too tongue-tied to tell this sometime prostitute
with a heart of gold how he feels about her.</P>
<P>Music is the universal language of healing, and when the Russians put on
a musical show for their victory celebration, with one of their soldiers
militarily dancing like Fred Astaire to the Irving Berlin tune 'Cheek to
Cheek,' it brings joy to the survivors en masse, as they begin to dance
with each other.</P>
<P>Primo, in proud defiance, wears his concentration camp coat with the
Jewish star on it, as if it was a badge of honor, wanting to show others
who he is and let them sort out for themselves what to think of him. He
becomes an onlooker, observing the destruction left in the wake of the
Nazi terror through-out Europe, as the train is finally there for them
and it follows the map shown on screen, across Poland and Russia and
when derailed, the refugees trod on by foot until they catch another
train, as it heads back down through Austria and Germany before Primo
returns at last to Turin.</P>
<P>A tubercular camp survivor (Dionisi), who is guilt-ridden why he
survived and his family and friends got wiped out by the Nazis in
Venice, feels relieved to toss the starving German slave-prisoners he
sees on the road a piece of bread, as these members of the 'Master Race'
grovel at his feet for it.</P>
<P>Primo meets up with 'The Greek' again, while he is passing through
Russia. 'The Greek' somehow is running a bordello there. In Austria an
old lady who wrote a letter to Hitler to end the war, but the SS
responded by burning her house to the ground and her husband left her,
gives him time to reflect on what the outside world is like, as she
offers him and his friend Cesare (Massimo) some drinks and food. Cesare
keeps reminding Primo, don't be so glum, it is laughter that is the cure
all for this misery we have undergone.</P>
<P>In a very sensitive scene, he meets a guilt-ridden woman camp survivor,
who did God knows what to survive in the camp, who Primo has a brief
affair with and becomes human again.</P>
<P>Perhaps, the most moving scene in the film or the phoniest (which is my
take on it), take your choice, is his return to Germany, where he makes
eye contact with a Nazi soldier in the Munich train station, but the
haughty soldier does not know why he is being stared at, but then Primo
opens up his concentration camp jacket and the soldier sees the Jewish
yellow star and without a word being said on either side, he bows down
as if asking forgiveness. But for the ungodly, non-religious, and
non-Communist Primo, who was arrested as a Partisan freedom fighter and
not because he was a Jew (he concedes that before the war he wasn't even
aware of being Jewish), it is not forgiveness that he wishes to grant
but that the Holocaust be something that is viewed as so horrible an
event that it won't ever be forgotten by mankind. For Primo Levi, "God
cannot exist if Auschwitz exists."</P>
<P>As for the film's title, Rosi explained, "Life is a truce between the
moment we're born and the moment we die." This holds true with Primo
Levi's belief that war is continuous. The spiritual awakening for Levi
is what came about on his circuitous route home, where he found a reason
to live again.</P>
<P>The Truce ends on a near-note of normalcy, in which one finds Primo back
at home by his desk, as if this nightmare never happened. But in his
last look at us, we realize that he can't ever return to the way things
were before, the price of survival has too high of a price tag on it for
him to believe in normalcy again.</P>
<P>I just couldn't help feeling that this earnest attempt at capturing the
mood of that horrific event, lacked whatever it takes to make this a
first-rate film. The story was there from Primo Levi's book, the right
actor played him, but most of the other decisions Rosi made in the
filming of the story, failed to bring it to life and make it convincing.</P>
