<PRE>                        MULHOLLAND DRIVE
               (a film review by Mark R. Leeper)</PRE>
<PRE>    CAPSULE: David Lynch writes and directs a different sort of 
    movie for him.  This is a mystery with a very tricky set of 
    plot twists.  I interpret this film as an attempt to taunt 
    and play with the genre and its fans.  This is a film that 
    has people getting together to discuss what it all means 
    when it is over.  Still overall I cannot recommend the film.  
    Rating: 4 (0 to 10), low 0 (-4 to +4) Heavy Spoiler: This 
    review will not reveal any plot twists but will be followed 
    by a spoiler section that will discuss the subtle point of 
    the film and the idea of the film is not obvious until the 
    end. </PRE>
<P>MULHOLLAND DRIVE did very well at the Cannes Film Festival.  As 
you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the 
Toronto International Film Festival.  It may not be clear to the 
viewer why I am so negative on this film for most of the running 
time.  In fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the 
backdrop of the Hollywood film industry.  Toward the end of the 
film I think everything that has been built falls apart.  The film 
was to be a pilot for a TV series but writer and director David 
Lynch did not sell his TV pilot and I think he decided that he 
wanted to do something else with it.  Something else is what he 
did. </P>
<P>The film opens with a woman (played by Laura Harring) about to be 
killed in a car when a car crash saves her life.  She crawls away 
from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow 
with an unlocked door to sleep.  Meanwhile young vivacious Betty 
(Naomi Watts) arrives in Hollywood from Canada.  She wants to 
build a career as an actress.  Betty is a little surprised to find 
a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow.  She does not know who 
the woman is.  She is even more surprised when the woman awakes 
and does not herself know who she is.  They fix on a name Rita for 
her, but are not sure if this right or not. </P>
<P>Meanwhile local director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has problems 
of his own.  He is trying to cast one actress for his new film and 
is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to 
cast someone else, Cammie Rhodes (Melissa George).  These two 
threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and 
comic murder that goes terribly wrong.  There is also a strange 
character called The Cowboy (Monty Montgomery) adding to the 
confusion. </P>
<P>In what was probably intended for the television pilot the film 
opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the 
credits.  A lot of MULHOLLAND DRIVE starts out fun.  Lynch wants 
you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film.  He just 
chooses not to.  As with any David Lynch film there is strange 
material added for little reason.  There are no earthworms, but 
there are some decidedly strange David Lynch touches.  The film is 
a little long for the subject matter.  Toward the end it gets into 
some heavier violence and sex scenes, clearly not intended for the 
TV pilot. </P>
<P>Unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about 
this film would be spoilers.  I will not mention them in the main 
body of the review but I give MULHOLLAND DRIVE a 4 on the 0 to 10 
scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale. </P>
<P>MULHOLLAND DRIVE Spoiler Warning.  I have rated this film fairly 
low.  You should read this only after seeing the film or deciding 
that you will not see the film. </P>
<P>David Lynch is in large part a dark satirist.  Most of his work is 
done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside.  In 
MULHOLLAND DRIVE I think he is having a laugh at the expense of 
the crime film genre.  What he does with this film is (Are you 
sure you want to read this?) playing off the audience expectations 
that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on.  The 
first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story 
with clues sprinkled throughout.  Then suddenly at the end he 
turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that 
appear that they should add up to something.  The audience 
expectation is that they will add up.  But he has given clues that 
are self-contradictory.  Lynch wants the audience to argue about 
what they have seen afterward and come up with theories.  In fact, 
the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until I hear a 
better explanation, I think Lynch is merely playing a joke. </P>
<P>There is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties.  Mad 
Magazine called it a Poiuyt.  Other sources called it a Tri-
pronged U-bar.  Look at small portions of it and makes sense.  
Look at the whole figure and it does not.  This film is, in my 
estimation, the cinematic equivalent of a Tri-pronged U-bar. </P>
