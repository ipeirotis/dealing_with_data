<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A mild thriller that has the glossy atmospheric look of a riveting
horror film but not the impactful story to pull off this foolish
sadistic killer tale in a reasonable manner, which results in one of the
stupidest endings imaginable. It is a film that is done in the genre's
formula mold, laying on all those mindless gory contrivances that horror
fans have seen before, it is also a tale that has more holes in it than
a New York City junkie.</P>
<P>For entertainment value, the movie forces the audience to look at how
the police collect gruesome evidence at a crime scene, as an
inexperienced policewoman, the former model, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina
Jolie), assists a quadriplegic author and brilliant forensic expert,
Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington), in tracking down a serial killer who
leaves arcane clues for them, as they are led around to New York City's
underground sites, such as turn-of-the-century slaughterhouses and
discarded subway stations. Her job is to be the first at the crime scene
to insure that the evidence isn't trampled by the incompetent police and
the 'pig' who is the police captain (Rooker). She talks with Rhyme by
cell phone, as he leads her through the procedures of collectiving the
evidence at the crime scene, with her bravely going into the dark
passages to locate the victims, where the only light is from her
flashlight.</P>
<P>The catch to this detective film being, that Rhyme can't get out of bed,
that he controls his breathing tube, computer and TV from one click of
his remote-control mouse, yet you know by the conclusion he will get the
demented killer by outsmarting him. She is around to do all the physical
work at the crime scene and to supply the film with a contrasting
character who has a similar emotional problem: both are heroic and have
to overcome something in the past that is blocking them -- in her case,
the memory of her policeman father's suicide.</P>
<P>There is a twinkling of romance in their eyes, but he can't do anything
about it because of his physical condition. The climactic romantic scene
has Amelia caressing his index finger -- which goes for love in this
film. Four years ago, while working a police case, he became crippled
after a beam fell atop him while going down a shaft. He now suffers from
seizures, has a full-time nurse (Latifah) taking care of him, and is
concerned that any of these seizures could reduce him to a vegetable, in
which case he plans to end his life rather than to live that way. We see
him in close-up shots showing off his pearly white teeth while profusely
smiling, acting petulant, displaying a genius for uncovering clues,
while she looks at him with bouts of stubborness in between bouts of
idylic sensual joy. The best part of the movie was the chemistry between
the two. It's just too bad that the film was so manipulative,
dull-witted, spewing bad dialogue as easily as steam that oozes out of a
broken steam pipe, as the whole venture just seemed absurd.</P>
<P>The first murder victim is Mr. Rubin. His hand was found sticking out
from the ground by the train tracks, as the beat cop Amelia was the
first to arrive at the crime scene and did such a marvelous job
collecting evidence, that her reward is to work with the master
criminologist Rhyme, who works out of his home. The second victim is
Mrs. Rubin, who was found later in a different location, scalded to
death while in handcuffs.</P>
<P>When Amelia meets Rhyme for the first time, she says in a self-effacing
manner that she learned what to do at the crime scene by reading his
forensic text while at the Police Academy. Not wanting to be pulled from
her new promotion to work with juveniles on a desk job, she tells him
she wants out. He tells her some dribble about destiny, that destiny is
what you make it -- if it's a gift you have for forensics, don't blow
it. This dialogue is B movie material stuff, and that the stars talk
this talk throughout the film, is a credit to them that they do it with
straight faces. Their faces have star quality written all over it and
even though this role doesn't determine if she can act or not, it does
show that her face, like his, shines like a star, as the movie camera is
very kind to the two of them.</P>
<P>The killer is disguised as a taxi driver, who picks up his victims at
the airport or Grand Central Terminal, locks them in his car and speeds
off into the thin air. There are a series of these killings besides the
Rubins: an N.Y.U. student gets picked up for his cab ride to heaven and
gets devoured by rats, and a father and daughter also go for a deadly
taxi ride, but this time Amelia is getting good at reading the clues,
and she gets to save the girl submerged in the East River before it is
too late.</P>
<P>The film builds up to its hokey conclusion by firstly misleading the
audience who the killer is, then it has the killer confront and attack
Rhyme in a campy way, even biting him like a vampire in the neck. Its
appeal might be that it is so absurd, so lacking in tension and quality
filmmaking, that one might be lulled into its state of languor and
accept it for what it is: another horror movie in a long line of such
films that should be a staple at the drive-in or as a movie rental for
insomniacs who choose not to rent porno to get their cheap thrills.</P>
