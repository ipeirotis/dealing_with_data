<P>     Conventional wisdom suggests that Walt Disney Pictures produces 
some of the best available animated films and some of the worst 
available live-action films.  101 DALMATIANS, a shamelessly sickening 
example of on-screen marketing, is neck-and-neck with SPACE JAM for the 
most obvious, feature-length commercial of the 1996 holiday season.  The 
difference is, for all its attempts to hawk merchandise, SPACE JAM still 
manages to be sporadically entertaining.  101 DALMATIANS, on the other 
hand, is a one-hundred-plus minute bore.  Even children, who will be 
enthralled by all the puppies, may have a hard time not fidgeting for 
protracted portions of the running time.</P>
<P>     With a script by John Hughes, it's no surprise that parts of this 
movie play like HOME ALONE.  Unfortunately, we've been exposed to this 
brand of nasty, moronic physical humor ad nauseum in the past half-dozen 
years, primarily through a never-ending series of HOME ALONE sequels, 
clones, and rip-offs (most produced by Hughes himself).  It's not 
remotely funny here.  See Jeff Daniels slam his bicycle into a park 
bench and go flying into a lake.  See two bad guys get zapped by an 
electrical fence.  See Glenn Close take a bath in marmalade.  Ha-ha-ha.</P>
<P>     The first 101 DALMATIANS, produced by Disney in 1961, is not one of 
my favorite animated classics, but its brand of charm and humor are 
completely lost in this version.  Back then, the dogs talked, and their 
dialogue made the film.  Here, the four-legged protagonists are 
completely without voice, and, consequently, without personality.  
Virtually half this movie lacks dialogue (unless you count occasional 
yaps by the dogs and quips by the bad guys as "dialogue"), and, with 
nothing to fill the void, 101 DALMATIANS turns out to be a stale, 
lifeless movie-going experience.  I felt like going to sleep and asking 
someone to wake me for the closing credits (which feature a jazzed-up 
rendition of the song, "Cruella DeVil", from the original).</P>
<P>     The villain of the piece, Cruella DeVil, has long been one of 
Disney's nastiest baddies, and Glenn Close seems the perfect choice for 
the role.  Sadly, although Close does her over-the-top best, Cruella 
doesn't really work.  In one of its few sly observations, the script 
notes that for a villain to be successful, the viewer's feelings for 
him/her have to go well beyond hatred.  We don't feel much for Cruella, 
and certainly not anything as passionate as the desire to see her 
annihilated (unless such an occurrence shortened the film).</P>
<P>     The story -- or rather what passes for a story -- takes place in 
contemporary England, and features some wonderful set design (101 
DALMATIANS' sole redeeming grace).  It tells of how, through the 
connivance of two Dalmatian, a computer game designer, Roger (Jeff 
Daniels), meets a fashion designer, Anita (Joely Richardson), one day in 
the park.  They fall in love and get married.  Anita's Dalmatian, Perdy, 
and Roger's dog, Pongo, follow suit, and soon, puppies are on the way.  
But all is not well.  Cruella DeVil, Anita's boss and a lover of real 
fur coats, has decided that she wants something with spots.  When Roger 
and Anita refuse her generous financial offer for the little dogs, she 
tries nefarious means, sending a pair of paid thugs (Hugh Laurie and 
Mark Williams) out to do some dog-napping.  In short order, not only do 
they have Perdy and Pongo's fifteen puppies in custody, but 84 others, 
as well. (99 + Perdy + Pongo = 101, if you feel obligated to do the 
arithmetic.)</P>
<P>     There's not enough human characterization in this film to fill a 
thimble.  Jeff Daniels (FLY AWAY HOME) and Joely Richardson (I'LL DO 
ANYTHING) seem almost superfluous, creating personalities that are as 
richly-textured as cardboard.  The crooks are generic -- if you lose 
track of which movie you're watching, you can be forgiven for confusing 
Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams with Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, the inept 
burglars from the HOME ALONE series.  And Joan Plowright, who plays 
Roger and Anita's housekeeper, is nearly invisible.  </P>
<P>     This is a despicable motion picture.  Not only is it completely 
unnecessary (the animated version is perfectly adequate), but it's a 
blatant example of Disney's commercialism run rampant.  Simply and 
succinctly put, 101 DALMATIANS has one overriding aim:  to sucker 
parents into buying spotted paraphernalia for their children.  Worse 
still, thousands of real Dalmatian puppies purchased in pet stores this 
year will end up being destroyed by animal shelters when their new 
owners tire of, then discard, them.  The movie is bad, but the mentality 
behind it is worse, and, for that reason, 101 DALMATIANS belongs in the 
dog house.</P>
