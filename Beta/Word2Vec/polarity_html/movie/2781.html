<P>     Jim Broadbent is sort of the British film industry's guarantee.
Every movie in which he has appeared can boast a certain level of
quality, irrespective of whether Broadbent plays the lead (as in LIFE
IS SWEET or the wickedly funny Mike Leigh short "A Sense of History")
or has a supporting role (ENCHANTED APRIL, THE CRYING GAME, WIDOWS'
PEAK).  Thus, it's no surprise that THE WEDDING GIFT (which was shown
as WIDE-EYED AND LEGLESS overseas) transcends its sappy script.
Broadbent may not be able to turn this movie into an instant classic,
but he keeps it watchable.</P>
<P>     THE WEDDING GIFT utilizes the worn-out theme of "the unknown
disease."  Occasionally, this topic can be crafted into a rare and
powerful film, such as 1992's LORENZO'S OIL.  Most of the time,
however, these kinds of stories are relegated to TV movies, a fare
which too- rarely claims impressive performers or intelligent writing.</P>
<P>     Whereas the cast of THE WEDDING GIFT is top-notch, the screenplay
is not.  Aside from the delightfully witty banter between Diana (Julie
Walters) and Deric (Broadbent), there's little to distinguish this
script.  Its moments of genuine emotion are rare (I can think of two
offhand, one of which occurs during the final scene), and it too often
descends into melodrama.  There are also a number of sub-themes, such
as the right of a sick person to take their own life, that, after being
introduced, are subsequently ignored.</P>
<P>     The disease in question is as debilitating as it is
undiagnosable.  Despite repeated trips to different hospitals, and
examinations by an army of consultants, no one can figure out what's
wrong with Diana.  Finally, having exhausted their complete battery of
tests, the doctors arrive at the dubious conclusion that the blackouts,
twisted hands, and weakened legs are all the result of hysteria.  Diana
won't buy that, and neither will her husband Deric.</P>
<P>     As Diana's condition worsens, she begins to contemplate her own
death, and what it will do to her husband, whose future happiness she
wishes to assure.  To that end, she arranges for Deric to fall in love
with Aileen Armitage (Sian Thomas), an attractive, blind author that he
encountered at a writer's conference.  Diana and Aileen secretly meet
and, in the process of getting to know one another, form an unusual
bond.</P>
<P>     This rather unoriginal material, which is "based on a true story,"
is given a tremendous lift by its performers.  Broadbent brings the
right mix of concern and nervous humor to Deric.  Julie Walters is his
perfect match, doing an excellent job of conveying both the physical
and psychological pain caused by Diana's condition.  Thora Birch is
hilarious as Deric's senile mother, easily pilfering every scene she's
in.  The rest of the cast, while perhaps not as visible, is just as
solid.</P>
<P>     One of the keys to THE WEDDING GIFT's working on any level is the
willingness of the audience to accept that Diana and Deric are
genuinely in love (not the kind of romantic love portrayed in most
films, but a deeper, more lasting emotion).  While the script doesn't
do a whole lot to get this across, Broadbent and Walters force the
issue through their performances, with a look here and a touch there.
A glimpse of Deric's worried features conveys more than any line of
dialogue.</P>
<P>     Watching what the actors do with their roles in THE WEDDING GIFT
is the film's greatest asset.  Enduring its attempts to twist emotions
and wring tears from our eyes is its greatest detriment.  A movie needs
to be very good to get away with such obvious manipulation and, despite
having its share of moments, THE WEDDING GIFT isn't strong enough--as
almost everyone (except those who love to cry) is likely to recognize.</P>
