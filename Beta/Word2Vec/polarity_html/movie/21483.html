<P>     I came to an epiphany while watching THE BACHELOR, an
innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy. It's not the sort of film
in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity, but there it
was nonetheless. I sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold
when suddenly I realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire
romantic comedy genre circa 1999. In a word, it's the same thing that's
wrong with so many movies circa 1999: writing. More to the point, it's the
refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a
story about a relationship. THE BACHELOR is merely the latest in a long
line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of
attractive, pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant.</P>
<P>     In this particular case, Attractive and Pleasant Exhibit A is Jimmy
Shannon (Chris O'Donnell), a single guy who has been watching his friends
slowly but surely sucked into marriage. It's a scary notion for Jimmy,
even though he dearly loves Attractive and Pleasant Exhibit B Anne (Renee
Zellweger), his girlfriend of three years. Convinced despite his
reservations that it's time to "sh*t or get off the pot," Jimmy proposes
to Anne -- very badly. Anne refuses, which leaves Jimmy in a very odd
position when his eccentric grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies and leaves a
very specific video will. Jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is
married by 6:05 p.m. on his 30th birthday, stays married for 10 years and
produces a child. There are only a couple of minor problems: 1) Jimmy's
30th birthday is the next day; 2) Anne is nowhere to be found, meaning
Jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many
ex-girlfriends.</P>
<P>     It's a wacky, BREWSTER'S MILLIONS-esque premise (acknowledged as such
in one of the film's better, more self-aware lines of dialogue), the kind
where a shallow and materialistic guy learns What Really Matters. At least
that would be the case if Jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist.
Screenwriter Steve Cohen slides into the story an even more draconian
condition in the will: If Jimmy doesn't get married, not only will he lose
all the money, but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out
from under him, costing hudreds of jobs. From the outset, Jimmy's
motivation isn't cash; it's the livelihoods of his devoted employees. It's
almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in THE
BACHELOR's plot development. By any human standard, the guy is impossibly
selfless.</P>
<P>     And that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like THE
BACHELOR -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their
way to happiness. There's never any tension between the two star-crossed
lovers, because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at
stake. The blandly nice O'Donnell couldn't pull off a randy cad if he
tried, so the filmmakers don't even let him; Zellweger's Anne may have
issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard
to live up to, but no one dares make her anything but the woman (lightly)
wronged. And forget about seeing enough of Jimmy and Anne together to feel
invested in their potential reconciliation. The parade of sit-com set
pieces had better be damned funny, since they're all that stands between
us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion.</P>
<P>     I'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing, including
Ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting
with men popping questions and champagne corks. Far more of them are
either tedious or downright ghastly, like the shudder-inducing sight of
Brooke Shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of
stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church. You're
never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like THE
BACHELOR, but that's not the real problem. Nor is it the real problem that
you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to.
The problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy --
there's no spark, no energy, no humanity. It's an emotional pudding
guaranteed not to offend any consumer's digestions. We've reached a point
where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don't even have
a pulse. THE BACHELOR is love among the mannequins.</P>
