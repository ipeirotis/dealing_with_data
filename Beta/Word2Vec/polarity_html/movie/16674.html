<P>     Twenty-five years ago, Paul Newman would have played Garret Blake,
the grieving, laconic hero of Nicholas Sparks' best-selling novel MESSAGE
IN A BOTTLE.  He would have brought the ideal combination of elements to
the role of a shipbuilder whose sea-borne messages to his dead wife are
found by Chicago newspaper researcher Theresa Osborne (Robin Wright Penn),
compelling her to seek out the author of the sensitive missives.  You can
imagine Newman both as a man's man -- a loner dedicated to his craft --
and a ladies' man -- deeply sensitive when touched by the love of a good
woman.  That's the kind of screen presence you need when you're dealing
with one of these mythically appealing romances like THE BRIDGES OF
MADISON COUNTY or THE HORSE WHISPERER.  You need a Clint Eastwood, or a
Robert Redford...or a Paul Newman.</P>
<P>     In 1998, you get Paul Newman playing Garret's father Dodge, and as
Garret you get...Kevin Costner.  Costner has always been at his best in
roles where her could be easygoing (SILVERADO, BULL DURHAM, TIN CUP), 
while his attempts at playing icons (THE UNTOUCHABLES, WATERWORLD, THE
POSTMAN) could be most charitably described as uneven.  Yet here he is in
MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, playing the emotionally unavailable but romantically
irresistable Garret.  He's the kind of guy who loves too deeply, whose
gestures of self-sacrifice are the stuff of song and story.  It's Costner
once again as the paradigm, the icon, and I for one didn't believe him for
a second.</P>
<P>     To be fair, Costner isn't the only thing wrong with MESSAGE IN A
BOTTLE.  Director Luis Mandoki's adaptation is a technically glorious
piece of work -- beautifully photographed by Caleb Deschanel, sweepingly
scored by Gabriel Yared -- but it's one heck of a long sit, clocking in at
a soggy two hours and fifteen minutes.  The storyline parallels Theresa's
emergence from emotional isolation after a difficult divorce with Garret's
difficulties letting go of his wife, and does so in fetishistic detail.
There's a subplot involving Garret's conflict with his embittered in-laws,
and the occasional tete-a-tete between Dodge and Garret or between Dodge
and Theresa, all building with a gruelling lack of tension to one big
cathartic payoff.  You may leave the theater with your hanky wet, but it
could be from the drool that collects while you nod off to sleep just as
easily as from tears.</P>
<P>     Lost at sea along the way are extremely effective performances by
Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman.  Wright Penn is an actress we don't see
very much, which allows her still to be an actress in a role like this
rather than a movie star.  Her conflicted pursuit of Garret -- a man whose
letters should have told her from the start isn't ready to love anyone
else -- is convincing in context; her moments of insecurity and
disappointment are genuinely affecting.  Newman, meanwhile, gets to be
gruff in a way that usually turns actors into hams, but turns this veteran
into a breath of fresh air.  He's so effortlessly charming, it's easy to
forget the Harlequin sensibility at the heart of MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE and
begin enjoying it as human relationship drama.</P>
<P>     Costner, too, can be effortlessly charming, but not here.  His
interpretation of the role is so focused on Garret's internalized mourning
that in the moments when he's supposed to be letting go with Theresa, he
looks like a man trying to act like a grieving man trying to be
effortlessly charming.  If that reads awkwardly, it plays even more
awkwardly, with Costner straining for Meaning and Significance in every
scene while his leading lady acts circles around him.  MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE
undoubtedly will have its sob appeal, just as the novel did.  Unlike the
film adaptations of THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY and THE HORSE WHISPERER,
that's the main thing this one has going for it.  It's too bad it couldn't
have been made twenty-five years ago, when Paul Newman hadn't yet handed
over the iconic roles to actors ill-suited to handling them.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 empty bottles:  5.</PRE>
