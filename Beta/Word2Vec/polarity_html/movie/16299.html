<P>The most interesting thing about Virus is that the title of the film
does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our
heroes.  Alas, it refers to our heroes!  As it turns out, the alien race
that sends a computer virus to earth (via the Mir space station) thinks
of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to
be eradicated before it spreads any further.  After all, we have taken
up this entire planet, and if they let us live for another billion years
or so, we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one.</P>
<P>But the human race doesn't have much to worry about.  After all,
there's a woman named Foster (Jamie Lee Curtis) out there stopping the
computer virus.  She's the chief navigator on a sea vessel; travelling
with her is Captain Everton (Donald Sutherland), Steve Baker (William
Baldwin), Woods (Marshall Bell), Squeaky (Julio Oscar Mechoso), and
Richie (Sherman Augustus).  They're all sailing in a typhoon one lovely
evening when they stumble across an enormous, abandoned Russian
satellite ship in international waters.  Lucky for us, we already saw
that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone
on board.</P>
<P>The evil Captain Everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get
a reward; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money, so
they try to salvage the ship.  Soon, however, when it's apparent that no
one is on board and that the ship has no power, they realize that
something bad must have happened.  Finally, they meet Nadia (Joanna
Pacula) who explains their situation:  a computer virus has taken over
the ship!  It's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the
human race!</P>
<P>Virus is a truly dumb action thriller, one of negligible intelligence
and innovation.  When considering the entire film, you will realize that
it lacks a single original scene.  It's a direct rip-off of nearly every
James Cameron film (Aliens, The Abyss, and the Terminator films are the
most plagiarized); more importantly, it's basically the same movie as
last year's Deep Rising.  I liked Deep Rising simply because it's funny
-- it knows it's silly and derivative.  Virus takes itself seriously. 
And, in the most serious manner possible, it steals from every good and
bad film of the genre, showing you countless familiar scenes, and
sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre
could fit with a little trimming.</P>
<P>But what is so amazing about Virus is how poorly the whole thing has
been thought out.  Okay, let me get this straight -- the alien race
(which is never really explained) is basically sentient electricity. 
They need to make themselves physical, so they use a space station to
get onto a ship (which is surrounded by water, but who cares about
that).  On the ship, they make a bunch of clunky, immobile robots that
somehow kill three hundred people.  After that, they start using the
dead people to create half-human, half-machine creatures that look like
the Terminator but are much worse at walking around.  </P>
<P>The leader, of course, is a big creature.  Every film like this has a
big creature at the end, but the big creature in Virus is so big that it
has to tear down the walls to move around.  Virus is indeed a cliched
film, but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just
isn't very threatening.  It's established that they can simply turn off
the power to stop it, but the virus has sealed the power room by the
time our heroes get there.  </P>
<P>On one level, Virus is almost passable fun.  It's really gory, and a
few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal (the director, John
Bruno, worked on a lot of Cameron's films).  There's also a nice array
of actors, even though none of them do any acting (except for Donald
Sutherland, who does a lot of very bad acting).  The bottom line,
however, is this:  Virus is a bad movie.  It rips off a lot of good
movies that are worth seeing.  In that order, I recommend that you rent
any one of the Alien films, simply to admire the qualities of a creature
that actually threatens our heroes.</P>
