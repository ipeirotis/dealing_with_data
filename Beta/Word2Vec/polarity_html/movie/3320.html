                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>

Director:  Danny Boyle.</PRE>
<P>     Quentin Tarantino may prove to have a more profound effect on
the immediate future of cinema than any other single individual.
It's not just that other new filmmakers will be mimicking his style,
though such recent fare as LOVE AND A .45 shows that he is already
having an influence in that respect.  No, Tarantino's most important
legacy may be that films which until only recently would have seemed
doomed to obscurity are finding enthusiastic distribution because
the audience has spoken:  dark, funny and twisted is *in*.  The
first beneficiary of the Tarantino Effect might be the British
import SHALLOW GRAVE, a macabre little thriller with some shaky
characterizations but a great look and feel.</P>
<P>     SHALLOW GRAVE is the story of three friends sharing a flat in
Glasgow:  Juliet (Kerry Fox), a doctor with a penchant for avoiding
her suitors; Alex (Ewan McGregor), a cocky journalist; and David
(Christopher Eccleston), a quiet accountant.  Their search for a
fourth flatmate brings Hugo (Keith Allen), a secretive fellow who
claims to be a writer.  However, when the three friends find Hugo
dead in his room one day of apparent heart failure, they discover at
least one thing he failed to mention:  a suitcase full of money.
Rather than report the death, they decide to keep the money and
dispose of the body.  But as Hugo's "business associates" begin to
come around and the police begin to get suspicious, the friendship
proves considerably less than stable, as each one begins to become
distrustful and to plot ways to get hold of the cash.</P>
<P>     Thrillers like SHALLOW GRAVE depend on tight plotting, tense
situations and atmosphere, and it hits about two out of three.  The
point behind disposing of the body is somewhat lost on me, since
they could have reported the death without reporting the money, and
a few late developments are glossed over so quickly that it's easy
for the audience to wonder exactly what happened when.  But it is
mostly in retrospect that these problems appear, because SHALLOW
GRAVE is a pretty intense piece of work.  A pair of interviews with
a police detective are extremely effective, as you begin to watch
the roommates' resolve crumble, and Danny Boyle's direction
highlights a marvelous set, the massive flat shared by Juliet, David
and Alex.  The lighting, the bold colors and the seemingly endless
hiding places create a mounting paranoia that sweeps you in even as
it sweeps in the characters.</P>
<P>     Yet for all its tension and eventual excursions into viscera,
SHALLOW GRAVE is essentially a character piece that examines how the
fragile relationships between these three individuals are shattered
by their shared secret.  Christopher Eccleston has the meatiest
part, a boring man who is changed forever by his role in the crime.
Determined not to let his actions be for nothing, he retreats into
the attic with the money, and becomes the most hardened of the
three.  Unfortunately, the other two leads are not nearly as well
developed.  Kerry Fox is savvy and manipulative as Juliet, but there
is something missing, a bit too much left unsaid, particularly her
refusal to deal with the men who call for her or approach her at
social functions.  Ewan McGregor's Alex has the best quips, and his
bluster early in the film (especially during the opening montage
where the friends grill applicants for the room) gives way to a
convincing fear as he realizes the he has gotten in way over his
head, but he too isn't given quite enough background.  While the
story could have been about how their mutual participation in this
event changes all three, it ends up that David is the only one whose
state of mind is examined in any depth.</P>
<P>     Still, SHALLOW GRAVE works fundamentally because it keeps the
pressure on.  It is always only a matter of time before a "perfect
crime" is revealed in its imperfection, and the multiple double-
crosses are fun to watch.  Though SHALLOW GRAVE could have been
tighter and more psychological, Eccleston's intense performance and
a few nasty little twists make it a thriller that keeps you
watching, guessing and squirming.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 partners in crime:  7.</PRE>
