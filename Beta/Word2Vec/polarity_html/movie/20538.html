<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An uninspiring film about a muse (Sharon Stone) in Hollywood helping a
writer (Albert Brooks ) who was stuck without a good idea for a script.
This is a dull, unfunny film, lacking an edge to it, as if the
screenwriter is past his prime and maybe should take a year off to
re-gain his touch.</P>
<P>Albert Brooks' (Modern Romance, Defending Your Life, Mother) latest film
deals with his critique of Hollywood's taste, as it results in Brooks
turning out the same kind of film he is railing against. This sitcom
film is actually worst than most sitcoms seen on TV; it should have come
with canned laughter. In the theater I saw it, no one laughed; and,
watching a comedy without hearing any laughs gives me a creepy feeling.
The film lacked the kind of comedy expected for a satire. Even if the
story never took off, I at least expected the film to have some snappy
things to say about those who are part of the Hollywood establishment
and not to mirror it so closely with the Hollywood scene that it can't
even be considered a parody anymore. I thought Brooks mailed this script
in. All the cameo performances-Rob Reiner, Cybill Shepherd, Martin
Scorsese, James Cameron, Lorenzo Lamas, Wolfgang Puck, and Jennifer
Tilly- were for no avail, they added nothing to the story.</P>
<P>It was hard to think of Brooks as a victim of Hollywood when he was
surrounded by so much wealth and the only thing he strove for was to
become even wealthier. He never asked the muse to inspire him to write a
great classic, only for some "summer script" he can sell to the studios
as a blockbuster movie. If he was trying for a parody (which I assume he
was), he just didn't succeed. All he succeeded in showing was that there
is some bitterness in him and that he's part of the "fat cats" who make
up the Hollywood scene, too complacent to make a real satire with some
bite in it. The affluent Hollywood milieu of the film took away any
chance but for us to see him fit right into the upscale lifestyle of
those who frequent the tennis courts, swimming pools, and live in those
mansions with guest houses. But I think the main problem with the film,
besides the fact that it's a one idea film, is how that idea was weak
and never developed.The Brooks character never spelled out why he was so
desperate in the first place and he never showed us how good a writer he
was. It was difficult to see what was his problem, especially when he
has a lovely wife (Andie MacDowell) whom he loves and two sweet
daughters, a splendid home, drives a Mercedes, is an established
Hollywood writer after 17 years in the business, has good contacts
there, and is rich.</P>
<P>I feel I must question the film's intent: Why should I feel sorry for
Brooks? What is this edge that he is supposed to have lost? Where is the
comedy in the film? What is this nonsense about getting a live muse
supposed to mean? What kind of statement is he making about creativity?
Should I really believe that someone would have the chutzpah to make a
film about a screenwriter who lost his touch and pays for a muse so he
can get that touch back and makes a film that is so flat and uninspired?
Is he trying to tell me that people in Hollywood will believe in
anything and so should I?</P>
<P>The Muse opens with Brooks winning a Humanitarian Award. His daughter
asks him, "what is a humanitarian?" And he responds, "It's someone who's
never won the Oscar." And there you have the funniest line in the film
and it comes right in the beginning of the film. After a meeting with a
studio executive (Feuerstein), who tells him his script is no good,
Brooks then turns to his successful writer friend, Jeff Bridges, who
suggests he contacts the same muse who helped him. A muse being any one
of the nine mythological Greek daughters of Zeus who are divine sources
of inspiration, but in this case it is the mentally unstable Sharon
Stone.</P>
<P>What goes for comedy in this film, has to do with his whiny relationship
to the muse. The muse is demanding gifts from Tiffany's from him and
must be placed in an expensive hotel suite, later on she will occupy the
bedroom of his house, with him forced to sleep in the guest house. He
also must run errands for her and cater to all her whims. She in return
helps him out by suggesting he go to the aquarium in Long Beach and find
something there to use for an idea. That dumbness prevails, and he comes
up with a lame idea for a film in which he wants to have Jim Carrey star
in, is supposed to be his way of saying that Hollywood doesn't know
what's good from what's crap, or doesn't care. His wife will also be
inspired by the muse, she will go successfully into the cookie business,
a source of some more whining comedy on his part. This is "I LOVE LUCY"
kind of humor.</P>
<P>That this film is about making money being tantamount in Hollywood to
creativity, is a theme that has been often done and this film has not
touched on any new ground with that concept. If you make a satire, it
better be funny, or if it is a more serious film, it should try to have
a script with some characters who are profound and perceptive. To have a
satire with nothing to dig into is unfortunate, as Brooks chose to go
for his laughs by having his character be a whiner, grousing about the
demands of his muse, the attention she gives to his wife instead of him,
how Steven Spielberg snubbed him, and how cruel it is to be in Hollywood
if you are a creative person. This slight aim at comedy turns this film
into a slight film. If you really had to see this film, the only reason
I could think of doing so, was to see the attractive Sharon Stone as a
muse.  Even though the script did not provide her with material that was
funny, she did show by her facial expressions and body language that she
has a penchant for comedy if given a chance. At least she was more
lovable than any one else in the film was.</P>
