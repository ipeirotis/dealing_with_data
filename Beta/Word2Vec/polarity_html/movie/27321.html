<P>When you can't get Sissy Spacek to be your star and you get porn star
Marilyn Chambers instead, things should become sexier. Chambers is fine
as Rose, even though her sexual abilities are put under constraints by
the conservative nature of the script. She plays a carefree, attractive
girl who gets into a motorcycle accident while on an isolated road
outside of Montreal, with her boyfriend Hart (Frank Moore) responsible
for the accident. It results in a botched plastic surgery job for her,
as she is taken to the nearby private Keloid Clinic, run by plastic
surgeons Dan and Roxanne Keloid (Howard Ryshpan and Patricia Gage) and
their business partner Murray Cypher (Joel Silver), who is seen talking
to the doctors about becoming a plastic surgery franchise just as the
accident is taking place. Because Rose is in critical condition and will
probably die in a short time, Keloid does an emergency experimental
procedure to try and save her, a radical grafting of her thigh tissue,
inducing a morphogenic, which means that there is the ability to form
any kind of tissue in her system. The side effect that occurs is freaky
indeed -- she develops a fanged phallus under her armpit. With this new
organism, she has the urge to bite her victim and draw blood from them
to get nourishment and she thereby infects them with an incurable type
of unknown rabies, whereby the victim forgets what happened and becomes
like a zombie and goes mad, ready to bite the next victim. Rose will be
the source of a plague that sweeps across Montreal and forces that city
to be under martial law. Hart had only a few broken bones and is sent
home to recover, where he spends his time worrying that she's in a coma.</P>
<P>Director-writer David Cronenberg  (Shivers) is obsessed with the
connection between sex and body functions. He has some fun with this
theme, taking on the subject matter with mock seriousness, showing a
series of attacks caused by Marilyn. The first bite victim is   Lloyd
Walsh, who is pounced on by the writhing Marilyn, as she gets up from
her coma in her hospital bed and manages to sexually arouse the patient
who only wanted to calm her down after he heard her screams; she then
bites a drunken farmer who tries a little hanky-panky with her in the
barn, where she has her arms wrapped around a cow; and after she bites
the farmer, he goes into a diner and attacks the customers; she then
attacks Judy Glasburg in the sauna, who is awaiting an unneeded cosmetic
plastic surgery; and, finally she sneaks out of the hospital and lures a
kind-hearted truck driver Smooth Eddy to give her a hitch before he gets
his bite. As the rabies spreads to the general population, a random
attack in a crowded subway car occurs and my favorite one, an attack in
a mall, where Santa gets shot in the fracas, as the police go after the
biter. There is also an incident in the porno theater, which could have
been funnier. It had Marilyn Chambers sitting alone, the only woman in
the theater, when a guy with a long coat hovers over her and caresses
her and moves to sit next to her for sexual favors, and naturally gets
what he deserves.</P>
<P>Since there is no cure for this rabies, the police are ordered to shoot
the bite victims and their bodies are carted away in garbage trucks. The
film ably depicts the city in a panic and shows the victims foaming at
the mouth, reduced to madness. These scenes are mostly played for shock
value, but have a certain sophisticated humor about them and relate a
concern about medical procedures, alerting us to the fact that doctors
have the power to do just about anything to their patients. One of
film's main faults, is that it offered no characters that we could care
about, but it instead developed an offbeat story that had some kind of
political message hidden in its humor. It was quite enjoyable in a less
than biting way.</P>
