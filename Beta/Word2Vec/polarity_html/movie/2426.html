<PRE>                              ON DEADLY GROUND
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Steven Seagal, Michael Caine, Joan Chen, John C. McGinley.
Screenplay:  Ed Horowitz & Robin U. Russin.
Director:  Steven Seagal.</P>
<P>     Scott's First Law of Hollywood Auteurism reads as follows:
producer/director/star is a bad combination.  Many filmmakers need
someone to be the voice of reason, and that someone is usually the
producer.  The need can be even greater when the filmmaker in question
is a rookie director, which brings us to the First Law's First
Corollary:  be especially wary when the name appearing three times
before the title is Seagal.  ON DEADLY GROUND marks action icon Steven
Seagal's first time in the director's chair, and it looks like it.
Self-indulgent and deadly dull for at least half of its running time,
ON DEADLY GROUND demonstrates why an ego like Seagal's needs something
to keep it in check.</P>
<P>     Seagal's standard issue taciturn butt-kicker is this time called
Forrest Taft, an expert at putting out Alaskan oil well fires.  Early
in the film, Forrest is employed by Aegis Oil chief Michael Jennings
(Michael Caine) to deal with an explosion at one of Aegis' rigs, where
it becomes evident that everything isn't up to specs on the well's
safety equipment.  Furthermore, it appears that the same equipment is
to be used on a massive platform which must meet a start-up deadline in
order for Aegis to retain the mineral rights.  Forrest's life becomes
forfeit when he discovers this information, and Jennings' chief of
security (John C. McGinley) sets him up to die in an explosion.  Of
course, Forrest escapes, and hides out in an Inuit village, learning
Native environmental folklore.  Soon he sets out to make sure the Aegis
1 platform doesn't make its start-up, joined by a native activist (Joan
Chen).</P>
<P>     For those of you who didn't believe Steven Seagal could do
anything more ineptly than he acts, here's evidence to the contrary.
He appears to have learned nothing about pacing and exposition from his
two collaborations with Andrew Davis, turning in an action film
painfully short on action.  The first hour is devoted to an overlong
set-up, briefly interrupted by a barroom brawl so badly edited in
places that they had to dub in exclamations so that it would be clear
exactly where Forrest is kicking his victims.  We are subjected to a
handful of soapbox speeches about environmental degradation, including
one in the middle of a thoroughly pointless dream/vision sequence.
Seagal seems to be laboring under the deluded impression that anyone
who goes to see his films actually wants to hear him speak, because for
sixty minutes he just won't shut up.</P>
<P>     Once it is revealed that (surprise, surprise) Forrest is a CIA-
trained demolition expert, and Jennings sends a pack of professional
killers out to eliminate him, the action picks up.  However, almost
none of it is inspired until Forrest reaches Aegis 1, and almost
invariably the editing is attrocious.  Lots of things blow up in ON
DEADLY GROUND, but there is a "so what" quality to the pyrotechnics.
Still, Seagal at least could have had the sense to end the film with a
bang, instead of with a five minute monologue about the horrors of oil
companies which rivals Kevin Costner's JFK skreed for dramatic
ineptitude.  It isn't even the point that he may be right; he's just
chosen the wrong forum.</P>
<P>     Of course, the ultimate problem with any Steven Seagal project is
that it must inevitably star Steven Seagal.  Where Schwarzenegger
entertains with his comic book persona and one-liners, and Stallone
brings an underdog quality to his action flicks, Seagal's squinting
stoic is just boring.  UNDER SIEGE at least had a chance thanks to
Tommy Lee Jones' lively villain, but Michael Caine is not in that
league, playing a nasty businessman we've seen a hundred times before.
John C. McGinley puts a nice spin on the enforcer role, daring to lose
his cool and admit he's no match for the hero.  If directing ON DEADLY
GROUND is Seagal's idea of stretching himself, I'd offer the words of
Laurence Olivier as advice: "Just *act*, dear boy; it's much easier."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 exploding oil rigs:  2.</PRE>
