<P>CAN'T HARDLY WAIT
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: **1/2 (out of ****) 
Columbia / 1:36 / 1998 / PG-13 
Cast: Ethan Embry; Jennifer Love Hewitt; Charlie Korsmo; Lauren Ambrose; 
Seth Green; Peter Facinelli; Jenna Elfman; Jerry O'Connell; Michelle 
Brookhurst; Melissa Joan Hart 
Director: Harry Elfont; Deborah Kaplan 
Screenplay: Harry Elfont; Deborah Kaplan<HR>Slasher flicks and teen comedies are probably the most well-known 
cinematic staples of the 1980s, and their mainstream potency is still 
being tested today. The "Scream" franchise may have boldly reinvented 
the former, but throwbacks to the latter like "Can't Hardly Wait" aren't 
so much of a revelation. The film doesn't put a new spin on its subgenre 
so much as it repackages bits and pieces of its '80s predecessors and 
peppers the proceedings with many timely pop culture quips. But however 
familiar or shallow things get, an extraordinarily appealing cast runs 
to the rescue; if "Can't Hardly Wait" comes close to working, it's in a 
large part due to its ready-for-"Tiger Beat" players. These mostly fresh 
faces really liven up some otherwise lackluster action. </P>
<P>Most of the action takes place at a big bash to celebrate Huntington 
High School's graduation day. Attending the beer- and sex-soaked 
festivities are our six main teenagers -- requisite nice guy Preston 
(Ethan Embry), prom queen Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt), star jock Mike 
(Peter Facinelli), acerbic wit Denise (Lauren Ambrose), white "homeboy" 
Kenny (Seth Green) and unpopular brainiac William (Charlie Korsmo). 
Kenny, hoping to hook up with a girl and lose his virginity, ends up 
bonding with Denise, who's present out of emotional support for Preston, 
who wants tell Amanda of his longtime crush on her. Amanda has just 
broken up with Mike, who's been tormenting William, who will seek 
revenge against Mike before the night is over. Did you get all that? </P>
<P>Actually, the gossipy character interaction that composes "Can't Hardly 
Wait"'s various story threads ring true for the most part. (Gosh, I was 
there only two years ago!) It's within the characters themselves where 
the movie begins to falter. That they're walking, talking stereotypes 
really doesn't matter; this seems like a deliberate effort on the part 
of co-directors and -writers Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan to emanate 
such "classics" as "The Breakfast Club." But they fail to make their 
entire contemporary cross-section of young people completely 
interesting. Both Michael and William are crudely rendered, and their 
conflict, particularly how it ends, is pretty revolting. The 
Preston-Amanda romance (or lack thereof) is supposed to be Wait's main 
event, but it's hard to care much about either person. </P>
<P>Preston is solely defined by his affection for Amanda, while, in turn, 
all she does throughout the film is mope and pout. The would-be 
relationship somehow manages to click despite the strange, hindering 
oversight that we're never allowed to see why she's so special to him. 
This is not because we root for Preston, but because we root for Ethan 
Embry, whose endearing, natural and occasionally goofy charm makes up 
for his alter-ego's lack of distinction. Embry ("That Thing You Do!") 
does a fine job of getting the audience to identify with the anxiety, 
longing, hesitancy and heartbreak of first love; if only his Preston 
were fully fleshed-out, he'd be worth following into a "Can't Hardly 
Wait" spin-off feature. </P>
<P>On the other hand, Denise and Kenny already are; when the film 
eventually breaks up into several superimposing stories, it is only 
theirs that crackles with the completely realized good-time vibe that 
Elfont and Kaplan were probably going for -- and that's very likely 
because Lauren Ambrose and Seth Green have a great deal of fun bringing 
to life the most comedically vibrant party patrons here. So, while the 
material is distinctly uneven, these winning performers, their 
occasionally winning characters and smattering of winning moments make 
the whole package not much of a chore to endure. "Can't Hardly Wait" is 
a decent attempt to make a film that definitively encapsulates a 
decade's worth of teen fads and attitudes. It's just too bad the far 
more successful "Clueless" beat it to the punch three summers ago.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck

'Look Who's Talking Back,' in which the audience gets its turn?" --
