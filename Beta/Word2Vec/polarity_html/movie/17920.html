<PRE>THE CASTLE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>"I reckon we're the luckiest family in the world," Darryl Kerrigan
(Michael Caton) says with utter sincerity.  He, his wife, Sal (Anne
Tenney), and their family live a quirky Ozzie and Harriet lifestyle in
Australia in Rob Sitch's THE CASTLE.  The most popular domestic film in
Australia when it was released in 1997, the movie has finally reached
the American shores with a nationwide release.</P>
<P>Australian comedy tends to be full of good natured, self-deprecating
humor, and THE CASTLE is firmly in that genre.  A broad parody without a
pretentious bone in its body, the movie stays on target from beginning
to end.  Their jokes aren't anywhere near earth-shakingly funny, but few
miss their mark.  The show is almost guaranteed to keep a smile on your
face (and a sappy song in your heart.)</P>
<P>So what, other than his family, is the source of Darryl's happiness? His
home, a.k.a. his castle.  The youngest son, Dale (Stephen Curry), serves
as the show's syrupy narrator.  He explains some of the reasons his
father is so proud of the family's home.  First, it is "worth almost as
much as he paid for it."  Second, there is the real estate admonition
that the 3 most important things are "location, location, location."
Their house, being right next to the airport runway, could not be more
convenient for traveling -- not that they've ever even left the county.
Finally, they are right under monstrous power lines, which serve to
remind his dad of man's progress.</P>
<P>The first act introduces us to the family.  The father dotes on his wife
and seizes every opportunity to compliment her, especially at mealtime.
When she serves something as plain as chicken, he remarks on how
ingenious it was of her to sprinkle that seasoning on top.  When there's
ice cream for dessert, he's sure she did something special to make it
taste so wonderful.  She says she just scooped it.  These many mealtime
sequences work so well because the people are so genuine that the movie
plays like a quirky documentary with shades of the funniest documentary
in years, HANDS ON A HARDBODY</P>
<P>The middle brother, Steve (Anthony Simcoe), wiles away his hours reading
about potential bargains in The Trading Post.  His father always asks
the cost of the item, obscure paraphernalia like jousting sticks being
typical, and always retorts that the seller "is dreaming" about the
given price.  The price must have been right on some of the goodies,
since their house is filled with junk and with the wife's tacky
arts-and-crafts creations.</P>
<P>The rest of the family consists of the recently married daughter, Tracy
(Sophie Lee), a graduate of the Sunshine Tech hairdressing college, and
the older brother Wayne (Wayne Hope), who is in prison for 8 years for a
robbery.  They're all good, grown kids, even Wayne.</P>
<P>In the second act, the family's home is threatened.  The billion-dollar
company that owns the airport tries to seize their house and those next
to them in order to expand the airport facilities.  Being partly a
government agency, they have the right under Australian law to take the
land once the owners are adequately compensated.  The problem is that
the father doesn't want to sell for any price.</P>
<P>With full faith that all he need do is explain his case to a judge,
Darryl bases his argument on common sense rather than the law.  "It's
not a house, it's a home," he informs the judge.  "A man's home is his
castle."  QED.  Not impressed with such emotional logic, the judge rules
against him.</P>
<P>The story is at its funniest in the next act, when Darryl attempts to
enlist the help of the incompetent lawyer, Dennis Denuto (Tiriel Mora),
who lost Wayne's case.  Dennis tries his best not to take the case
reasoning that this is a federal issue, and he is a small-time local
lawyer, handling only minor state cases.  Eventually, he accepts and
decides to challenge the constitutionality of the seizure.  The
Roman-numeral-challenged Dennis bases his arguments to the appeals
court, not on any specific statute, but on the "vibe" of the
constitution.  The judge just stares at Dennis in disbelief.</P>
<P>The last act takes some predicable twists before arriving at its
mandatory happy ending.  The fast-paced story has enough sweet humor to
keep our interest, and the filmmaker makes sure to end the picture
quickly so there is no danger of its overstaying its welcome.  This
light-hearted entertainment is the type of movie that you can call cute
without any tinge of sarcasm.  If you're in the mood for cute, then this
is your movie.</P>
<P>THE CASTLE runs a fast 1:22.  It is rated R for some profanity and would
be fine for teenagers.</P>
