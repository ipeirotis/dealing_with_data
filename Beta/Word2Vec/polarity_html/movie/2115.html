<P>     It's dangerous to live in Quentin Tarantino's world, as Clarence
Worley (Christian Slater) discovers in the explosive TRUE ROMANCE.
When Clarence, a loner with a love of low-budget Kung Fu movies, meets
Alabama Whitman (Patricia Arquette), a callgirl, it's love at first
sight.  After a heady night spent in each other's arms and out on a
billboard making true confessions, the two decide to get married.
After that, at the advise of an Elvis (Val Kilmer) who inhabits his
mind, Clarence decides to go to Alabama's pimp (Gary Oldman) and tell
him that she's through working.  What ensues is a vicious gunfight that
leaves two people dead and Clarence with a suitcase of high-value
cocaine that everybody--including mob boss Vincenzo Coccoti
(Christopher Walken)--want to get their hands on.</P>
<P>     There's good news and bad news about TRUE ROMANCE.  The good news
is that it's written by Quentin Tarantino, the man who made a stunning
splash as the writer/director of last year's RESERVOIR DOGS.  The bad
news is that it isn't directed by him.  At the helm instead is Tony
Scott, the man who foisted TOP GUN and BEVERLY HILLS COP II on us.</P>
<P>     Like RESERVOIR DOGS, TRUE ROMANCE is filled with witty dialogue;
sharp, macabre humor; and more bullets and blood than one would think
likely for the running time.  Tarantino's script is loaded with energy
and brimming with power.  This film is a wild, wild ride whose slower
moments are still punctuated by one-liners that only one other
screenwriter (David Mamet) seems capable of penning.</P>
<P>     Director Scott tries his hardest to turn this film into a typical
Hollywood picture suitable for mass consumption.  His style lacks
punch--he goes for the safe, pretty shots that can be found in almost
any action film.  It makes one wonder how different this movie might
have been had Tarantino helmed it--his methods, which borrow heavily
from John Woo and Martin Scorcese, are stark and crisp, and probably
would have complemented the script nicely.</P>
<P>     The story, however, is too good to be seriously damaged by
pedestrian direction.  However deeply Scott was involved in the
production of this film, his role clearly didn't extend to messing with
what Tarantino had written.  Those who have seen RESERVOIR DOGS will
recognize the similarities, which include a hilarious opening
conversation (TRUE ROMANCE's is about Elvis where RESERVOIR DOGS' is
about Madonna's "Like a Virgin") and a multi-sided, drawn-guns
showdown.</P>
<P>     My favorite scene is a confrontation between mob don Christopher
Walken and Clarence's father (Dennis Hopper).  Sparks, as well as any
number of racial epithets, fly during this visceral and violent
tete-a-tete, which includes some of Tarantino's best dialogue and
Scott's most proficient direction.  Walken has never been more
sardonically menacing, and Hopper somehow manages to give an impression
of restraint.  In a word, this four-minute gem is astounding.</P>
<P>     For the most part, the characters are well-written and
nicely-developed.  My lone quibble is that the romance between Clarence
and Alabama seemed forced.  Necessary though it is to the plot, it's
rushed through too quickly, and I had a hard time accepting how
desperately in love these two are supposed to be.  While their romantic
chemistry is in doubt, they make great partners when it comes to crime,
bloodshed, and being on the run.</P>
<P>     Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette (whose appearance is
unbelievably different from that of her last part, in ETHAN FROME) are
perfect for these roles, knowing exactly how to put the right amount of
energy into Clarence and Alabama without turning them into
caricatures.  The supporting players are equally good, including
Bronson Pinchot as a boot-licking actor who appears to have been
included more for comic relief than anything else.  Those looking for
another link to RESERVOIR DOGS (however slim) will find Chris Penn in
the cast.</P>
<P>     In many ways, TRUE ROMANCE is an assault on the senses.  It works
best in a big theater with an impressive sound system.  Hans Zimmer's
score is on overdrive, and the soundtrack blares rock-and-roll.
Somehow, TRUE ROMANCE on video isn't going to be nearly the same
experience.</P>
<P>     The cautionary warning given for RESERVOIR DOGS applies: those
who are disturbed by extreme violence and profanity should stay away.
There is no single scene in TRUE ROMANCE as gut-wrenching as the
torture in RESERVOIR DOGS, but there are plenty of bullets and lots of
blood.  The film is graphic in everything it does, and those who prefer
sedate motion pictures will not find this one a pleasant experience.</P>
<P>     Tarantino is a hot prospect now, which is good for anyone who
enjoys this kind of intense, intelligent, and unapologetically violent
thriller.  Films such as TRUE ROMANCE don't come along very
often--movies unafraid of slipping the bonds of convention in the name
of giving the audience something new and exhilarating.  For those who
aren't bothered by blood and bad language, this is a motion picture to
add to 1993's "must see" list.</P>
