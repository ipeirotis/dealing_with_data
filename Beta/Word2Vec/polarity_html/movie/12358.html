<P>     Another summer, another double-dip of disaster dramas.  This time 
around, instead of volcanoes, it's comets.  The films in question, Mimi 
Leder's DEEP IMPACT and Michael Bay's ARMAGEDDON, are separated by two 
months, so the first should have a chance to run its course before the 
second reaches the screen.  (More likely, the first will get squashed by 
GODZILLA.)  The movies, while utilizing similar premises (big piece of 
space debris on collision course with our beloved planet), have 
fundamentally different slants.  DEEP IMPACT focuses more on the Earth-
based sitting ducks than on the would-be astronaut heroes.  ARMAGEDDON 
sends Bruce Willis into space to kick asteroid. (ARMAGEDDON is not near 
the top of my "must see" list -- after MERCURY RISING, I've had enough 
of Willis for the year.)</P>
<P>     By their very nature, disaster movies tend to be mediocre (at 
best).  Going into DEEP IMPACT, my primary reason for optimism was the 
recognition that the cast is loaded (Robert Duvall, Vanessa Redgrave, 
Maximilian Schell, Morgan Freeman, James Cromwell).  I mean, how bad can 
a movie be with names like that?  Unfortunately, an A-list group of 
actors doesn't mean a lot when there isn't much of a script.  Somewhere 
within DEEP IMPACT, there's a worthwhile story struggling to get out.  
Sadly, it never emerges, and what we're saddled with is a poorly 
concentrated tale that builds "drama" by using an avalanche of clichés.  </P>
<P>     The film opens with a modicum of promise by detailing the initial 
discovery of comet Wolf-Biederman by high school student Leo Biederman 
(Elijah Wood), who's at a telescope party with his local astronomy club.  
One year later, after overeager TV reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) 
stumbles onto a story about the approach of an E.L.E. (Extinction Level 
Event), President Beck (Morgan Freeman) is forced to address the nation 
and reveal that a comet the size of Manhattan is on a collision course 
with the Earth.  The planet is not defenseless, however:  a spaceship 
has been constructed with the sole purpose of landing on the comet, 
planting nuclear devices, and blowing the "dirty snowball" off course.  
On board the space ship "Messiah" is the aging veteran of many 
assignments, Spurgeon "Fish" Tanner (Robert Duvall), who is twice as old 
as anyone else in the crew.  But, even as the "Messiah" mission gets 
underway, the men and women of the Earth prepare for the worst, which 
appears increasingly likely to happen.</P>
<P>     One of the most obvious problems with DEEP IMPACT is that there are 
too many characters, each with too little personality.  At any given 
time, there are at least four subplots (the President's response to the 
situation, the TV reporter's family problems, the astronauts' mission, 
and a teen romance) vying for screen time.  Consequently, none of the 
characters are given the opportunity to become real or important to us.  
In TITANIC, which is essentially a disaster movie with a romance tacked 
on, James Cameron had the right idea:  focus on a few, select 
individuals.  Had DEEP IMPACT taken this approach, it might have been 
more gripping.  As it is, the viewer sits patiently in his or her seat, 
enduring all sorts of perfunctory, "character building" moments while 
waiting for the special effects show to begin.  </P>
<P>     Since this is a disaster movie, some sort of cataclysm is expected, 
and, in that, DEEP IMPACT does not disappoint.  While the special 
effects sequences are not eye-popping, they generate a certain visceral 
satisfaction.  And, although a huge tidal wave bearing down on the 
United States' east coast looks computer generated, it's impressive 
nonetheless.  Still, the catastrophe passes a little too quickly, and it 
fails to generate the kind of awe that the film makers were striving 
for.  The science in DEEP IMPACT is adequate for a big-budget summer 
flick, but hardly flawless.</P>
<P>     This is director Mimi Leder's follow-up to THE PEACEMAKER, and it's 
not a great deal more successful.  The same basic problem is evident:  
she has the actors, the visual effects, the camerawork, and the 
technical know-how, but all of that can't cover up the fundamental 
weakness of a flawed, inadequate screenplay.  At times, I felt like I 
was watching a stripped-down version of INDEPENDENCE DAY, minus the 
aliens and the charm of Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum.  DEEP IMPACT has a 
bushel of good actors, but they're all on hand to pick up paychecks.  In 
fact, several key players -- namely Vanessa Redgrave, Maximilian Schell, 
and James Cromwell -- are seriously underused.  The emotional 
cornerstone of the film is intended to be Tea Leoni (FLIRTING WITH 
DISASTER), but, as perky and appealing as the actress can be, her 
character is so sketchily developed that it's difficult to identify with 
her.</P>
<P>     In the end, it all comes down to caring about the characters and 
their circumstances, and I didn't.  Also, while the film teases us with 
some dramatically-rich ideas (How would men and women react if they knew 
that the end of the world was imminent?), it doesn't follow through.  
We're given glimpses of possibilities, but nothing is developed, and 
that makes it all the more frustrating.  It all turns into background 
noise in the lives of about a dozen two-dimensional, stock characters.  
Needless to say, the movie isn't as profound as the title suggests.  In 
fact, when considering the impact of Leder's film, the word "shallow" 
leaps to mind far more readily than "deep."</P>
