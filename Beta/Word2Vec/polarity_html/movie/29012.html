<P>The Brad Anderson Sessions: On Session 9 and Happy Accidents </P>
<P>A feature story by Jeremiah Kipp - Copyright © 2001 filmcritic.com</P>
<P>Brad Anderson's character-driven horror film Session 9 charts the
deteriorating mental states of a waste management team as they clear out
an abandoned, dilapidated asylum.  Shot in and around an actual
Victorian-era mental hospital in Danvers, Massachusetts, it remains
ambivalent whether some supernatural manifestation of evil is taking
over these men and forcing them to inflict physical and psychological
damage upon each other.  It could be all in their minds, the stress of
dead-end lives catching up with them.  Over the course of a single week,
their lines of defense gradually break down.</P>
<P>It's a paranoid creepshow that takes itself seriously, going for genuine
dread rather than the postmodern riffs on the slasher genre we've become
accustomed to.  Anderson's style may seem revolutionary if you're only
familiar with Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer (not to mention
their seemingly endless knock-offs), but it actually recalls spooky
classics from the 70's and early 80's.  Don't Look Now and Stanley
Kubrick's The Shining are cited as obvious references, but there are
echoes of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Dawn of the Dead, The
Exorcist, and John Carpenter's The Thing.  I run through this makeshift
laundry list only because if you're a fan of those particular movies,
you really ought to check out Session 9.  More frightening and mature
than The Blair Witch Project, it's enough to bolster new hope for the
horror genre.</P>
<P>Anderson was open to discussing Session 9's upcoming release (August 10)
with filmcritic.com during the press junket held at the Regency Hotel in
NYC.  Session 9 cast members Josh Lucas and Stephen Gevedon (who
co-wrote the screenplay with Anderson) also shared their thoughts on the
film.  Anderson also brooked philosophical about Happy Accidents, his
long delayed (and quite enjoyable) romantic comedy about a girl who
falls for a guy who claims to be from the future.  Picked up by IFC
Films, Happy Accidents will be in limited release starting August 24.</P>
<P>filmcritic.com: Let's talk about Session 9.</P>
<P>Brad Anderson: With Session 9, we weren't going for jolts (things
jumping out of closets and stuff) as much as we were creating an
atmosphere of dread or menace that lives with you.  These faux-horror
movies made nowadays are much more "teen thrillers" in my mind.  We
didn't want to use kid actors in our movie.  Besides Brendan (Sexton
III), we used older guys! (claps Gevedon on the shoulder, laughs)</P>
<P>Is it significant that the main characters are all men, or a certain
working-class type of man?  There are no central women characters.</P>
<P>BA: That was a conscious effort on my part.  At least two of my three
movies prior to this could be described as women's pictures.  Part of my
reason for Session 9 was to break out, to destroy the illusion of me as
"Mr. Romantic Comedy Guy."  The idea of making a movie focused on this
crew of guys was really appealing.</P>
<P>Josh Lucas: The script had a very classy element of something you very
rarely see in this culture, which was a group of working class men.  For
these struggling guys, the idea about the American Dream (prosperity and
wealth) doesn't necessarily exist.  It's fascinating to see them put
into circumstances where some horror elements emerge.  I became
interested because it was a very different take on the genre, and also
because I knew they had Peter Mullan (playing Gordon).</P>
<P>BA: I think the thing that drew Peter to the project was that he saw
Gordon's story as a tragedy.  A man from overseas comes to this country
to pursue the American dream, is trying to keep his own business afloat,
and is struggling with the stress of having a new baby and being a
father.  All of these things are impinging on him at once and he's about
to snap.  Unlike most horror movies in this day and age, the horror is
around the edges.  It's largely interior for Gordon.</P>
<P>Session 9 can be interpreted in different ways.  You can get the sense
that Gordon breathes in an evil spirit, but can also be read as a much
more clinical movie that shows a man who becomes unhinged, or may be
going mad.  An inspiration was Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now.  That's a
really good horror movie.  What we drew from that movie was the place
(the back alleys of Venice) being so instrumental in creating the tone. 
Donald Sutherland's character is realizing that he has the gift of
clairvoyance, trying to figure out a mystery, and at the end of the day
figures out that he himself is the center of that mystery.  Peter Weir's
The Last Wave ends the same way!  It's the most awful epiphany that you
can have!</P>
<P>Josh, your character (Hank) has a monologue midway through the movie
about the way these men deal with stress.  Did that strike a chord with
you as an actor?</P>
<P>JL: Yeah, absolutely.  While making the movie, it was a little more
intimate than usual.  The core group of actors sat around every night to
talk about those things.  It's a low-budget movie, not easy to make by
any means, made wicked fast with huge chunks of filmmaking (not
necessarily dialogue, either) to achieve on a given day.  There is the
question of how to handle it.  I wondered how these characters handled
themselves, too, because they come from such a different space.  There's
no passion in what they do.  It's pure survival.</P>
<P>Go with me here for a second and let me know what you think.  Of the
five guys, I thought Hank was most alone in some ways.  Pete (David
Caruso) is the manager and has his crew, Mike (Gevedon) is the college
guy who everyone seems to like and respect, and Jeff (Sexton) and Gordon
(Mullan) are family.  Hank doesn't have anything besides his dream of
winning the lottery.  Even when he's home, he's seen watching television
not interacting with his girlfriend.  Do you think that contributes to
his character, or am I entirely off the mark here?</P>
<P>JL: No, you're right.  It's a fascinating comment and I agree.  Hank
isn't even attached to someone like his boss, Pete, who seems to be a
really good man.  He's truly at a point where he just doesn't care and
will do anything to get out of his situation.  That's just an amazing
place to be in your life.  He's the person who has nothing.  When you
start to do that, you want to take from other people.  "I want to make
you feel the same way."  That's what really happened when he stole
Pete's girlfriend.  It has nothing to do with her at all.  His
loneliness is so acute that he will screw over his friends.</P>
<P>Session 9 was obviously built around this very creepy location (and it
seemed like you could point the camera in any direction and get a good
shot).</P>
<P>BA: I had been to the Danvers State Hospital before, since I used to
live in Boston and always thought it would make a remarkable setting for
a horror movie.  There's asbestos everywhere, floors are caving in,
ceilings are collapsing, everything's cold and damp -- exactly the way
we present it in Session 9.</P>
<P>Stephen Gevedon: Once it starts getting overcast, the place gets dark
very quick, even in the upstairs buildings where the windows aren't
boarded up.  It's a pretty dangerous place.</P>
<P>BA: Steve and I went up there last spring and had a chance to explore.</P>
<P>SG: Let's just call a spade a spade.  We broke in.  It's lucky we didn't
get caught.  We wandered around and discovered many of the movie's
setpieces (like Jeff wandering around in the underground tunnel) from
that first visit.</P>
<P>BA: We found all sorts of creepy medical instruments and a
straightjacket and stuff.  
We also got a sense of the asylum's history.  Even if you're a very
skeptical person about the supernatural, that place is so emotionally
heavy.  Hundreds of thousands of people were wrongfully committed and
lived out their lives locked in these tiny little rooms that they call
"seclusions".  It's tragic.  Even in the pauper's cemetery [seen in the
movie when Gordon wanders off alone to make a desperate phone call to
his wife], the patients didn't even have the courtesy of having their
names placed on the numbered headstones.  It was like throwing them into
a mass grave. </P>
<P>How did you research the taped sessions that Mike discovers (between a
doctor and a woman with multiple personality disorder)?</P>
<P>BA: I did some research into multiple personality disorder and found
some transcripts online.  (I'm telling ya, you can find everything
online!)  These transcripts were not that different from what you see in
the movie.  In an instant, the patient would make a switch from one
multiple personality to the next.  Her voice and entire personality
would change while the doctor was listening and asking questions.  Even
reading about it is creepy.</P>
<P>How did you determine the "look" of Happy Accidents, your other movie
coming out this August? Were you going for something otherworldly
because of the science fiction angle or did you have something else in
mind?</P>
<P>BA: Since the story felt conceptual and had a high-concept sci-fi twist,
I wanted the look to be very raw and real.  With that in mind, I
purposefully shot hand-held with 35mm cameras.  I've done that with all
my other films (except for Session 9, which has a more formal
approach.)  It's a little bit documentary-style, which probably evolved
out of my early interest in non-fiction film.</P>
<P>What did you see in Vincent D'Onofrio's audition? It's a role that seems
open to different interpretations.  </P>
<P>BA: Part of it was Vince's ability to transform himself into whatever
the role may require.  He had to be a guy who might be mentally ill,
walking the thin line where he could be insane or potentially
dangerous.  Vince had those qualities but was also can be incredibly
endearing and sweet, with a sort of boyish charm.  He's a chameleon.</P>
<P>It was also fun to cast him against type.  Aside from maybe Mystic Pizza
or a couple others I don't think he's has done much in the way of
comedy.  He's not some movie matinee idol.  Vince (as Sam) and Marisa
Tomei (who plays Ruby) are a goofy couple!  He's this big, lumbering guy
and she's this sweet, petite woman.  You don't see that in movies! 
Everyone's always so perfectly paired, so I thought this was a chance to
break down some of the more obvious romantic comedy conventions.  If
this were a studio picture, they would never cast Vince.  They would
probably cast Josh Hartnett!  That doesn't interest me.  If you're
making a smaller movie, you're almost obligated to do something
unexpected and surprising.</P>
<P>Could we talk about your use of specific cities?  Next Stop Wonderland
was Bahhhston -</P>
<PRE>BA: Bahhhhston…</PRE>
<P>Yeah, and Happy Accidents is New York.  Do you think shooting in
different cities lends a unique character to the movies you work on?</P>
<P>BA: Yeah, up until this point I've pretty much written about the things
I know or places I know.  With Boston, certainly, you could say, as the
producer of Next Stop Wonderland likes to describe it, "a valentine to
Boston." (laughs) Whatever that means!</P>
<P>Happy Accidents is somehow imbued more with the chaos of New York --
these crazy people you meet on the street who might be time travelers. 
Or, as in the last scene, it's about the traffic and noise and madness
of this city (which is a wonderful thing but could also drive you
nuts.)  I had moved here from Boston around the time that I worked on
that script and was still a newbie fascinated by New York and all the
big buildings.</P>
<P>You do this thing in the movie which is kinda cool -- I guess you would
call it "memory photos" or something, done with stills --</P>
<PRE>BA: Yeah.</PRE>
<P>Am I being pretentious to ask if that was inspired by Chris Marker's La
Jetee, or what?</P>
<P>(laughs) I've heard that referenced so many times, but I haven't seen
the movie! I know what you're saying, though.  No, those little
sequences were described in the script as visions of the future by way
of Ruby's imagination.  It's Sam telling her what the future is like,
why he came back, and all that.  He's sharing with her this stuff and
she's looking at him like, "You're insane."</P>
<P>As Ruby is describing this stuff to her friend, we're seeing all these
strange images.  It was kept expressionistic. I didn't want these
"glimpses of the future" to be grounded in realism because we want to
keep guessing: is Sam a nut or is he from another time?</P>
<P>Originally, we were gonna play into the stupid sci-fi clichés of time
travel, all these green-screen images of Sam sitting on a weird
mountaintop against a purple sky.  Since I didn't have the budget, I
decided instead to take actual still images from the movie itself to
vaguely illustrate what Sam was describing.  The other very subtle thing
was that all the images in these sequences are actually from later
sequences so in some ways they actually are images from the future (of
the movie).</P>
<P>I promise not to bring up La Jetee again.</P>
<P>BA: Hey, man, compare the movie to as many classics as you want! </P>
<P>Do you consider Happy Accidents science fiction?</P>
<P>No.  I consider it a kitchen sink dramatic romance.  The sci-fi angle is
really a twist.  The initial premise was to do a very simple
relationship movie.  Then it was trying to think what could be the most
absurd monkey-wrench that could screw it all up.  What could be
something that one of the people reveals about themselves that could
throw everything off?  I'm from the future, or I'm an alien, or I'm gay,
or whatever the revelation might be between the two partners.</P>
<P>The problem actually becomes the very thing that keeps the relationship
interesting.  You don't fall in love with someone because they're
perfect and meet your requirements -- you fall for the things that are
different about them or even problematic.  If you're in love with the
perfect person, that's gonna be over the moment the sex starts becoming
routine.</P>
<P>Ruby's character is against the wall.  How's she gonna react to this? 
The logical, most obvious response would be to immediately kick this guy
out onto the street, but the fact that she holds on to him is an
indication of her way to deal with these kinds of relationships.  She
tries to "fix" men, so she sees it as a challenge.  I've known some
women like that in my life, not that I'm a problem that needs to be
fixed! (laughs)</P>
<P>Sam is very articulate about time travel.  Did you do any homework or
was it all just fancy?</P>
<P>BA: It was a combination of both.  Once again, I did a lot of research
online!  You can find all these wacky internet people who genuinely
believe they're from the future.  I read books about time travel theory,
just to get into the meat of it.  In Happy Accidents, if you go back
into time, you don't simply replicate the exact series of events that
lead to your future.  It's not pre-determined.  You go back into time
and the moment you arrive wherever you arrive, your actions then begin
to bud off and create a new line, which is a parallel universe.  There
could be an infinite number of parallel universes!</P>
<P>As for all of Sam's kooky descriptions of the future, those were somehow
found deep in the recesses of my imagination.</P>
