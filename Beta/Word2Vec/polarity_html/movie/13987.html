<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Among my fanatical ticker tape-worshipping friends, there's one who
   happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character
   in Darren Aronofsky's darkly original PI: the entire stock market can
   be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which, through
   analysis, will produce information to accurately forecast future
   behaviour.  (An example of the mentality involved: if the stock price
   goes up like this, and then down like that, and then sharply up this
   way, it then will go *this* way.)  While I freely admit that I know
   less than nothing about the market (knowledge check: prices up --
   good; prices down -- bad; most of the time, at least) and hence really
   couldn't comment with any authority, it's always nonetheless struck me
   as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex
   system (and besides, if it were that simple, no doubt somebody
   would've already figured it all out).  The difference in this case is
   that while my colleague (an otherwise assuredly realistic individual)
   truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster, PI
   uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its
   character's psychosis.  It's also vastly more convincing with its
   argument.</P>
<P>   "Mathematics is the language of the universe," insists genius
   protagonist Maximillian Cohen (Sean Gullette) in a cool, mantra-like
   voice-over which repeats throughout the picture.  Since nature can be
   expressed in numbers, and there are patterns everywhere in nature, he
   reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him
   to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market, how
   many games the Yankees will win this year, the flavour of jam I'm
   going to put on my toast tomorrow morning.  Obsessed with finding the
   proverbial key to the universe, Max lives in paranoid, self-imposed
   solitude in a seedy NYC Chinatown apartment, single-mindedly toiling
   away with his monstrous homemade computer system.  Sullenly withdrawn
   and plauged by debilitating migraines, the elusive pursuit of a
   mysterious 216-digit number his machine spits out one day is driving
   him into madness.</P>
<P>   The story, then, is basically an eccentricity, but it's a clever,
   astute eccentricity, perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of
   mathematical reductionism; in an age where a dominant societal phobia
   is one's individualism being replaced by a series of numeric
   identifiers, Max's all-consuming penchent for numbers at once creates
   a lingering, unsettling mood.</P>
<P>   It helps matters that he's not a particularly likable protagonist.
   All attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by
   Max, a spindly, neurotic-looking individual who hasn't the time to
   indulge in pleasantries.  For a film which puts its lead character
   front and center (Mr. Gullette appears in virtually every scene), PI
   takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional
   aesthetics; because of our ambivalence with Max, we're not so much
   avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we're
   following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid
   fascination -- it's more disturbing journey than quest.</P>
<P>   Still, we do care about Max's fate.  Teetering on the edge of
   dementia, he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want
   to pick his brain, both fronted by deliciously perky, resolutely
   cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions.  As
   we know, in films where paranoia is a dominant element (see THE
   TRUMAN SHOW's Laura Linney character), or for that matter, in real
   life, it's always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are
   overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary.</P>
<P>   PI, a film that addresses patterns, itself intentionally adheres to an
   identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene; important revelation or
   bit of plot development; pill-popping montage; hallucinatory nightmare
   (with decidedly Cronenberg-esque undertones -- few other directors are
   as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body-themed
   horror); nosebleeding reality.  The repetitiveness, far from being
   tedious, is effectively maddening; more than anything, the picture
   aims to get under our skins and take in events from Max's
   claustrophobic perspective.</P>
<P>   In this regard, it wildly succeeds due to Mr. Aronofsky's striking
   direction.  It's a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself
   into a protagonist's warped perspective of his surrounding, and high
   contrast black-and-white cinematography combined with constant usage
   of extreme close-ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the
   proceedings.  (In some scenes, the stark composition in conjunction
   with the lumbering approach by Mr. Gullette make his character
   curiously resemble a latter-day Max Schreck, from NOSFERATU.)  Using
   savage, jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of
   disorientation, the picture is often dizzying to behold, and Max's
   effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so-called
   Snorri Cam, which keep him in plain focus while the environment races
   by in blurred bursts.  PI's raw, aggressive visuals are reminiscent of
   David Lynch's early work (in particular, ERASERHEAD).</P>
<P>   The film's sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a
   dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic
   score by Clint Mansell, and gradually increases in intensity.  Still,
   amidst all its Kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood, PI
   does occasionally display a sense of humour.  At one point, Marcy
   Dawson (Pamela Hart, great fun) entices Max with the offer of an
   invaluable treasure: a one-of-a-kind ... computer chip.  "Isn't it
   beautiful," she coos.</P>
<P>   A showcase for Mr. Aronofsky's technical virtuosity (made for
   $60 000, it's since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 Sundance
   Film Festival), PI is an intriguingly cerebral story which,
   ironically, is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year.</P>

"...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
 sponsor is generally a pathetic fetus of a film, nothing more."
