THE YARDS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>THE YARDS, by director James Gray (LITTLE ODESSA), is a keenly observant 
film about a pair of two-bit hoods who accidentally get in way over 
their heads.  The charismatic but foolish criminals, Leo Handler and 
Willie Gutierrez, are played masterfully by Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin 
Phoenix.  Reminiscent of a gritty 1950s crime drama, the quiet film is a 
poignant character study of smoldering intensity that could easily have 
starred a young Marlon Brando and James Dean.</P>
<P>Just out of prison for stealing cars, Leo, with his soulful, downcast 
eyes, just wants to keep his nose clean.  The movie's central, tragic 
figure, Leo needs a job to help his poor and ailing mother (Ellen 
Burstyn).  Turning for help to a relative, Leo visits his uncle, Frank 
Olchin, who runs a large repair facility that specializes in fixing New 
York City transit trains and buses.  A corrupt businessman but caring 
family man, Frank is played in a sweetly nuanced performance by James 
Caan, last seen, impressively, as an aging crook in THE WAY OF THE GUN.</P>
<P>Frank wants Leo to learn a trade and become a union machinist, but Leo 
isn't willing to live off of hand-outs from Frank until he finishes his 
training.  Instead, Leo wants to "work with the suits" like his old 
buddy Willie does.  Willie, you see, specializes in greasing palms to 
land and keep lucrative city contracts for Frank.  Frank's wife (Faye 
Dunaway) likes this idea, as does his step-daughter (Charlize Theron), 
who is close to being engaged to Willie.</P>
<P>Besides dispensing graft, Willie is also in charge of a band of 
hooligans who destroy the competition's handiwork.  When Willie and Leo 
are on one of these search-and-destroy missions at "the (rail) yards" in 
Queens, things go badly awry, and someone dies.  This taxes Frank's 
legendary ability to control situations.  It may be something that even 
he can't cover up.</P>
<P>If the script, by James Gray and Matt Reeves, has a problem, it is that 
so much effort has gone into preparing three juicy roles for Leo, Willie 
and Frank that the other parts don't have much to do other than provide 
filler.  But that's a minor quibble for this simple story of great 
power.  The music, including "Saturn" from Gustav Holst's "The Planets," 
reinforces but doesn't overwhelm the solemnity of the drama.</P>
<P>The best part of the production is Harris Savides's warmly intimate 
cinematography that is lit with light that seems to come from small 
incandescent bulbs filtered through old, yellowed lamp shades.   Shot in 
shadows through door slits and frequently from a distance, he makes us 
observers of the action rather than participants.</P>
<P>The journey is the reward in this somber, cautionary tale.  Wahlberg's 
sympathetic portrayal of an unlucky loser is probably the best work that 
he has ever done.  But almost everything about the movie is an 
exception.  In an era in which Quentin Tarantino's influence means that 
films usually opt for maximum violence, THE YARDS has remarkably little, 
concentrating its energy, instead, on a perceptive examination of the 
characters, not the action.  </P>
<P>THE YARDS runs 1:55.  It is rated R for language, violence and a scene 
of sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
