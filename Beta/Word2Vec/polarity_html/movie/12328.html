<P>     Actor Bob Hoskins describes Shane Meadows' TWENTYFOURSEVEN (which 
is short for "twenty four hours a day, seven days a week") as "one of 
the most important films I have ever been involved with."  However, 
while Hoskins' performance is laudable, the movie as a whole is a 
letdown -- oddly paced, erratically scripted, and with a message that is 
so obvious that I felt like I was being bludgeoned to death with it.  
Who doesn't acknowledge that life is only worth living when one has 
something to believe in?</P>
<P>     The story behind the film's director is more interesting than the 
movie itself.  The 25 year-old Meadows grew up in the projects of 
Nottingham (where TWENTYFOURSEVEN is set, a place that Hoskins describes 
as making "Detroit look like Never-Never Land"), dropped out of school 
at the age of 15, and never received any professional film training.  
But, while his style evidences the edginess one might expect from 
someone with his background, Meadows' approach doesn't seem any more 
remarkable than that of many of today's new generation of film makers.  
Before seeing the movie, everything I had heard about TWENTYFOURSEVEN 
indicated that it is a "stunning" feature; twelve hours after the 
closing credits rolled, I'm still waiting to be stunned.</P>
<P>     The hero of the story is Alan Darcy (Bob Hoskins), a middle-aged 
man who decides to invigorate his dying industrial community by starting 
up a boxing club to get the local kids off drugs, off the streets, and 
into the ring.  Each of the dozen or so young men that Darcy takes under 
his wing has a different sort of problem.  One is an addict, one has a 
weight problem, one suffers the taunts of an abusive, overbearing 
father, and one has an explosive temper.  Reluctantly at first, but then 
with growing enthusiasm, they listen as Darcy preaches his mantra of 
control.  What none of them realizes is how close to the psychological 
edge their new mentor is.  </P>
<P>     While the final twenty minutes of TWENTYFOURSEVEN is effective (and 
even a little shocking), it doesn't erase the weakness of the 
predictable melodrama that precedes it.  For much of its running time, 
the film doesn't go anywhere -- it's a relatively uninspired look at how 
a bunch of directionless kids turn their lives around by finding the 
meaning of life in a boxing ring.  This is a standard plot, and, aside 
from the black-and-white, pseudo-documentary look of the film, Meadows 
doesn't offer anything new.  None of the characters, with the possible 
exception of Darcy, are well-developed.  In the end, it's hard to care 
about any of them -- whether they live, die, climb out of the hole dug 
for them by Thatcherism, or fall back into it.  Meadows has crafted a 
movie with a stark appearance, but one that doesn't have much of a 
heart.</P>
<P>     It's also worth questioning the idea that it's a good thing for 
teen boys to harness their unrest by climbing into a boxing ring and 
beating each other bloody.  TWENTYFOURSEVEN isn't the only recent movie 
to embrace this tactic -- last year's THE BOXER used the same approach.  
Apparently, film makers think the controlled violence of boxing is the 
only way to "save" a disaffected generation in economically-downtrodden 
areas.  Is this really the best solution?  How about a basketball or 
soccer clinic?  Then the spirit of competition is still alive, but it's 
tempered by a strong sense of being part of a team, and the victim is a 
ball, not someone else's face.  </P>
<P>     Meadows cast his friends, not professional actors (Hoskins being 
the exception), in TWENTYFOURSEVEN.  While it's occasionally evident 
that we're not watching seasoned thespians, it's never a serious 
problem, since most of the performances are credible.  Hoskins displays 
great range as Darcy -- depending on the circumstances, he can be a 
funny, tragic, heroic, or horrific figure.  It's unfortunate that the 
actor's efforts couldn't have been focused on a better-developed 
individual.  </P>
<P>     TWENTYFOURSEVEN is supposed to be one of those gritty, coming-of-
age stories cut from the same cloth as BOYZ 'N THE HOOD and HATE -- a 
movie that shows life in poverty-stricken, urban neighborhoods the way 
it really is.  But, while TWENTYFOURSEVEN was filmed in a crime-
infested, economically ravaged area, the power and urgency of the 
setting is not conveyed through the narrative.  Meadows clearly has 
ambition and desire, and he may have a bright future as a film maker, 
but TWENTYFOURSEVEN lacks the focus and drive necessary for a 
breakthrough feature.  The picture may be about violence inside and 
outside of the ring, but RAGING BULL this isn't.</P>
