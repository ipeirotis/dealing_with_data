<P>     Not surprisingly, MEET THE PARENTS is being promoted as a film "from
the director of AUSTIN POWERS;" when you've got a connection to a $200
million film in Hollywood, you take advantage of it. It just strikes me as
an absurdity of the highest order to pump up Jay Roach for his POWERS 
oeuvre. They were Mike Myers films, plain and simple, and pretending
otherwise is like giving Tom Shadyac credit for the success of ACE
VENTURA, or Dennis Dugan for BIG DADDY. To his credit, Roach knew enough
to mostly get out of Myers' way, showing he understands how to take
advantage of a gifted comic performer's strengths. Let's not forget,
however, that this is also the director of MYSTERY, ALASKA -- not exactly
the second coming of Preston Sturges.</P>
<P>     In MEET THE PARENTS, Roach gets to oversee yet another gifted comic
performer, and once again the film is primarily effective to the extent
that it gets out of that performer's way. Ben Stiller plays Greg Focker, a
Chicago male nurse who's ready to pop the question to his girlfriend Pam
Byrnes (Teri Polo). But before he does, there's a key test to pass: Pam's
no-nonsense father Jack (Robert DeNiro). Greg has gotten an inkling that
Jack is a tough man to win over, yet he's optimistic when he and Pam head
to upstate New York for the weekend to attend the wedding of Pam's sister. 
And that's when Greg realizes that Jack may be an impossible man to win
over, with his every attempt to make things better inevitably making
things worse instead.</P>
<P>     With Woody Allen having migrated away from his trademark schlemiel
character in recent years, Ben Stiller has become cinema's reigning
champion of outsider anxiety as comedy. There's more of an undercurrent of
hostility to Stiller's on-screen persona, but he still makes has an
uncanny ability to make his characters' frustrations and awkward
situations hilarious. MEET THE PARENTS gives Stiller plenty of
opportunities to squirm -- notably when he concocts an impromptu
recollection about milking the family cat -- and his discomfort is almost
always good for a laugh. He also gets a great straight man to work with in
DeNiro, whose straight-faced portrayal of the over-protective Jack is just
the right counterpoint for Stiller's manic antics. If you're a Ben Stiller
fan, you'll probably be a MEET THE PARENTS fan.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, Stiller does have to struggle against an inconsistent
script and flaccid direction. Though MEET THE PARENTS is at least subtle
enough to avoid make Greg's antagonist an out-and-out villain, it's still
primarily a film of broad individual gags. The situations grow more
elaborate, and the set pieces more convoluted, but there's no natural
build-up to the comedy. Roach's direction misses the right rhythm both for
individual scenes (notably the domino effect after Greg unwittingly lets
the Byrnes' cat out of the house) and for the film as a whole. There's
never any sense that MEET THE PARENTS is building to a humorous crescendo
so much as it is doling out punch lines and pratfalls at regular 
intervals. Every possible situation comes to the expected worst-case
scenario for Greg, and the characters come to the expected epiphanies at
the expected times.</P>
<P>     That the film works in spite of the people behind the camera says a
lot for the people in front of the camera. The supporting players support
effectively; Owen Wilson, even underused as he is here, still adds an
off-beat edge to every scene he's in. MEET THE PARENTS is one of those
films where most of the laughs come from waiting for the protagonist's
next humiliation, and often such films are as nerve-wracking as they are
amusing. Stiller is simply so funny when he's sweating -- and so
determined not to be a victim even as he's being victimized -- that the
amusement manages to emerge triumphant. It's a shame that he's working
with a workmanlike director who cuts off scenes before they've reached
their zenith, but it's often the fate of brilliant comics that they can't
find brilliant directors to work with. Working with the likes of Mike
Myers and Ben Stiller is a smart career move for the Jay Roaches of the
cinema world. Even when the performers' gifts manage to emerge, the
reverse is rarely true.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 missed directions:  6.</PRE>
