<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Alan (TROUBLE IN MIND, CHOOSE ME, MODERNS) Rudolph's  off-beat film has
the look and feel of bad melodrama, using over-exaggerated action
sequences to spin a convoluted yarn (Maybe a parody) about twins, born
to a ballerina who had an affair with a European aristocrat and is
forced into giving them up for adoption when he wants no part of her.
They are separated at birth, taking different paths in life: Henry
Petosa (Matthew Modine) grows up to be a shy, nerdy, fearful, and
unambitious garage mechanic in his adoptive (he doesn't know that he's
adopted) father's (M. Emmett Walsh) garage, who spends his spare time
watching self-defense programs on TV and pining away for his best friend
Russell's (nervously played by Kevin J. O'Connor) emotionally insecure
sister, Beverly (Lara Flynn Boyle), who reads Emily Dickenson aloud to
herself. He modestly lives in a tenement that happens to be in a bad
neighborhood. The brother he doesn't know exists, is Freddy Ace, also
played by Modine, who is a small-time hood, ambitiously working himself
up the ladder of the protection racket run by a vicious hood, Mr. Paris
(Fred Ward), doing the driving and also doing a cold-blooded hit job for
the boss. He is always seen with a perfectly moussed-hairstyle, and is
married to a beautiful but shallow woman (Lori Singer), having two
children and living in a luxurious apartment; all these things are
status symbols, which show that he has come a long way from the
orphanage he was raised in.</P>
<P>An old bag lady, with a tattoo on her arm, saying "To my dearest
Helena," dies on the fictional city streets clutching a letter stating
that she is the mother of twins and that the father of the children left
$200,000 (it is now worth 4 million dollars) for them in a Swiss trust
fund that can only be accessed by the password "equinox." The title of
the film, as defined, will refer to the equality of the light and dark
sides during an equinox. This symbolizes the qualities the twins must
confront in their nature, which only Henry is able to do.</P>
<P>The letter is found by an ambitious hospital worker, Sonya Kirk
(uninterestingly played by Tyra), who aspires to be a writer and thinks
this will make a great story. She weaves this ambiguous tale or spoof,
or whatever it is, together. As all the quirky characters will somehow
fit into the story and by the end of the film, I guess, there is
supposed to be some hidden message as Henry stands alone, looking down
at the tremendous depths of the Grand Canyon.</P>
<P>There was also a ridiculous scene with a hooker named Rosie (Tomei), who
lives in Henry's tenement and is being abused by her pimp (Dudley). She
will service Henry as a payment for watching her baby. There was one
stupid line she said to him that made me laugh primarily because it was
so stupid, "You're not going to catch nothing from me but your breath."</P>
<P>In fact, the only enjoyment I derived from all the banal dialogue and
its embarrassing story (if it wasn't a parody, then it's a horrible
script, and if it is a parody, it doesn't work, the story is too
ambiguous) was the B- movie one-liners that kept coming throughout the
film. Since that's the only thing I liked about this film, I'll drop a
few of them on you: Freddy to another gangster, "Never miss a good
chance to shut up." One gangster talking to another, "I was so popular
in high school, everybody hated me." I'll mention two quotes Mr. Petosa
gives us from his vaudeville shtick he seemed to be doing for his
characterization, "If money didn't grow on trees, how come banks have so
many branches?" and "Chaste makes waste." Henry tritely says, "My whole
life seems to be taking place without me in it." Freddy, when asked if
he is happy, replies, "I'd be a lot happier with a million bucks and a
full tank of gas." Paris says to Freddy after he knocks off their
associate, Richie (Tate), "Richie had no brains, and he was stupid."
Beverly to Henry, which is the most pertinent line in the film, banal as
it is, "Your whole life is searching for one thing, and all that other
stuff just fades away."</P>
<P>I don't know what the story is supposed to mean; maybe its just a
search-for-identity kind of film; maybe its an updated fairytale about
"The Prince and the Pauper," as one critic suggests. But I found it to
be muddled, unfunny, and the acting is so lame, especially Matthew
Modine's overacting, that it is almost unbearable to watch. But I got a
kick out of those stupid one-liners from all the zanies trying so hard
to be to be zany, and there was something intangible about the film that
made you keep watching it, hoping there was something there that you
missed seeing. So, at least, it's an original film; a passable one, at
that, with a lot of possibility to it; and, it is done in the bizarre
auteur style this filmmaker likes to operate in.</P>
