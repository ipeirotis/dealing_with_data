<P>     This is what happens when someone takes what might have been a
moderately-entertaining television Christmas special and tries to adapt
it for the big screen.  THE SANTA CLAUSE isn't an unmitigated disaster,
but it's also a whole lot less impressive than it could be.  The
release date--six weeks in advance of the actual holiday--should be
reason enough for skepticism.  Was this perhaps an attempt to beat John
Hughes' MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET to the theaters?</P>
<P>     The previews would lead the average viewer to expect a funny romp
through the misadventures of an average man trying to cope with his
unexpected transformation into Santa Claus.  Take away the "funny"
part, and that describes roughly half of the movie.  The rest deals
with custody hearings, police chases, and other assorted nonsense which
serves only to bog down a story that is thin to begin with.</P>
<P>     On Christmas Eve, Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) hears a noise on the
roof.  Suspecting a prowler, he goes outside, only to surprise Santa
"in the act."  Losing his balance, the big man falls off the roof and
ends up dead at Scott's feet.  The significance of the moment isn't
lost on young Charlie Calvin (Eric Lloyd), who accuses his father of
killing Santa.</P>
<P>     Following the unfortunate turn of events, Santa's body disappears,
leaving behind his suit and a calling card: "If anything happens to
me, put on the suit."  So, with a little prodding from Charlie, Scott
complies, and finds the rest of his night spent doing Santa's yearly
rounds.  It isn't until he gets to the North Pole that he learns there
was some small print on the card:  "In putting on this suit and
entering the sleigh, the wearer waives any and all rights to previous
identity, real or implied and fully accepts the duties and
responsibilities of Santa Claus until such time that wearer becomes
unable to do so either by accident or design."  In effect, Scott Calvin
has become Santa Claus.</P>
<P>     THE SANTA CLAUSE is a low brow version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL meets
MIRACLE AT 34TH STREET, a children's movie that a portion of the adult
population will find tolerable.  The scenes depicting Scott's
metamorphosis are often clever, but they get swamped by extraneous
subplots and dumb jokes.  The special effects are good enough to hold
the story together, but there's nothing innovative or eye-opening.  A
similar comment can be made about the makeup job which transforms the
lanky toy designer into his corpulent alter ego.</P>
<P>     Tim Allen is more of a personality than an actor, and it shows
frequently during the course of THE SANTA CLAUSE.  While he may be
funny in a half-hour sitcom, Allen doesn't do nearly as well without
the laugh track.  This film is also not blessed with a particularly
effective child actor in Eric Lloyd, who whines his way unconvincingly
through the role.</P>
<P>     There's nothing offensive or especially mean-spirited about THE
SANTA CLAUSE, as might be expected from a Disney release.  However,
there should be more to a family movie than these "wholesome"
qualities--and this film isn't able to deliver them.  Tim Allen's movie
is in need of something his TV show is very familiar with:
improvement.</P>
