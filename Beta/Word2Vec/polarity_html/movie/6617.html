<P>     THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT is such an intriguing and entertaining
film biography that it is almost a shame that it had to have a "message."
Milos Forman's study of "Hustler" magazine publisher Larry Flynt is an
examination of the challenge of accepting potentially offensive material
as protected speech under the Constitution, and as such it is not in the
same class as solemnly liberal films which congratulate themselves for
championing radical notions like "racism is a bad thing."  Still, there is
a slickness to the way Flynt's legal battles are portrayed which makes it
too easy to choose sides.  When the film focuses on Flynt as a character
and on his relationships, THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT soars.  When Flynt
becomes an icon, it slips.</P>
<P>     The film opens in 1952 -- with young Larry and his brother Jimmy
selling moonshine in Kentucky -- then flashes forward twenty years to find
Larry (Woody Harrelson) and Jimmy (Woody's real-life brother Brett
Harrelson) selling a different vice.  Their Ohio-based Hustler strip bar
is only barely staying afloat, however, and Larry starts up a glossy
newsletter to help promote the club.  The newsletter unexpectedly takes on
a life of its own, and "Hustler" is born, much to the consternation of
conservative civic leaders.  In 1977, Flynt is arrested for selling
pornography, and takes on young civil rights attorney Alan Isaacman
(Edward Norton) for his defense.  Though he ultimately wins his first
case, there always seems to be another one close behind, as Flynt becomes
a favored target for anti-pornography legal action.  His legal troubles
are only part of his life's challenges, though, as a would-be assassin's
bullet paralyzes him and his troubled wife Althea (Courtney Love)
struggles with her own demons.</P>
<P>     Screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski also wrote the
script for Tim Burton's ED WOOD, and FLYNT demonstrates once again that
they have a marvelous sense for crafting structure out of eccentricity.
Flynt is rendered variously as a libertine capitalist selling what America
is buying, as a half-hearted Christian convert and as a bitter,
unpredictable paraplegic, yet every facet of his character becomes part of
a fascinating whole in Woody Harrelson's performance.  It is a dynamic
piece of acting:  sly and blisteringly funny one moment, quiet and
emotional the next.  He is brought most fully to life in both respects
through his interactions with the cast's other two stand-outs, Edward
Norton and Courtney Love.  It has taken Norton only a year to become one
of the most impressive young actors in film, and he is top-notch as the
attorney and unlikely friend who tries to rein in Flynt.  Love, meanwhile,
simply gives a clinic in creating a complex character.  She is dazzling
even as Althea dissolves in a losing battle with AIDS, and she appears not
at all concerned over whether or not the audience likes her.  Few actors
can muster that kind of fearlessness.</P>
<P>     THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT is frequently hilarious as it explores the
characters' relationships and challenging in its reluctance to offer
embraceable heroes.  When it hits the courtrooms, the lines become more
clearly drawn, to the film's detriment.  The self-aggrandizing
pornographer is too easy to side with when opposed by a villainous judge,
or such obvious symbols of hypocrisy as savings and loan magnate/
soon-to-be felon Charles Keating (James Cromwell); Jerry Falwell (Richard
Paul), whose libel suit becomes the basis for Flynt's Supreme Court
challenge, is rendered similarly as a scowling buffoon.  Giving Flynt's
enemies a face which is easy to laugh at diffuses the point of the film
when it is no longer "the people" who are versus Flynt, but simply some
nasty stuffed shirts.  Flynt's speech is deserving of protection not
because he is better than his accusers, but because it shouldn't matter
who is better; when Flynt tells reporters that a victory for him would be
important because he is "the worst," it is fairly obvious that Alexander,
Karaszewski and Forman don't agree.</P>
<P>     All the legal wranglings come to a thrilling conclusion, however, in
what may be the best courtroom scene I have ever seen.  As Isaacson argues
Flynt's case before the Supreme Court, the courtroom becomes an
opportunity not for sermons, but for the exchange of ideas.  At that
moment, the issues at the heart of THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT matter
profoundly, with Norton's passionate defense shattering the earlier
dichotomies of right vs. wrong.  It made me more disappointed in an
earlier scene in which Flynt gives a sincere speech to civil libertarians
which is presented without a hint of irony.  Larry Flynt, manic
smut-peddler, makes for a much more compelling protagonist than Larry
Flynt, First Amendment hero.</P>
