<P>     James Merendino's SLC PUNK! has something deep and insightful to say
about the nature of youthful rebellion.  Sort of.  Maybe.  I think.  It's
sort of hard to tell through all the bombast of Merendino's hyperactive
period piece, which tries to be a sort of nostalgic BREAKFAST CLUB for the
Dead Kennedys set but misses the point entirely.  It's one thing to make a
film about teens grousing over the sell-outs of adulthood and the trials
of coping with societal expectations, and target it at the teens
themselves; it's quite another to make such a film and target it at those
who've already been through that melodramatic wringer.  The simple
enjoyment that might have come from the time and the tunes instead turns
into a 90 minute wait for the characters to get a clue.</P>
<P>     Our tour guide through SLC PUNK! is Stevo (Matthew Lillard), who --
along with his best friend Heroin Bob (Michael Goorjian) -- is one of the
few true punks in the capital of conservative Utah during the conservative
Reagan era circa 1985.  The tour consists largely of an anthropological
dig through Stevo and Bob's twisted clique, which includes an
independently wealthy and extremely paranoid drug dealer (Til Schweiger),
the lads' respective ladyfriends (Jennifer Lien and Annabeth Gish), and an
acid casualty (Devon Sawa).  Along the way we learn about the various
sub-categories of Salt Lake City youth, the influence of Stevo's 60s
radical-turned-yuppie father (Christopher McDonald), and where to go for
real beer when you need it.</P>
<P>     Like many an independent comedy, SLC PUNK! has enough frantic energy
to guarantee at least a few belly laughs -- notably during Stevo's spin
through a party describing the various sub-plots in action, and a scene
showing our protagonists as pre-punk, "Dungeons and Dragons"-obsessed
middle-schoolers.  Also like many an independent comedy, it often has
nothing _but_ frantic energy.  For every decent gag or clever insight, you
can count on at least two or three self-indulgent uses of direct address
to the camera in which Stevo rails about religious oppression or the
plague of poseurs (i.e., those who son the garb without walking the walk).
Scenes which I'm assuming should come off as either amusing or
wise-beyond-his-years instead come off as merely damp; if spittle were
diamonds, Matthew Lillard's performance would surely be a piece of comic
jewelry fit for a princess.  Once again, a film-maker's attempt to connect
with the audience through narration becomes a lazy failure.</P>
<P>     SLC PUNK! tries to score its major profundity points when Stevo is
hit by the bombshell that rebellious youth are just conformists of a
different kind.  Well, you can file that one under "d" for "duh;" Stevo's
revelation is one with which any audience member over the age of 25 will
already be quite familiar.  It's that kind of pseudo-wisdom that makes SLC
PUNK! far more tiresome than a film built around devotion to the Ramones
should have been.  When tragedy strikes one of the film's significant
characters late in the film, and Merendino tries to play it as a genuine
tragedy, you realize he hasn't remotely earned an emotional response.  SLC
PUNK! blasts through its set pieces with little film-making prowess, then
expects to tie it all together by having Stevo blubber away at misspent
youth.  Poseurs, indeed.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 bunk rockers:  4.</PRE>
