(Aunt Morag), 1993-Australia)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The tune emanating from The Piano is a passionate one, coming forth on a
desolate New Zealand coastline, far removed from European culture, where
a piano is seen as something peculiar to possess in such a backward area
of the world. It is used symbolically to represent the works of
civilization that can soothe the savage beast, if the beast is lonely
and willing to listen to something he usually doesn't listen to.</P>
<P>The underlying premise of the film is one of communication or lack of it
in a world that can be cold, and of how easy it is to never find love in
such a world. The coastline is a place where the sky and sea are
dismally gray, and it rains all the time; where the native Maoris, with
their tattooed faces, and the white settlers of this nineteenth century
tale are living in a marshy forest, with the settlers trying to live by
the rules they were accustomed to in Europe, but are now faced with
muddy roads and squalid living conditions, making their life almost
unbearable; and to top that off, the two diverse groups seem unable to
see each other's point of view, as the Maoris mock the settlers under
their breath and the settlers treat the natives as if they were
children.</P>
<P>It is a place where the characters either can't talk (the bride), or
can't listen (the new husband), or are spiteful (the daughter), in a
film that unrelentingly studies the affects of erotic yearnings in a
restrictive society... And who can forget the powerful image it leaves
the viewer, of the piano left abandoned in its crate against the forlorn
backdrop of the rushing surf and the desolate beach!</P>
<P>Ada (Holly) is a young mute in her early thirties, for some inexplicable
reason, she has not been able to talk since she was 6 years old. Her
voiceover says, "This is not the sound of my voice you are hearing; it
is the sound of my mind."She is seen in the film's opening arriving in
New Zealand by boat and then being rowed by canoe ashore, coming all the
way from her native Scotland for an arranged mail-order marriage at her
father's insistence. She is accompanied by her 8 year old daughter Flora
(Paquin), as she awaits on the beach with all her possessions to meet
her unseen British emigrant husband Stewart (Neill), who is trying to
make a go of it by cultivating the land in this bush country.The only
two things she cares about in life are with her on the beach: her
daughter and her piano.</P>
<P>The contradiction of a deaf mute playing music, is underscored by the
tremendous joyous feeling that it exudes in Ada, as it is her only real
contact with the world, and the piano is something that this fiercely
proud woman cannot live without.</P>
<P>She is soon met by the anxious groom, seen trying to comb his unruly
hair, but who doesn't have the presence of mind to give the ladies a
kindly welcome, instead orders the Maoris accompanying him to start
bringing all the luggage with them except for the piano. He is not
listening to his new bride who writes him anxious notes and talks in a
hand sign language to her daughter who translates, as she urgently tells
him the piano is hers and she must keep it, even, above her other
worldly possessions. But her insensitive and demanding husband, who
actually wishes for a woman who is totally mute, one who does not even
play the piano, tells her the piano can't be taken with them on their
long trek to the house because it is too heavy for the Maori laborers to
carry, and he refuses to return for it at a later date. Also at the
beach, watching these precedings, is a coarse-looking white man gone
native, tattooing his face Maori style, saying nothing about what he
sees taking place. The name of this ex-whaler now laborer, is Baines
(Keitel).</P>
<P>The illiterate Baines is overtaken with joy, after hearing Ada play the
piano when she  returned to the beach. She is despondent about her
marriage and refuses to offer her shy husband any affection, and thusly
plays her heart out in the only way she knows how to communicate her
feelings. Baines, thereby, decides to make a deal with Stewart for the
piano, offering him some land for it, if he can also receive piano
lessons from his wife. When the lessons begin, he tells Ada that he
wants to receive sexual favors from her. He starts off slowly, by
lifting up her skirt when she plays, and will eventually take her into
his bedroom. In return, after a series of such sexual encounters, adding
up to the number of black keys there are, the piano will go back to her.
That makes the relationship that develops between the two seem
devilishly strange. These scenes are very powerful and surprisingly
enough come across as being sensual, even if, the proposal as put-forth,
at first, seemed to be an obvious power-play against a hapless victim.
But Campion knows how to draw out the passions from these scenes and
make this unlikely romance between these opposites bloom. It all seems
plausible because their physical wants are motivating them to act this
way toward each other. In the beginning, she pretends to be repulsed by
him, but eventually she warms up to him, in fact, she looks forward to
the lessons. She does all the playing while he listens, as the music
gives off the vibes she wants to communicate. All that he knows, is that
he just wants her physically, that he feels her inside his gut; and,
that he turns out to be a more sensitive person than at first thought
possible, is precisely what gives impetus to this Gothic romance.</P>
<P>Possibly the most complex character in the story, is the little girl,
who is shown to be cute as a button, a seemingly loyal companion of her
mother, an able liar, and a bit of a prude. But on the spur of the
moment, one day, she fails to follow her mother's orders to deliver a
message to Baines- someone her husband has now forbidden her to see- and
does something that turns out to be devastating, betraying her mother by
impishly delivering the message to Stewart instead of Baines, knowing
exactly what she is doing, but somewhat astonished, to her regret, about
what tragedy this brings about for her mother.</P>
<P>Michael Nyman's astonishing score, performed by Holly Hunter herself,
expresses the explosive mood of this extraordinary visionary film. A
film whose silence and music speaks for itself as an apt way of
communicating. The two men want Ada, even though each of them is not
really suited for her, as one represents a cold and frustrated civilized
society, while the other is able to express the feelings he has inside
himself without being uptight about it, just like the natives of the
culture he adopted are able to so easily do.</P>
<P>With Stewart, embroiled in jealousy, fighting off his loneliness and
repressions, unable to be a warm person and fulfill his marriage duties
properly, he is seen as a lost soul, out of his elements in a wild
country he can't even begin to fathom. He is stuck in the trap he built
for himself, struggling to work the land and tame his restless soul. Sam
Neill is stupendous as the lost soul wrestling with his passions. Harvey
Keitel, masking a NYC accent by talking in some kind of Maori pigeon
tongue, is ably cast as the brooding lover who turns out to have a
gentle soul, something this loner must have felt in his heart for a long
time but now emerges inside him and gives the film a certain kind of raw
power to it. Anna Paquin, in my opinion, is the best surprise in the
film, the one with the most difficult role, and the one with the biggest
part in the film. What makes it all the more amazing is that she is a
mere child, asked to play a part on equal footing with all the
accomplished actors she is surrounded by. Holly Hunter, with a gaunt
ash-striken face, is mesmorizing in a role that she emotionally is in
perfect harmony with. Her performance is the key one; it is the one that
propels the film to give it its needed air of desperation and to outline
the passionate struggle between just surviving and living for love. She
is strangely rejuvenated by the naturalism and lack of inhibitions found
in this backward place and the passion she feels from Baines, as it
seeps into her repressed soul and transforms her.</P>
<P>The film is brought slowly together by Jane Campion's masterful
direction, whose understanding of the erotic desires of the characters
is right on the mark, with the result being an original and haunting
film, a story that grew more intensively disturbing for me the longer I
thought about it. Stuart Dryburgh's camera captures the internal mood of
the characters, as well as the monotonous beauty and the oppressive
reality of the countryside. But the film misses the mark, at times, as
the two main characters, Stewart and Baines, despite their fine
performances, are nevertheless too one-dimensional to give the film more
of an impact. It seems as if this is Ada's story to tell and no one
else's. This is a film, nevertheless, that will justifiably garner great
interest because of her very trying performance.</P>
