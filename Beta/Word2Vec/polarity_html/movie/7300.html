<P>     For what it's worth, I suppose I learned something from LOVE AND
OTHER CATASTROPHES:  romantic comedies can be just as predictable and
uninspired in Australia as in the U.S.  If attractive, likeable actors and
a non-threatening lightness of tone count for anything -- and heaven knows
that they can -- LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES may find an audience
receptive to its nominal charms.  I suspect audiences are more likely to
discover that it has absolutely nothing new to say, and that its
moderately eccentric/neurotic characters are very familiar.  LOVE AND
OTHER CATASTROPHES is a ride on flat, straight ground to nowhere in
particular.</P>
<P>     The plot follows a day in the life of five Australian university
students coping with various minor dilemmas.  Mia (Frances O'Connor), a
flighty lesbian, is forced to navigate a bureaucratic obstacle course to
change programs, on the same day she is struggling with commitment issues
with her girlfriend Danni (Radha Mitchell).  Mia's roommate Alice (Alice
Garner) is trying to complete her film studies thesis on Doris Day as
feminist icon, while pining from afar for a notorious womanizer named Ari
(Matthew Dytkynski).  Meanwhile, medical student Michael (Matt Day)
responds to Mia and Alice's ad for a third roommate, unaware that Alice is
the coffee shop clerk to whom he is attracted.</P>
<P>     There is a certain energy to LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES which makes
it hard to dislike actively.  Director/co-writer Emma-Kate Croghan keeps
things moving at a brisk clip, and provides at least a couple of amusing
sequences; the best involves Mia racing from place to place trying to find
someone to approve her change of program before the deadline at the end of
the day, dealing with dilemmas like the inconvenient death of her advisor.
The cast is uniformly appealing, and unlike may romantic larks about young
people, the characters never start to grate on your nerves with their
insecurities and crises.  All things considered, these five seem pretty
well-adjusted.</P>
<P>     So much for the damning with faint praise.  The fact is that LOVE AND
OTHER CATASTROPHES is a 76-minute movie which takes forever to end.  As
nice as the characters are, most of them never progress beyond a single
dimension.  Alice is the most complex character, a perfectionist whose
impossibly high standards for a significant other take a back seat to some
animal lust for Ari, but Croghan and her co-writers never explore that
dynamic; it's just a blip on Alice's emotional radar which quickly
vanishes.  The characters march with such ease toward their respective
happy endings that there is not a moment of tension, and it's all so
shallow that you may forget every relationship half an hour after
watching.  Even the very 90s twist of making one of the couples lesbian
can't generate much spark.  A couple without chemistry is a couple without
chemistry, gay or straight.</P>
<P>     Among the more perplexing aspects of LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES are
Croghan's few attempts at idiosyncrasy, all of which fall flat.  A
farcical scene of film students dressed like their idols (Quentin
Tarantino, Woody Allen, etc.) seems wildly out of place, and the burnt
orange cinematography makes you wonder whether Don Simpson and Jerry
Bruckheimer hijacked the production somewhere along the line.  I suppose
Croghan had to do something to spice up the material, but it might have
been a better idea to write a complete script, develop the characters and
their relationships, _then_ put together a good-looking cast of
characters.  Frances O'Connor's bright smile and Matt Day's geeky
handsomeness can buy few minutes of good will, but sooner or later people
have to do something vaguely interesting.  LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES
isn't a catastrophe; it's just the kind of aimlessly frothy romantic
comedies America has churned out a hundred times before.  Only the accents
have been changed to distinguish the guilty.</P>
