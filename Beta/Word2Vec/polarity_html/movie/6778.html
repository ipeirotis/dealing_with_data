<P>     Call 911 for the Cliche Police if you must, but the eyes are the
window to the soul.  The finest actors working in films are those who can
command the screen with a gaze:  Paul Newman, Ralph Fiennes, Anthony
Hopkins, Morgan Freeman.  You look at these men on screen and you can tell
without them saying a word that there is something going on in their
minds, that the characters they play are real human beings.  We will never
have a chance to discover if Tupac Shakur could have been a great actor,
but he had that unique quality in his eyes.  In GRIDLOCK'd, an oddly
effective combination of gritty drama and social satire, Shakur and his
co-star Tim Roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch
through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry.</P>
<P>     Shakur and Roth play Ezekiel "Spoon" Whitmore and Alexander "Stretch"
Rome, two Detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio, an apartment
and a drug addiction with Cookie (Thandie Newton).  When a New Year's Eve
party ends with Cookie comatose after a drug overdose, Spoon and Stretch
begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time.  They soon make a New
Year's resolution to get into rehab, but that proves to be easier said
than done.  As though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough,
Spoon and Stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road
block of bureaucracy, confusion and red tape.  The government might be the
least of their obstacles, however, as they find themselves suspects in the
murder of a drug dealer, and on the run from a nasty thug (Vondie Curtis
Hall).</P>
<P>     In order for you to buy into GRIDLOCK'd at all, you have to accept it
as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism; unless Spoon and
Stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in
Cookie, they are going to government offices on New Year's day, in which
case they should be thankful they get any help at all.  GRIDLOCK'd may
actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban
odyssey, 1991's FALLING DOWN, which found a besieged middle class white
male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through 
inner city Los Angeles.  In FALLING DOWN, Michael Douglas' D-FENS (the
character's personalized license plate, echoed in GRIDLOCK'd by the drug
lord D-REPER's plates) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at
McDonald's; in GRIDLOCK'd, Spoon and Stretch are unarmed against the
demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center.  And where
the unhinged D-FENS became a heroic surrogate for audiences,
writer/director Vondie Curtis Hall refuses to let Spoon and Stretch off
the hook for their own part in the situation.  One bureaucrat responds to
a tirade from Stretch with the question, "Do you expect the world to
stop...just because you picked _today_ to clean up?"  The world in
GRIDLOCK'd is just as frustrating as the world in FALLING DOWN, but the
cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time.</P>
<P>     Hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from The
System, but perhaps not enough of them.  A significant chunk of GRIDLOCK'd
is devoted to Spoon and Stretch's flight from D-REPER and from the police,
and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments.  In one
scene, Stretch scares off D-REPER by getting chummy with a police officer;
another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes
in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which
shows their pictures.  The entire sequence of events seems designed merely
as an excuse to get Spoon and Stretch running, while the other primary
plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time.  Hall
also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to
the day before the film's main events, perhaps making a particular effort
to point out the talent the characters are wasting through
self-destructive behavior.</P>
<P>     Oh, the irony of it.  Tupac Shakur made a career in music and movies
playing the hard case, and living the life to back it up.  In GRIDLOCK'd,
Shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his
life could go to know that it scares him.  Spoon is an idea for a
character at best as written by Hall, but Shakur displays an intelligence
and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction.  Mostly it comes
through those eyes, eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from
the infamous gangsta.  It is Spoon who plays conscience to Stretch's pure
appetite, and Roth plays Stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness (he
reveals that he is HIV positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again)
which is as much an obstacle to Spoon's goal as any agency or enemy.
GRIDLOCK'd's most cruelly comic scene finds Stretch "helping" Spoon get
into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket
knife, and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps
has slowly drained the life out of him.  With friends like that, Spoon
doesn't need enemies, and Shakur looks at Stretch with the tired eyes of a
man who has seen too much.  The tragedy now is that we won't get more
chances to see those eyes again.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 drug traffic jams:  7.</PRE>
