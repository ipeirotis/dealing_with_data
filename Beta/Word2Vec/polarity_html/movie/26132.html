<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Michael Dinner's geezer mobster comedy has a funny premise but falters
on the execution part, as the yuks come, but not often enough to sustain
the predictability and staleness about the film. The film tried hard to
be funny and genial, but this idea for a film has been done too often in
recent times to appear fresh. Whatever went wrong, must be blamed on the
poor direction and poor script. The most unbearable part of the film for
me, was having to listen to Richard Dreyfuss' voiceover, which was
sprinkled with ethnic slang expressions such as "mooks," "fahzools," and
"fuhgeddaboudits," as he droned on in a nasal voice throughout, telling
about the four wiseguys who gew up together in New Jersey and who are
now unhappily retired in Miami Beach. This film needed such an intensive
voiceover like I need to have sand kicked in my face at the beach, it
just ruined the flow of the story and prevented the story from being a
movie experience rather than an exercise in trying to cover up the
film's inability to tell a story.</P>
<P>The four senior citizens featured were embellezers, arsonists,
enforcers, and lower echelon mob types, who are now living in a South
Beach hotel for the elderly, where they hunt for bingo games, a free cup
of a soup, and act geriatric like all the other seniors in their golden
years down here do. But things are changing since Madonna mentioned it
as a hip spot and the yuppies are coming around to gentrify it, as the
old timers are dying out and being replaced by the young. The four aging
retired mobsters, with three of them having colorful nicknames that
depict their emotional temperaments -- Bobby Bartellemeo (Richard
Dreyfuss), Joey "Bats" Pistella (Burt Reynolds), Mike "The Brick"
Donatelli (Dan Hedaya) and Tony "Mouth" Donato (Seymour Cassel) -- all
try to earn some extra money by working at a regular job for the first
time in their life. The only one to get any satisfaction from his job is
The Brick, who works in the morgue dressing the dead up before they
depart the earth.</P>
<P>The wiseguys don't have the money to keep up with their rising rent
payments and they are seen seething, as they sit on the hotel's
streetside porch and listen to the passers-by say that they expect them
to die soon. The hotel management just wants to get them out so that
they can really raise the rent sky high for their ocean view apartment.
So they come up with a cockeyed plan, cooked up by the volatile Bats.
When he gets knocked unconscious, that is the only way he can think up
such plans, which becomes a running gag throughout the movie. The plan
is to get a body from the morgue and then shoot the dead body to make it
look like a gangland execution and then dump it in the lobby of their
hotel. This way the public will consider the hotel a dangerous place to
live and their rent will go down, as no one will want to live there.</P>
<P>The plan works and they get the desired outcome, but for one problem,
the dead man's head they blew off was the senile nursing home resident
who is the father of a vicious Hispanic drug lord (Miguel Sandoval),
who's determined to get his revenge on those who did this to his father.
This results in a couple of the drug lord's enemies turning up dead. As
the police think they have a full-scale drug war on their hands, they
send two detectives to talk to the four old-timers and warn them to be
careful.</P>
<P>This turns out to be a coincidence, since Bobby, the brains of the four
wiseguys, moved to the Miami area primarily because he wants to locate
his missing daughter. She was taken there by her mother, who divorced
him when he did some prison time and he never was able to locate her
again. Ironically, the wiseguy's daughter turns out to be one of the
detectives investigating the crime, Olivia Neal (Carrie-Anne Moss).</P>
<P>Another running gag is that The Mouth never talks much, he is only
interested in chasing girls. But when he has sex with his hooker friend,
the busty Ferris Lowenstein (Jennifer Tilly), he starts talking nonstop.
He thereby tells Ferris of the hit, and she then turns around and
blackmails the boys. She tells them that she won't tell the drug lord
what happened if they whack her rich step-mother Pepper Lowenstein
(Kazan), whereby she will collect the insurance money.</P>
<P>The film keeps adding on sub-plots and the comedy keeps getting stifled
with the added weight of the new sub-plots. It isn't enough to make the
four of them out to be mobsters, but they also must now be deemed as
good guys, so the film goes to unneeded lengths to show how wonderful
they are. They can't kill Pepper, so they fake her death. But she lives
next to the drug lord, and they burn down by mistake his house along
with hers. Meanwhile the detective partners, Olivia and her
ex-boyfriend, the shifty-eyed Steve (Jeremy Piven), can't get back
together anymore because she doesn't trust him, but they still work
together. Their relationship gets woven into the ongoing story, further
filling the story with unnecessary fodder.</P>
<P>The director had a barrage of proven comic material to work with, an
able cast (except for Burt Reynolds-he was terribly miscast), yet the
film falls flat on its face. Everything about it seemed like a mistaken
pratfall. The comic timing was off, the story sagged, and the characters
had nothing up their sleeves but old jokes and comedy routines that
weren't even funny most of the time, ones that seemed out of place.
Laine Kazan could flatten a kreplach with this old joke about Tilley's
father, as she blurts out, "It would kill her father if he knew what she
was doing to me, that is, if he weren't already dead." With yuks like
that, all I can say is "oy gevalt," give me a break, get some fresh
material already!</P>
<P>For those who are film buffs, there is one throwaway scene to kvell on,
where the director pays homage to Martin Scorsese's GoodFellas, as the
wiseguys get ripped off by an Hispanic kitchen worker, as he gets bribe
money from them for letting them sneak through his deli's kitchen so the
boys can get served the early-bird special, otherwise they would be
stuck waiting outside on a long line. It might have been the funniest
scene of the film, just to see their silly expressions as he leads them
out a back door onto the street. I also left the theater by way of the
rear door, and I also had a look of consternation on my face, wondering
how easy it would have been to make this a much better film with just a
little better effort in working the script.</P>
