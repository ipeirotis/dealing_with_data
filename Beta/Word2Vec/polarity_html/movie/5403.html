<P>     New York Knicks fans, still smarting from a lackluster season and 
second-round playoff ejection, may find some solace in EDDIE, a fantasy 
for Big Apple NBA fans.  Just about everyone else is likely to find this 
smug, self-congratulatory, moronic comedy unbearable.  Whoopi Goldberg 
doesn't exactly have a sterling track record, but this particular 
travesty resembles a pile left by the runaway elephant in MADE IN 
AMERICA.  </P>
<P>     Whoopi plays Eddie Franklin, a rabid Knicks fan (very much in the 
mold of the Celtics fans from the infinitely better CELTIC PRIDE).  She 
sits high in the cheap seats at Madison Square Garden, yelling epithets 
at the beleaguered coach (Dennis Farina, doing a Pat Riley imitation).  
By day, Eddie is a limo driver, and, when one of her pickups turns out 
to be Wild Bill Burgess (Frank Langella), the Knicks' new owner, she 
deluges him with unsolicited advice.  Bill is so impressed by her that, 
when he sees her at a game one night, he rigs an "honorary coach" 
contest so that she wins.  When the fans react with unbridled enthusiasm 
to her antics, Bill goads the current coach into resigning, then hires 
Eddie as the replacement.  And, of course, the sorry Knicks start to get 
better just as the season winds down.</P>
<P>     Eddie has inherited a team of talented problem players, so, 
according to formula, she sets out winning their trust and turning them 
around.  She reunites one with his wife, learns Russian to communicate 
with another, and brings in a third one's mom for an inspirational pep-
talk.  The results?  Well, when it comes to the big game, the oaf who 
can't plant his feet suddenly grows roots and the superstar who never 
passes treats the ball like a hot potato.  There's a bit of contrived 
melodrama at the end that tries to fake the audience into thinking that 
the result of the game might be in doubt, but we know better.</P>
<P>     EDDIE tries to be a little different by introducing a sub-theme 
involving the arrogant self-absorption of today's athletes.  One player 
haughtily ignores a kid's request for an autograph; another won't 
practice because he's involved in a photo shoot for a rap album cover.  
This topic is a good launching pad for satire, but EDDIE does nothing 
with it.  It's just a plot device cooked up by one of the six credited 
screenwriters.  (When has a script written by so many been any good?)</P>
<P>     The character of Eddie is one of the film's worst miscalculations.  
We're supposed to like her, but, with Goldberg exhibiting all the loud, 
loutish arrogance of the stereotypical Knicks fan, we end up wishing for 
her downfall.  Quite a few past and current NBA players (Walt Frazier, 
John Salley, Dwayne Schintzius, and Dennis Rodman) make appearances, but 
their (thankfully) limited exposure does little more than prove that 
they're considerably more effective on court than on screen.</P>
<P>     Those offended by the rampant commercialism of motion pictures 
(Disney and its subsidiaries are particularly guilty of this) will find 
much in EDDIE to raise their ire.  Huge chunks of the film function as 
glorified commercials for ESPN (including a completely unnecessary cameo 
by Chris Berman) and New York's clear-channel WFAN radio.  </P>
<P>     There are a couple of clever moments in EDDIE, such as a scene 
where a player offers a scientifically accurate definition of a black 
hole (this echoes the "civilized" Right Guard commercials), but this 
film offers very few laughs.  It's a dull, stale affair with 
suspenseless game sequences, humorless jokes, and pathetic drama.  In 
short, unless you're craving a Knicks fantasy triumph, EDDIE is one 
summer movie to stay far away from.</P>
