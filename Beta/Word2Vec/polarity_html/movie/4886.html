<P>     Richard Pearce's A FAMILY THING is a pleasant, if not especially 
groundbreaking, motion picture that takes the "buddy movie" concept a 
step forward by introducing themes of race relations and kinship.  The 
film has more to say than might be initially obvious from the seemingly-
straightforward script, which was written by ONE FALSE MOVE scribes 
Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson.  All the topics presented on an 
intimate level are equally applicable to society as a whole, which has 
become more sensitive to issues of skin color than those of basic 
humanity.</P>
<P>     If you thought Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito made strange 
brothers, how about Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones?  A FAMILY 
THING's premise is that Duvall's character, Earl Pilcher, has been 
raised as the son of white parents, even though his real mother was 
black.  After the death of the woman he called "Mom", Earl learns about 
his true heritage, and heads north to Chicago to meet his half-brother, 
Raymond (Jones).  However, Ray is less than pleased to see Earl, because 
he associates his white sibling with tragedy.  His mother died giving 
birth to Earl, and Ray has nursed this bitterness for more than sixty 
years.</P>
<P>     For Earl, the challenge is putting aside the bigotry bred into him 
by his rural Arkansas environment.  Learning the truth about his mother 
forces him to abandon his black-and-white perceptions.  As A FAMILY 
THING chronicles one man's gradual acceptance of himself, it reminds us 
that skin color is an artificial, not a natural, barrier.  After meeting 
Ray, Earl realizes that intolerance is the product of ignorance, and, 
when it comes down to it, he and his black brother aren't fundamentally 
very different.</P>
<P>     One character central to bringing Earl and Ray together is their 
blind aunt, played brilliantly by scene-stealing Irma P. Hall.  In Aunt 
T's words, she doesn't "have the blessing of being able to separate 
people by looking at them."  So what if Earl's skin is lighter than 
Ray's -- that doesn't change their shared parentage.  She recognizes 
that the rift between the brothers is carved out of pride and 
stubbornness, and decides that it's her job to bridge it.  To that end, 
she forces Ray to stop blaming Earl for his mother's death while 
encouraging Earl to embrace his heritage.  Gradually for both men, 
stereotyping gives way to understanding, and understanding to 
brotherhood.</P>
<P>     Most of A FAMILY THING is devoted to Earl and Ray's struggles to 
reach common ground.  The usual "mismatched buddy" film conventions are 
present:  initial resentment and dislike that leads to a physical 
confrontation, followed by bonding and grudging admiration that grows 
into genuine affection.  With actors of Duvall and Jones' caliber, 
however, such formulas attain a higher-than-ordinary level.  Despite its 
good intentions, A FAMILY THING could easily have been a mediocre drama, 
but the excellent performances elevate the film considerably.</P>
<P>     Several scenes are over-the-top, and the character of Ray's son, 
Virgil (Michael Beach), is woefully underdeveloped (the result of 
editing choices), but, overall, this film is an agreeable exploration of 
what it means to be part of a family.  Much like THE BIRDCAGE, although 
without that film's comic excesses, A FAMILY THING isn't just about 
accepting one's circumstances, but embracing them.  The actors, playing 
characters it's easy to sympathize with, bring the story alive.  Because 
Duvall and Jones establish a successful rapport, A FAMILY THING has an 
unexpectedly strong emotional resonance, and that's a key reason why 
viewers are likely to leave this movie satisfied.  </P>
