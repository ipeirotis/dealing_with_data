<PRE>                                 TALL TALE
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     "Just 'cause it's a tall tale don't mean it ain't true," is the
wisdom imparted by father Jonas Hackett (Stephen Lang) to his son
Daniel (Nick Stahl).  But Daniel is a skeptic.  He has his father's
tall tales committed to memory, but has grown tired of hearing them.
It's "The American West in 1905," and although horseless carriages are
intruding upon the pristine landscape, the cowboy legends remain fresh
and vivid.</P>
<P>     In 1994 Disney cast some big stars and a top flight crew,
including director Jeremiah S. Chechik (BENNY & JOON), to make the
highly imaginative, live action film TALL TALE.  Why it did poorly at
the box office isn't clear because it is an excellent film.  Most other
movies for kids are ready to accept mediocrity.  There are so few kids'
movies produced, perhaps the studios figure that spending too much
money and effort on them is a waste.  With such a paucity of product,
the young consumers will flock to see them regardless of the quality.</P>
<P>     After the evil J.P. Stiles (Scott Glenn) tries to gain control of
his father's farm, Daniel gets the faith and embarks on his own tall
tale of an adventure.  In it he hooks up with Pecos Bill (Patrick
Swayze), John Henry (Roger Aaron Brown), and Paul Bunyan (Oliver
Platt).  Even Calamity Jane (Catherine O'Hara) has a cameo role in his
adventure.  I will not give Daniel's story away.  Better to have him
tell it.</P>
<P>     Early on in the picture, nature's grandeur engulfs the screen.
The cinematography by Academy Award winning cinematographer Janusz
Kaminski (SCHINDLER'S LIST) creates so many images of tremendous
natural beauty that they almost take your breath away.</P>
<P>     When Daniel awakes in a field of "wildflowers," the butterflies
rise up and obliterate everything in a dazzling swirl of orange and
gold.  ("Kind of all makes it worthwhile, don't you think?" is how his
friend Pecos Bill puts it when the butterflies take flight.)  Towards
night Kaminski captures the royal blue of twilight in the most mystical
way imaginable.  And, the rust colored canyons of the West have never
been shown more majestically.</P>
<P>     The beautiful sets are by Academy Award winner Eugenio Zanetti
(RESTORATION).  The sweeping musical score is by Randy Edelman, who did
one of my all-time favorite movie scores, the one for GETTYSBURG.</P>
<P>     The script by Steven Bloom (JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH) and Robert
Rodat (FLY AWAY HOME) is a lot of fun.  A beautiful mixture of the
mythical story of a tall tale laced with broad humor.  (As the
protagonists are crossing a scorching desert, Pecos Bill assures them
that it could be worse.  "Not as hot as the summer of '88 when the
chickens laid fried eggs and the babies cried sawdust," he tells the
others.  Eventually Paul Bunyan has had enough of Pecos's ramblings and
shuts him up with the retort, "Does this story have a point or does it
go on and on and on?")</P>
<P>     The script has just enough pathos to counterbalance the lighter
parts.  ("As far as Pa is concerned, I never do nothing right," laments
Daniel to John Henry.  John Henry proceeds to tell him how his father
was "sold down river," so he never saw him again.  This makes Daniel
realize how lucky he is to even have a father.)</P>
<P>     The story teaches, not preaches, good values.  Patrick Swayze, who
does the best of several good pieces of acting in the show, looks like
he is developing an ulcer when Daniel seems ready to give in to the
evil Stiles.  Looking Daniel straight in the eye, he pleads with him,
"Don't lose the dream!"</P>
<P>     In order to make the show palatable to the younger crowd, the
violence is limited in a surprising way.  Pecos shoots off the trigger
fingers of the villains, sometimes from a dozen of them at a time.
This incapacitates them without killing them.  Still it does make
tracking Pecos easier.  When Stiles finds a trigger finger lying in the
desert sand, he knows that Pecos must have passed this way.</P>
<P>     TALL TALE is a child's story told with imagination and good
acting.  A well developed story that enchants its viewers, young and
old.</P>
<P>     TALL TALE runs 1:38.  It is rated PG for mild and cartoonish
violence.  The only two potentially scary parts are when Daniel appears
about to be crushed or cut in two.  For that reason, kids under 5 might
be frightened.  My son Jeffrey, age 8, likes the picture "a whole lot."
His absolute favorite character was Pecos Bill, but he was disappointed
that they did not cast a larger actor for the Paul Bunyan role, which
is a good point.  I recommend the movie to you and your family and give
it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
