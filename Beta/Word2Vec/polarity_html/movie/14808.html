CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Steven Spielberg is now considered as one of the Hollywood
deities, because of the rare capability to deliver both huge
commercial hits, like JURASSIC PARK, and "Oscar"-awarded
critical triumphs like SCHINDLER'S LIST. However, in the
1970s Spielberg built his reputation by creating works of
art that could slip in both categories. One of them is CLOSE
ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, extremely popular and
influential science-fiction spectacle. Unfortunately, it had
a bad luck to be released in the same year as STAR WARS.
Although both films have a lot in common (ground-breaking
special effects, brilliant score by John Williams) their
future was different; one became an unstoppable cult
phenomenon, and another almost forgotten and stuck forever
in its shadow.</P>
<P>When Spielberg began work on that project, he was already
established as a bright new Hollywood star due to his
previous commercial hit, JAWS. Together with other young
directors of his "New Hollywood" generation, like Kauffman,
Carpenter, Hill and Millius, he exploited the great creative
freedom of 1970s, when even the mainstream producers dared
to experiment. Ironically, it was Spielberg himself whose
later commercial success would established new unwritten
rules of "blockubuster" philosophy. But in the mid 1970s,
many things were different; Spielberg was young and eager to
use Hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic
movie.</P>
<P>Although very personal, Spielberg's screenplay was partly
based on the book "UFO Experience" by Dr. J. Allen Hynek and
in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of
extraterrestrial visitors to Earth that began to grow in the
world after WW2. Spielberg was not only inspired by the
mythology, but his movie also gave the mythology itself a
huge boost, unmatched until the contemporary era of X-FILES
and the Roswell anniversary. That was partly because he made
the movie very realistic using the authentic UFO-related
incidents as the element of the plot. The story begins with
one of such incidents - team of international scientists
come to the Sonorra Desert in Mexico to find the U.S. Navy
planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous
Flight 19. Such events coincide with the UFO incident
witnessed by Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), power company
worker from Muncie, Indiana, who later becomes obsessed with
his experience. Because of his obsession he loses his job,
family and sanity, but his loss is nothing compared to the
experience of Jillian Guiler (Melinda Dillon), single mother
whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction. In the
meantime, the scientists decipher the strange signals from
outer space and U.S. government, in co-operation with the
French, led by Lacombe (Francois Truffaut) begin with the
preparation for ultra-secret project. When the news of the
poison gas leak in the middle of Wyoming reach Neary, he
finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the
perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area. There
he is joined by Jillian who shared the similar visions. Two
of them must break through military pickets and reach their
destination to find whatever is there.</P>
<P>Spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same
techniques of JAWS to make completely different effects. The
slow, gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic
incidents - "close encounters" - is set in order to bring
the viewer to the great revelation in the finale. But,
instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the
JAWS, we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder.
Throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big,
magnificent and wonderful is about to happen, and great
magician Spielberg delivers his promise in the end. The last
sequence, with its, even in this age, impressive special
effects by the great virtuoso Douglas Trumbull, would leave
many mouths open.</P>
<P>One of the great virtues of this film is its optimism.
Aliens, who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in
science-fiction cinema, are here benevolent and harmless
creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is
a beginning of something wonderful. It is very ironic, when
we consider that the two classic SF movies that visually
inspired Spielberg actually told quite different story -
Howard Hawks' THING and Byron Haskin's WAR OF THE WORLDS
presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind.
Spielberg's humane approach and faith in the future also
lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era;
the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-Watergate
portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the
public. But, even such government is much more harmless
compared to the murderous and chain-smoking Men in Black
that became the stereotype thanks to X-FILES and its more
cynical and disturbing visions.</P>
<P>There lies the main, and probably the only flaw of this
great picture - lack of conflict, and consequently, lack of
drama. The movie has few excitements or even action scenes
(especially the last that may be an interesting homage to
Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST) but generally, almost
everyone - Neary, Jillian, government, aliens - are the good
guys. Despite such shortcomings, the actors were good and
manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles.
Richard Dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary, yet nice
guy, who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a
grand finale. Melinda Dillon was, on the other hand,
nominated for "Oscar" as a struggling mother, yet she was
overshadowed by Teri Garr as Neary's long-suffering wife
Ronnie. Apart from visual wonders of this film, Spielberg's
semi-official composer John Williams again excels by his
beautiful music, this time using the simple melody both as
the element of a plot, and as the basis for his score.</P>
<P>The aliens, who are the main subject of this film, were
visually very convincing. Too convincing, one of my
acquaintances in the UFO-researching circles said. According
to him, the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned
little people with big eyes was so accurate, that it managed
to freak out powerful government figures interested in
suppressing the truth about UFOs. So, they later approached
Spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien,
this time designed to be anything but the real life. The
result was E.T., for many years the biggest commercial hit
of all times, yet less inspirational for UFO enthusiasts.</P>
<P>Anyway, whether the viewer believes in existence of
extraterrestrials or UFOs, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD
KIND remains the great movie, and one of the rare uplifting
experiences in modern cinema.</P>
