<P>     Many people dislike French films for their lack of closure.  While
possibly shallow, I've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany, or
at least a resolution, in the films which I view.  There is no
revelation in UN COEUR EN HIVER in the traditional; however, the film
is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a
passion-denying protagonist, Stephane (Daniel Auteuil).</P>
<P>     Stephane (Daniel Auteuil) is a master violin maker.  He is
passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the
music which his craft is responsible for producing.  Even the
relationship between he and his boss, Maxime (Andre Dussollier) is a
controlled, and almost manipulated association, highlighted by the fact
that Stephane permits Maxime to win close squash matches.  In the
beginning of the movie, Stephane is a closed, solitary individual and
the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion
behind this enigmatic man.</P>
<P>     Camille Kessler (Emmanuelle Beart) is a master violinist and the
new love of Maximes.  Maxime is so much in love with Camille that he
plans to and does leave his wife.  Like Stephane, Camille is outwardly
very controlled and reserved, sacrificing all thought and emotion to
her violin and the music which emerges.</P>
<P>     When Stephane and Camille meet, there is a recognition of a
bonding by both individuals.  However, whereas Camille submits to the
wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for Stephane, Stephane
only admits that Camille is attracted to him.  Stephane ignores his
feelings for Camille, which the audience cannot help but to see is
present.</P>
<P>     As the movie progresses, the two characters become more and more
polarized in their views and emotions for one another.  These two
people, with very similar approaches to life initially, react to their
new circumstance very differently.  Stephane becomes even more rational
and controlled, while Camille becomes more tempestuous, until she
almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to
consummate their relationship.</P>
<P>     However, their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising
considering their vocation.  The audience is led to believe that
Stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well, due to his
relationship with a master violin teacher.  However, apparently, he
could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his
playing.  Consequently, Stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the
instrument and no longer plays.  In contrast, Camille had almost given
the violin, years earlier.  However, with the aid of her manager, she
has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest, successfully
submerging herself to her playing.</P>
<P>     During the course of the movie, we see both characters evolve as
they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions.  Stephane
attempts to remain unchanged.  However, we do see subtle hints of his
transformation.  One of the most obvious is when he defeats Maxime in
squash.</P>
<P>     The development of all of the characters, many of which is not
included in this synopsis, is incredible.  American movies, with rare
exceptions, have not and I would daresay cannot approach foreign films
in character development.  In its essence, this movie is about the
development and growth of the characters, Camille and Stephane.  The
portrayal of all the other characters in the movie, including a death,
is to further the development of Camille's and Stepahne's characters.</P>
<P>     I am not sure why Berardinelli says, "At times it becomes
difficult to determine whether Stephane should be pitied or vilified,
and it is to Auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this
uncertainty."  This movie is not about judging Stephane's actions as
being right or wrong, but about viewing their growth and accepting the
characters as who they are.</P>
<P>     I find the ending appropriate; unfortunately, I found the last ten
minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling.  This
portion of the film is where the "sense of closure" could have been
successfully accomplished.  Unfortunately, there is a hurried and
almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters.</P>
<P>     While Ravel may not be quite as accomplished as Schubert or
Mozart, Ravel has his day in this film.  The synergism of the tension
of Ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best I have ever
seen.</P>
<P>     The directing in this movie is wonderful.  The actors and
actresses are excellent, each playing their part with great sincerity
and warmth.  Emmanuelle Beart's personality is beautiful.  And needless
to say, I must say that Emmanuelle Beart, herself, is beautiful.
Besides the near ending, the only other criticism of the movie which I
have is that the movie is almost too cerebral.  I almost left with the
sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the
movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities
or the situations which they end as part of.  The one question which I
am left with is while they have accepted their lot, has their attitude
towards love changed?  I have several possibilities which I believe the
movie hints at, but I am unsure of which the director is espousing.</P>
<P>     In summary, this movie is solely about the character growth of two
characters who almost develop a relationship.  In the process, we see
their attitude towards life and other people.  In itself, I do not
believe Un Coeur is a complicated movie.  Where it does become
complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the
greater walk of life where we, as Americans, have preconceived American
notions of relationship, love, and people.</P>
<P>     I do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native
French culture.  However, I, bringing my American preconceptions,
enjoyed the film.  I would welcome any comments about this movie from
any who have seen it.</P>
