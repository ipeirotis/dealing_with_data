<P>     It's great fun, but certainly not great art.  FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, 
a special effects blood-and-gore extravaganza from director Robert 
Rodriguez, follows in the footsteps of such cult classics as Sam Raimi's 
EVIL DEAD series, thumbing its nose at conventional film expectations 
and gleefully embracing the campiness of the B-movie genre.  With its 
palette of hideous monstrosities, decapitations, dismemberments, 
eviscerations, topless dancers, profane dialogue, and bare foot licking, 
this motion picture pushes the R-rating to the edge.  </P>
<P>     Yet the reason FROM DUSK TILL DAWN entertains is because it never 
takes itself seriously.  The film is steeped in wit, parody, and offbeat 
humor.  There aren't any characters here -- only caricatures.  The movie 
has been designed as a burst of high energy, and that's exactly what it 
turns out to be.  FROM DUSK TILL DAWN will appeal to only a small 
portion of the cinema-visiting population, but for those who enjoy this 
kind of tongue-and-cheek horror story, the film has a lot to offer.</P>
<P>     FROM DUSK TILL DAWN marks the most recent phase in the creative 
collaboration between Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.  (Tarantino 
appeared in Rodriguez's DESPERADO and the two were both involved in FOUR 
ROOMS.)  For this film, not only is Tarantino credited with the 
screenplay, but he has a significant on-screen role.  Although a 
terrible performer, he doesn't actually damage the movie, however, 
because acting ability has little merit here.  </P>
<P>     In FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, the setup is as long as the main story.  
The film opens by introducing us to two bank robbers on the run -- Seth 
Gecko (George Clooney) and his nutcase brother Richie (Tarantino).  
They're on their way to Mexico, but they need a cover to get across the 
border.  So, to that end, they hijack the mobile home of ex-preacher 
Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and Ernest 
Lieu), and force them, at gunpoint, to help.  Once in Mexico, the five 
stop at an all-night bar for a little R&R.  Only one problem:  the place 
is run by vampires, and, after a little topless dancing, it's feeding 
time.</P>
<P>     For the most part, Tarantino's dialogue here pales in comparison to 
what he wrote for RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION.  That said, however, 
there's still a snappy rhythm to the way the men, women, and undead of 
FROM DUSK TILL DAWN speak.  The script is peppered with deadpan humor, 
from allusions to Peter Cushing's Hammer Horror battles against Dracula 
to Harvey Keitel's Bible quotations as he sets about taking out his 
demonic opponents.  There are also numerous references, visual and 
otherwise, to previous work by Tarantino and Rodriguez.  Depending on 
your opinion of the two men, this can be seen as either clever or self-
indulgent.</P>
<P>     The only one who really attempts any sort of real acting is Keitel.  
Everyone else is just out there kicking butt, taking their lumps, and 
occasionally getting bitten in the neck.  TV veteran George Clooney, 
making his feature debut, generates a palpable screen presence.  His 
deadpan delivery of lines like "psychos do not explode when sunlight 
hits them" is priceless.</P>
<P>     At present, there is a Tarantino backlash in progress, but it's 
unlikely that the growing public dislike of "Mr. Overexposure" is going 
to damage FROM DUSK TILL DAWN's box-office prospects, since the target 
audience won't care about the prevailing opinion of the screenwriter/co-
star.  What they want, this film offers:  a stylish, ultra-hip twist to 
one of humanity's oldest, darkest legends.  Vampires will never live 
this one down.  </P>
