GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1999</PRE>
<P>Whenever U.S. government starts meddling into other
countries' affairs, under the pretext of supporting human
rights or preventing political, religious or ethnic
persecution, the other side is ready to use mantra that says
"Look who's talking! What have you done to the Indians?"
However, even the Americans themselves are ready to use that
dark chapter of their own national history when it suits
their purposes. Hollywood is just another example, with its
revisionist westerns, made in early 1990s. Those movies
tried to exploit the emerging wave of Political Correctness,
coinciding with the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery
of America. One of such examples is GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN
LEGEND, 1993 western directed by Walter Hill, film that
deals with one of the last conflicts between American
natives and white settlers.</P>
<P>The hero of the film is Geronimo (played by Wes Studi),
leader of Apaches, fierce warrior tribe that used to give
hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th
century. When the movie begins, in 1885, Geronimo and his
Apaches made peace with U.S. government and try to live
peacefully in Arizona reservation. However, broken promises,
injustice and violence against his people would make
Geronimo restless. With not more 30 or so of his followers,
he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign. General
Crook (Gene Hackman), commander of U.S. Army forces,
respects Geronimo and knows that even his 5,000 force isn't
enough to catch Geronimo in the great spaces of the American
Southwest. Instead, he turns to people who are more
experienced with Apaches - Lt. Charles Gatewood (Jason
Patric) and Indian hunter Al Sieber (Robert Duvall).
Together with young Lt. Britton Davis (Matt Damon) they
would begin mission aimed at capturing Geronimo.</P>
<P>GERONIMO: AN AMERICAN LEGEND, like many movies made under
the shadow of Political Correctness, try to tell the tale
about oppressed minorities, but instead the real subject is
the bad conscience of the oppressors. So, the story about
Geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies. Almost
all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every
opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to
fight him and his people. Although such elements of John
Millius' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history,
they harm the story of Geronimo. To be honest, Walter Hill
does try to make Geronimo the real hero of the film, but the
movie segments that deal with the plight of Apaches and the
uprising are given too little time. Instead, they turn out
to be nothing more than the back story for rather
uninteresting adventure story of Gatewood and his band. To
make even worse, Hill has some real problems with pacing and
style, and in the end we have impression that we are
watching two films badly edited into one - story about
Geronimo and story about his pursuers. The movie should have
been better if it turned to Geronimo's life before and after
his last uprising, in many ways more interesting than the
story about Gatewood.</P>
<P>The difference between those segments could be observed
through the different quality of acting. Wes Studi, Cherokee
actor who was so impressive as Magua in THE LAST OF THE
MOHICANS, was perfect choice for Geronimo, not only because
he resembles Geronimo, but because he induces a lot of
passion in his role. Contrary to him, we have disinterested
actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies.
While this could be expected from someone like Jason Patric,
it is shame when we have veterans like Gene Hackman or
Robert Duvall. Even Hill's directing is bellow expectations
- battle scenes are too short and, like in many of his late
films, force viewers to ask what had happened to the great
action director of 1970s. Even his old associate, music
composer Ry Cooder, disappoints, with the score that shifts
between Indian motives and classic. On the other hand,
photography by Lloyd Ahern II, with the use of red lenses,
gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere, ideal for this movie that
was supposed to be melancholic epic. All in all, compared
with some of the Hollywood's examples of Political
Correctness, this film isn't so bad, but we are left with
the unpleasant impression that it could have been better.</P>
