<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It is chilling to look back at this 1971 pseudo-documentary and see how
divisive things looked at a time when emotions were running high in
America between the older and younger generations. The Britisher, noted
for making pseudo-documentaries, Peter Watkins (Culloden/The War Game),
made this political film at a time of the Vietnam war protests and deep
civil unrest in the country, and in the aftermath of the debacle with
the 1968 Democratic Convention and of the Kent State murders by the
National Guard. It stridently shows in its futuristic prediction what
the United States might become like if the reactionary right-wing had
their way. It is a polemic exercise between the Left and the Right, with
no room for the middle point of view.</P>
<P>The film opens on the note that an Insurrection Act was passed in 1950,
which gives the government the right to suspend certain rights in an
emergency such as, eliminating the Fifth Amendment, holding suspects
without charges indefinetly, revoking bail, having detention camps, and
a tribunal. The reason for these laws being enforced now, are that
things are getting chaotic because of all the civil unrest. There is a
call for "law and order" to take back the streets from the protesters.</P>
<P>War protesters and the civil rights activists are placed on trial and
charged with conspiring to overthrow the government. They face long
Federal prison terms if convicted, some for life and the short sentences
being for seven years, or they can choose to undergo a three-day ordeal
in the 100 degree Southern California desert, where they must reach a
designated destination marked by the American flag, if they are to go
free. The catch is, that they have no chance of reaching that
destination since they are permitted to only go in a certain restricted
route and they have no food or water, and there are National Guardsman
and local police there ready to fire on them at will. The place is
appropriately called Punishment Park, as it seems to be devised as a
means of killing off the protesters quickly, much like Hitler's gas
chambers.</P>
<P>The film intercuts between the ongoing trial of a number of radicals
with those in Punishment Park trying to win their freedom. Though the
director tries to present some of the establishments' arguments against
these young dissenters to show that he is impartial, the weight of what
is going down is so heavy, that even when the tribunal members make a
plausible response, it still sounds vacuous given the current situation.
They mostly say things like the protesters don't care about this
country, that the Vietnam war is a "just" war because it is aimed to
stop the spread of communism, and that the protesters are trying to make
a mockery of the American way of life. While the protesters under arrest
are broken down into basically two camps- the pacifists and those
willing to use arms against the government. A Black Panther member says,
this is a violent and racist country, and it does not deserve the
support of the people. That the politician is nothing but a debater.
While the pacifists' say that war is only just when it is entered into
without any hatred in one's heart. The honorable thing to do at a crisis
time like this, is be a criminal -- that at another time it might be to
become a politician.</P>
<P>The film had a gritty look to it and should bring back some of the worst
confrontational memories of a time the country was divided in a very
hostile way. What was missing from the film, was a sense that it could
accomplish anything. But, maybe, that wasn't possible, especially
looking at this film some thirty years later and realizing how there was
no way to justify the war and the racism at the time. To add to that the
fictional suspension of individual rights and a horror chamber like
Punishment Park, makes this film seem like a futile diatribe that lost
its prospective of what its aim was. Yet, if the film's polemics
disturbs, but fails to entertain as a film, it still had some bite in
it, and its non-professional cast made this an unusual film, one worth
watching for all the intensity it displayed despite its inability to
alter any one's mind from their current views. It is, simply, preaching
to the choir.</P>
