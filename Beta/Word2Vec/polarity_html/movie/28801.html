<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A brilliantly stylized period piece set in Kyoto in 1865, during the final days
of the samurais. It's written and directed by the great Japanese filmmaker,
Nagisa Oshima (In the Realm of the Senses/Empire of Passion/Merry Christmas, Mr.
Lawrence). This is the 69-year-old filmmaker's first feature in 14 years and the
first since the 1995 minor stroke which left him part-paralysed on his right
side. He directed this powerful film, which explores homosexuality in the ranks
of the military, from a wheelchair. It also relates to the affects of
uncontrollable passion with death, as it explores how jealousy among men lovers
can be deadly. </P>
<P>Taboo has a dreamlike quality to it that is spellbinding as it creates an eerie
blue mood and makes the characters glow with a haunting feeling that this tale
is taking place in the afterworld. Its tale is focused on a new recruit to the
Shinsen militia, who seeks to become a samurai warrior. He's an effeminate and
beautiful 18-year-old, a rich merchant's son named Sozaburo Kano (Ryuhei
Matsuda). The militia he joins puts down insurrections, maintains order among
the clans, and protects the shogun. At the same time he joins, another recruit
-- Hyozo Tashiro (Tadanobu Asano), a commoner, also becomes a samurai. They are
selected by Commander Isami Kondo (Yoichi Sai) and his Lieutenant Commander,
Captain Toshizo Hijikata (Takeshi Kitano). Kano is very appealing because of his
boyish locks of hair and sensual and regal mannerisms, and his great ability as
a warrior; his stunning looks attracts everyone's attention. In history, the
Shinsen militia was renown for its ruthless code of conduct, its violent use of
force, and its open homosexuality. </P>
<P>The plot revolves around the lust among the men for him, as he joins them in the
barracks. The first to have a whack at him is Tashiro, who cuddles up to him in
their sleeping quarters and gets him from behind as Kano passively says nothing
but appears to not be stimulated by the rape. But he rebuffs his advances to be
lovers, even as he says that he never has known a woman's caresses. His
superiors, Kondo and Hijikata, take an obsessive interest in him and act
concerned that there is a jealousy among the men over him, thinking this will
spoil the militia's unity (the U.S. Army might have the same homosexual dilemma
in mind when they initiated their policy of: don't ask, don't tell). </P>
<P>To test his courage, the new recruit is ordered to carry out a beheading of a
fellow sumarai who broke the strict rules of conduct. Kano executes him without
any hesitation and with an efficiency that greatly pleases his superiors. Later,
he is ordered to kill Tashiro, whom his superiors suspect of being his lover and
of being overly jealous that Kano is seeing other men. He does that assignment
without one peep of protest. The superiors further connive to find ways to deal
with this situation, as Hijikata orders a sergeant to get him a geisha girl. But
Kano refuses to sleep with her, saying he prefers the sergeant. The commanders
discuss between them all the rumors surrounding Kano and his lovers, as the film
concocts a bitter story about a possessed young man who joined the militia so he
can kill freely. He's an individual who is now faced with resolving what he
narcissistically has attracted. </P>
<P>The film is an ambiguous one. Its look at homosexuality is also a look at how
others look at it, and what we know about that is seen in the expressions made.
It examines the violence that goes with a sex that is against the law. The most
mysterious scene comes at the end, when we look into Takeshi Kitano's face (his
is the most expressive one and perhaps, even though he's a heterosexual, the one
who is most jealous of Kano) -- and follow his emotional thrusts as he cuts down
a cherry tree in bloom with his sword at his anger over what he believes he sees
in Kano and in himself. The film ends without a clarity to what Kano or the
commanders were going through internally. It works best as poetry, as it seems
to connect the beauty of Kano with an inherent evil he possesses to draw those
to him who are willing to die for their desires. It's the closest we might come
to decifering what all the ambiguity meant, as each one's perception might
differ as to what beauty is and what price they are willing to pay for it. A
thoroughly maddening work from arguably Japan's best living director. </P>
