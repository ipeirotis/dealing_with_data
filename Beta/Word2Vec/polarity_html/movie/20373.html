LAMERICA (director/writer: Gianni Amelio; screenwriters: Alessandro
Sermoneta/Andrea Porporati; cinematographer: Luca Bigazzi; cast: Enrico
Lo Verso (Gino), Carmelo Di Mazzarelli (Michele, "chairman"), Michele
Placido (Fiore), 1994-It)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"I'm Italian, don't you understand?" So go the utterings to deaf
Albanian police ears, of Gino (Enrico), a brash, young con man from
Italy, who came to Albania to be an assistant to another con man, the
more experienced, Fiore (Placido), and has now gotten himself mired in
the hopelessness of this country, clinging to his superior Italian
birthright in the face of failing to pull off his scam, and is left
abandoned in Albania. They came to this impoverished country to run a
scam shoe company, to make someone who is inept and has no relatives be
the dummy "chairman" (Carmelo) of their bogus company, with their hope
to get the Italian government to give them a grant, which they almost
always do for those who fought the Communist regime. The con men would
then take the grant money and skip town, never even making one pair of
shoes.</P>
<P>Amelio's film is a political one, with a black comedic edge to it, as it
traces the tragic recent history of Albania, studying the dehumanizing
effect bad governments have on its people. In its opening credits, it
uses actual newsreel footage of Il Duce's arrival in 1939, Albania, as
it shows his conquest of the country. When WW11 ended, the Soviet
Communist regime supported the local dictatorship and the country
remained isolated, with its vast problems of poverty unknown to most of
the world; that is, until 1991, when a supposedly "new" democratic
regime took over and opened up the country for the world to see. Italy
was flooded with a wave of Albanian immigrants, looking to that country
to fulfill its utopian dreams because of its material and cultural
strength, but Italy could not handle the onslaught of so many people,
and would not let anymore immigrants in. What remains for these people
is a pipe dream of escaping to Italy, as they are stuck where they are.
The new regime is just as bad as all the other regimes; it is actually
made up of most of the leaders from the past, who only change the name
of their ruling party.</P>
<P>This is a rather slow-moving film, that is chocked full of themes and
universal messages the director feels impelled to get across. Whether it
is worthwhile or not to have a film be so politically motivated that it
fails to be entertaining, is up to you to decide. The political aims
seem necessary to see and understand for the viewer, the reward comes in
images that stick with you long after viewing the film. Therefore, this
becomes a special film, not necessarily a better film, but one that is
made beneficial for those who are interested enough to stick with this
film's slow pace and all the political explorations that are needed to
show how corrupt and decaying Albania really is and how cherished the
human spirit is, sometimes able to survive on the barest evidence of
hope.</P>
<P>Amelio (Open Doors, Stolen Children) has so much political ground to
cover that the film becomes overwhelmed with the misery of its
exploration and suffers because of it. Problems such as immigration,
poverty, corruption, cultural decadence, ignorance, hate, greed, and a
generation influenced by Italian television are just too complicated and
heavy to handle without sacrificing something in the process. What is
sacrificed, is that, though I liked what I saw, I did not feel
passionately about it. It was a cold but intellectually sound effort.</P>
<P>The character of Gino is examined most closely and he becomes the
messenger for the director's viewpoint, as he is trapped in the bleak
Albanian countryside trying to make his scam work. His car tires are
stolen, along with his passport (identity), clothes (appearance) and the
arrogance he had when he first came. His handpicked "chairman" turns out
to be an Italian army deserter from 1939 and not an Albanian
anti-Communist. The "chairman" has tried to stop time, thinking he is
still 20-years-old, living as if nothing took place the last 50-years
since he has been in prison. He forms a very strange relationship with
the Italian, both skeptical of him and later on thinking of him as a
fellow traveler, who is abused by the world situation. The heart of the
film lies in the change that overcomes Gino. This nightmarish episode in
his life is certainly profound and deadly. He can never be the same
again. By the final scene, he is stripped of his worldly possessions,
ragged and tired looking, looking somewhat like an Albanian refuge. And
that is the success of this film. We are forced into seeing the poverty
that exists there, and even if we don't like to be put in that position,
there is nothing that we can do about it. There are just no answers, and
the film is left without a happy ending, only a few images of hope. This
is seen, when a little girl in a remote Albanian village, freely dances
and dreams of a better life somewhere else than in the barren land she
was born in.</P>
