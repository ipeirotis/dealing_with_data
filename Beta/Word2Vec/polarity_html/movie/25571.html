<P>     Yes, it's another independent film about hyperarticulate-yet-
underemployed guys in need of a lot of growing up. It's also a fairly 
funny one, following the adventures of a philosophically inclined slacker
named Dex (Donal Logue). Though he was a brilliant student in college, ten
years later Dex is overweight, often stoned, a part-time worker at a day
care center and still living in a communal house with his male pals. That
doesn't prevent him from having plenty of success at sexual conquest, a
phenomenon he attributes to his adherence to "The Tao of Steve," based on
archetypal male behavior with the opposite sex. But his philosophy is
challenged by the reappearance of an old college acquaintance named Syd
(Greer Goodman), who throws a wrench into Dex's usually simple approach to
life.</P>
<P>     Co-writer/director Jenniphr Goodman (sister of co-star/co-writer
Greer) does exactly what one has to do to keep the "overgrown adolescent
finds love" story fresh. First, she gets good performances out of her
actors, particularly Logue, who imbues Dex with a strange shambling
charisma. Second, she creates sparks between her two romantic leads with
appealing situations like the hike and camping trip that shows Dex to be
truly at two with nature. Finally, she crafts sharp dialogue to wrap
around the provocative central philosophy devised by co-writer Duncan
North. It's the sort of thing that could be as talked about as WHEN HARRY
MET SALLY's infamous "men and women can't be friends" notion, positing
that the surest way to a woman's heart is to treat her with indifference. 
First dates beware: This may get you into deeper discussion than you'd
like.</P>
<P>     The result is a love story that's as smart and entertaining as it
is utterly predictable and instantly forgettable. It's fun watching
Logue's Dex play mentor to a romantically inept young acquaintance (Kimo
Wills), but it's clear virtually from the outset that the entire purpose
of the narrative is to humble Dex. That humbling occurs during a climax
that takes contrived to a new level, a genuinely clumsly conclusion to an
otherwise generally satisfying story. It's testimony to the effectiveness
of THE TAO OF STEVE's punch lines -- instantly quote-worthy though they're
not -- that the film  overcomes its erratic pacing and limp climax. And it
probably helps to be an alum of the School of Hyperarticulate-Yet-
Underemployed Guys to appreciate the minor charms of a film that's equally
comfortable tossing off references to Kierkegaard and "The Bugaloos."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Tao above-averages:  6.</PRE>
