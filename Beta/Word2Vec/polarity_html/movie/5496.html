<P>     ERASER is a strange case this summer.  Here is an Arnold
Schwarzenegger action film, carrying an estimated $80 million price tag,
recently in entertainment headlines for last-minute digital work required
to change the name of the company in the film due to a legal
challenge...and hardly anyone seems to be talking about it.  In a movie
season where marketing has attempted to turn every subsequent blockbuster
into a pop culture happening, ERASER seems to be just another supporting
player; it is even sharing its release date with Disney's latest animated
fiscal printing press THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME.  Arnold seems to have
managed the heretofore unthinkable feat of becoming unobtrusive.  The
result might be an absence of overly high expectations, which can only
work in ERASER's favor.  It's generic Schwarzeneggerian action fare which
almost manages to seem quaint in its cartoonish basic-ness.</P>
<P>     Schwarzenegger plays John Kruger, a U. S. Marshal working for the
Federal Witness Protection Program whose specialty is staging the deaths
of his charges to keep them safe -- hence his code name "Eraser."  His
latest case is Lee Cullen (Vanessa Williams), an employee at defense
contractor Cyrez who has agreed to obtain proof that the company is
involved in the sale of experimental weaponry on the black market.  What
Kruger is soon to realize is that even government officials are involved
in the operation, perhaps including his own mentor Robert Deguerin (James
Caan).  But it is Kruger himself who is set up as a traitor, and forced to
keep both himself and Lee alive.  With no one he can trust except his
other re-located witnesses, including mob stool pigeon Johnny Casteleone
(Robert Pastorelli), Kruger must find proof of his own innocence as he
tries to stop the gun-runners.</P>
<P>     ERASER is pretty much everything you've come to expect from a
Schwarzenegger action vehicle:  impossible odds, explosions, predictable
and groan-inducing one-liners (if you can't tell me what precedes the line
"They had to catch a train," please sign up for Remedial Arnie-isms), big
cool guns, and big cool Arnie firing them with abandon.  Director Charles
Russell (THE MASK) leaps right into the action with scarcely a breath, and
for the next 100 minutes seems blissfully concerned with little else.  It
is as though he were saying to the audience, "I've given you a good guy
and some bad guys -- you know how it's going to end, now enjoy the ride."</P>
<P>     And in spurts, it's actually possible to do so.  During one
marvelously sill twenty minute stretch, Schwarzenegger leaps from a plane
to catch up with a parachute he has already thrown out of it, faces down
the same plane while still floating through the air, crash lands in a
junkyard, appropriates a truck, races to a zoo and ends up battling with
villainous Feds _and_ digitally-created alligators.  In those scenes,
ERASER is pure mindless fun in the best sense of the term, but those
scenes are also somewhat isolated.  There is a surprising grimness to much
of ERASER, including two separate incidents where Kruger takes an
excruciatingly long time to remove a piece of shrapnel from his flesh, and
Schwarzenegger himself is overly somber in much of his performance,
brooding over a Dark Past to which we are not made privy.  These token
attempts by Russell and his screenplay-by-committee team to make
Schwarzenegger more vulnerable and human demonstrate a real
misunderstanding of his appeal.  Audiences come to see Schwarzenegger the
super-hero, and to laugh along with his awareness of the absurd situations
in his action films; he is the master of the catch phrase because they are
winking distillations of those absurdities.  There are far too few
opportunities to laugh in ERASER, except those provided by Robert
Pastorelli as the motor-mouthed wiseguy who becomes Kruger's assistant.</P>
<P>     The irony of ERASER is that it turns its greatest asset into a
weakness.  In a season filled with films which seem to be playing hyped-up
games of "Can You Top This?" with their visual effects and decibel levels,
ERASER provides an odd familiarity -- it's just li'l ol' Arnie, playing
hero and making the world safe for democracy.  Unfortunately, ERASER just
rests on its familiarity, providing a bland villain (Caan playing Sonny
Corleone as a turn-coat G-Man), a bland heroine (Vanessa Williams running
and serving up the occasional "I-am-woman-watch-me-kick-a-little-ass" bit
of crowd-pleasing) and a finale which is truly anti-climactic.  ERASER
manages a few solidly entertaining moments, and serves up the kind of
meat-and-potatoes action Schwarzenegger's fans have come to expect.  It
also is a film which spends a lot of time shuffling its feet, and it will
be interesting to see how audiences respond to a blockbuster which seems
to be saying, "Don't mind me."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 ERASER's edges:  5.</PRE>
