<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Now this is an indie cult film, if ever there was one. Its stars are
five overweight guys who in real life four of them are salesmen (I'm not
sure if the fifth one is also salesman), but in the film they play
fictional bible and gun salesmen from Anaheim, California, working for
" The American Bible and Gun Club." They go door-to-door pursuing the
American dream. They all have personal problems, are corrupted and
compromised by their work, and are disillusioned with life to the point
that they flip out. They sell both bibles and guns, two contrasting
products that fit very well into the mainstream of American society,
makes for a most interesting commentary on the American landscape, as
directed and written by the South African, Daniel J. Harris. He has
caught a slice of the American scene that is frighteningly perceptive to
watch. This B/W, gritty film, is so well-paced and flies by so quickly,
that you feel you know these men in the short time span you meet them
and you don't want the film to end before you find out just what happens
to them, as things begin to turn sour for them. This unique film, in the
style of the Maysles Brother's The Salesmen, packs a wallop and a sales
pitch that goes beyond the ordinary pseudo-documentary and
improvisational work. The director has tuned into the exploitation of
sex (porno), violence and organized religion in American society, and
takes that topic by the scruff of its neck and squeezes out every ounce
of its bloody truth that he can manage from it, as he notes that
everything in this capitalistic country is being done for a profit.</P>
<P>The men are heading for their parent company's annual  Las Vegas sales
convention, where they meet the big bosses and share info on selling
their product. They also find out that because of slow sales, their
branch is being transferred to Las Vegas permanently, and to show the
bosses that they still have what it takes, the five men make a concerted
effort to make the most of the time they are in Las Vegas by selling a
lot of guns and bibles. They are competing against all the other
franchises, especially the arrogant Texas one, that likes to rub it in
that they are number one. Their sales territory is north of the city, in
a trailer park where the poor live. But as their tough-hearted boss,
Bill (Al Schuermann), says, "They are good American people who are too
proud to admit that they're poor," as he licks his hands in anticipation
of some good sales.</P>
<P>The theme of the film is really geared for the 1960s in psychology, in
the music played and in the dress and style of the salesmen. They must
wear black suits and ties, and conform in all aspects of their
appearance to their company's strict dress code. But were're in the '90s
all right and that only adds weight to the idea that these men are
really dead already but they just don't know it.</P>
<P>Bill seems to have a special fondness for the elderly Sidney (Robert
Blumenthal), who has worked for him the last fifteen years, giving up
his position as a rabbi so he can provide his family with more money
than he was earning before, telling himself that selling bibles is not
that much different from what he was doing before. He seems to be the
perfect unflappable salesman, keeping all his doubts and feelings to
himself, especially as the token Jew in the firm, where he has to listen
to all the ignorant bias chatter about Jews without reacting in a
negative manner. Stan (Andy Kallok), is a middle-ager who is being kept
awake at night by flashbacks, where he is recalling everything about his
miserable life and is deeply concerned that the tumor he just discovered
in the back of his neck is possibly a deadly cancerous one. Phil (Don
Yanan) has just joined the firm as a weapon expert, after 20 years on
the LAPD force, where he speaks despiteously about the people of L.A.
and manifests symptoms of being mentally unbalanced and filled with
undue hatred. His philosophy of life goes something like this, "You
screw your wife in the morning, you work all day and you come home at
night to watch TV, anything else that happens to you is only icing on
the cake." Mike (Julian Ott) is the unsuccessful and lazy son-in-law of
Bill, who couldn't make it on the pro golf circuit, and is now bullied
by Bill unmercifully, as he tries to teach him the ropes of being a
salesman. He even has to teach him to lose in golf to the big boss of
the firm.</P>
<P>It is both grim and uncannily funny to watch these five men lose touch
with reality and have their dream world completely shattered, as they
get caught up in their sexual and violent perversions in Las Vegas;
their failure to succeed and the morbidity of their personal lives
becomes too much for them to handle, that when death strikes some of
their team, the others react as if it is just like another day at the
office. These very repulsive reactionary types are so-well caught on
camera, as they go from reading the script to ad libbing without missing
a beat, in fact the unrehearsed scenes have a special flair about them
that is macabre.</P>
<P>One of the really powerful scenes, is the opening one when they are
selling the Collectors' Edition Bible Set and a Defender 500 pump-action
shotgun in a trailer, it is almost unnerving that they keep a straight
face when they say to the poor whites they are selling this to, "The
American family deserves to be well-armed and well-read." The director
seems to imply, isn't that what America is about, anyway.</P>
<P>What these despairing and cynical bible salesmen are going through, can
be heard in the disconcerting conversation between Stanley and Sidney,
as Stanley realizes his world is crumbling before him, and he says,
"Tell the Lord not to send His Son, tell the Lord to come Himself.
They're gonna need Him," and all the impassioned Sidney can tell him, is
that he is retiring in a few months.</P>
<P>In real life, Andy Kallok is a magazine salesman, Don Yanan is a vacuum
cleaner salesman, Al Schuermann is an insurance salesman, and Robert
Blumenthal is a tacky furniture salesman . They sold me on this film.
These "stars" certainly bring a level of authenticity to the film that
is uniquely satifsying. This, suprisingly enough, is a not to be missed
film, if you can ever locate it on cable.</P>
