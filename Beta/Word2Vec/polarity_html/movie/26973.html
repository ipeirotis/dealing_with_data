<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A horror/crime melodrama told in flashback from when Dr. Ernest Sovac
(Karloff), in the opening scene, is going to the electric chair and
gives a friendly reporter witnessing the execution his diary of the
events leading up to the murder he committed.</P>
<P>This film was supposed to star Bela Lugosi in that part and Karloff was
to be the genial English lit college professor who is transformed into a
notorious gangster after a car accident destroys his brain and he gets a
brain transplant operation by his close doctor friend at Newcastle
University. But Lugosi couldn't pull it off being a surgeon and ends up
in a minor part as the gangster Marnay. A part he also did not
distinguish himself in. The one who steals this film is the British
actor Stanley Ridges, who will play a dual role of the small-town
university professor, George Kingsley, and one of the gangster Red
Cannon.</P>
<P>The action perks up when the popular Kingsley teaches his last class and
has mixed feelings about transferring to a larger university, already
missing the students he loves to teach. While crossing the street, he
gets caught in the middle of a gang shoot-out and gets run over. The
gangster Red Cannon sustains paralysing spinal injuries and is taken to
the same hospital as Kingsley. The prognosis for Kingsley is that he
will not recover. Sovac decides to save his friend's life by
transplanting part of Cannon's brain into Kingsley, as Cannon begs the
doctor to operate on him and correct his spinal injury. The operation
proves fatal for Red but successful for Kingsley, except for mood
changes, as the gentle professor begins having fits of surliness. In his
convalescence, there are times he is not himself. Sovac also discovers
that Cannon hid away $500,000, which he wants to get his hands on and
use that money to build a medical research facility.</P>
<P>He thereby decides to take the professor to New York, using the excuse
that this will help his recovery. But what he is really after, is to
rattle his mind so he thinks like Red and leads him to the hidden money.
Sovac hypnotizes Kingsley into taking on the character of Red Cannon,
but it turns deadly as he starts getting revenge on the gang that was
after him and he also kills a few detectives who question him.</P>
<P>Spoilers in the next three paragraphs.</P>
<P>In New York the two stay in the same hotel and the same room that Red
stayed at, and when the professor has flashes that he's Red, he changes
facial expressions and becomes mean like Red. He kills off the two gang
members Devore and Kane and meets his songbird girlfriend Sunny (Nagel)
in the night club where she works, remembering everything about her
habits and her apartment. She is freaked out by the whole thing and is
no longer attracted to him, as he thinks and acts like Red but looks
like this nerdy professor-type.</P>
<P>She makes a deal with Marnay and his other henchman Miller to let them
follow him to the park where he hid the money, but he outwits them and
strangles Miller and follows Marnay back to Sunny's apartment, where he
kills both of them.</P>
<P>During this period Kingsley's wife (Brissac) and Sovac's daughter
(Gwynee), worried about his health, come to take the professor back to
Newcastle. The film concludes as Sovac realizes that the experiment went
south, as Kingsley reverts back to being Red while in Newcastle and
attacks Sovac's daughter. Sovac then shoots him and is thusly sentenced
to death, which is the part where the film opened at.</P>
<P>"Black Friday" was fast-paced, had a good cast, and had an interesting
story but it could have probably been more interesting if the story
wasn't so convoluted. It's a thriller that could have used a few more
thrills, suffering mostly from the flat way it was directed. The results
are a mixed bag, but there's enough entertainment to be gotten from this
B-film, to make it a satisfying watch.</P>
