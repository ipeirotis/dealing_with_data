<PRE>"Return to Me" Review
by Fontaine Lien</PRE>
<P>After having heard so many critics describe "Return to Me" as an
old-fashioned Hollywood romance, I kept asking myself going into this
movie: What exactly is an old-fashioned Hollywood romance?  What made
"Return to Me" old-fashioned and old-Hollywood?  Was it the tunes from
Sinatra, etc., legendary singers the senior citizens in the film
constantly harp on?  Was it the glamorous, sophisticated feel?  The
charisma of the two leads?  Even now I can't say that I have gotten
any closer to the real answer, because I haven't see that many
old-fashioned Hollywood romances.  I don't think any of the romances
I've seen have been classified as such.  Which leaves me the option of
vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- "Return to Me" was
old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger
generation perceive venerated old Hollywood magic, the way I perceive
cinnamon spice and apple cider.  It was traditional, magical.  We knew
it couldn't be too daring, or have any surprising plot twists that
many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in.  It was a romance
told with such endearing simplicity, tenderness, and love (from
director Bonnie Hunt) that it couldn't help but sparkle with charm
despite its shortcomings.</P>
<P>The film owes a lot of what it has to Bonnie Hunt's direction.  From
the very first bird's eye view of Chicago, zooming in slowly toward
the insignificant Bob Rueland (David Duchovny), accompanied by the
"Return to Me" ballad (by whom?), we can tell we're in for something
sweet.  The scenes between the characters are endearing, truthful,
with just a hint of fantasy.  Real people don't act that way; real
people aren't that nice.  We know all this, and yet we want to believe
in these folks' existence.  The premise itself seems to have sprung
out of a fairytale, but Hunt's rooting the fairytale in common Chicago
folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday
urban life with a hint of the ethereal.  Everything is ordinary--yet
beautiful--in this film.  >From the festive little family restaurant
to Grace (Minnie Driver) and Bob's wardrobes.  From the eloquent,
not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that
Grace paints.  From the animal stars to the way all the characters
interact on screen -- the most beautiful part.  "Return to Me" has
done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who
blend in effortlessly as a family: the audience has no trouble at all
believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist.  We care
for them, laugh with them, cry with them; we're concerned that the
little boy will pick up cursing from his father. Whatever Hunt did,
she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors.</P>
<P>Disappointingly, David Alan Grier's Charlie, however much I like him,
was the most flatly-written.  Duchovny here does a laudable job of
shaking off his Fox Mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow
co-stars rarely do we see any hint of Special Agent Fox Mulder.
Instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more
delight than Fox Mulder will show over the span of an entire season of
"The X-Files." Duchovny, who is excellent at understatement and
self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent
on screen.  Minnie Driver is engaging as always as the sweet, innocent
Grace with nothing but a good heart to offer.  Though an unlikely
pair, Duchovny and Driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie
progresses.</P>
<P>While "Return to Me" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy,
a romantic scenic tour through Chicago, and a tearjerker, the story is
set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop.  The entire
climax of the film hinges on when and how Grace is going to tell Bob
that she actually was the recipient of his wife's heart.  We already
know that there's going to be a happy ending; we feel like we spend
the entire film, however enjoyably, in a straight line going towards
that point.  As a result Bob and Grace click almost too quickly--yes,
I know she's supposed to have his ex-wife's heart and everything--it
seems too effortless.  The main subject is a love story, and the
family scenes I love so much unfortunately are overused and distract
from the turmoil of the two main characters (whose story might not
have that much meat after all).  However, in the spirit of "Return to
Me," it won't do to be too picky about how "old" Hollywood tells its
stories.  I loved knowing that this was a labor of love for Bonnie
Hunt.  It shows.  The bottom line: "Return to Me" is nothing
remarkable, and yet its sweetness, sincerity, and charm might touch
your heart in ways that you hadn't imagined.</P>
