<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A hard-hitting tale about Glasgow street life in a working class
neighborhood, set in 1968. The three MacLean brothers live with their
widowed mother, Lorna (Higgins), in a small flat in the outlying area of
the city. They all miss very much their dead father, though it is the
eldest Bobby (Duffy) who misses him the most, troubled by nightmares,
lack of intelligence, and an uncontrollable anger. He belongs to the
local gang 'The Glen.' Alan (Joseph MacFadden) is the 18-year-old middle
brother who is studying at an art school, trying to avoid gang life and
is having a flirtatious relationship with an enchanting 19-year-old,
Joanne (Fraser). She is two-timing the psychopathic gang leader of the
Tongs, Malky Johnson (Kevin McKidd) by somehow going out with the
eccentric gang leader of The Glen, Charlie Sloan (Garry Sweeney). The
central figure in the story is the troubled baby-faced 13-year-old Lex
(Iain Robertson), who is caught in the middle of choosing between both
his older brother's lifestyles. He is also faced with problems in school
and uncertainty of his future, but on the positive side he has shown
some passion for playing the trombone, drawing and only getting into
childish trouble. He witnesses razor fights, beatings, and terror in the
neighborhood, as he struggles to find himself with no one to guide him
properly, in this striking coming of age film. The film is told from his
view of things.</P>
<P>The mischievous Lex, while out in the park with Alan, fires an air-gun
and accidently hits Malky between the eyes while he is playing soccer.
By this rash action, he thereby brings all the MacLean brothers into the
gang feud, and that requires protection from The Glen. Charlie Sloan is
a Mick Jagger fan and somewhat artistically inclined, who brings the
feud on with the rival gang to a new height of violence.</P>
<P>There is one telling scene of the extended Maclean family together in
one of their happier moments, as their mother sings traditional Celtic
folk songs in a beautiful lilting voice and a visiting uncle
(McElhinney) from the States gets drunk and joins in the singing, and
shows off the tattoo of his ex-wife on his back.</P>
<P>It is a deliberate film, doing a grand job of setting up the characters
and the tough situation they are in, with the visuals telling the story
as powerfully as it can. The graffiti
buildings, the anxious faces on the main characters searching for
something good in their life, and the invisible line that is always in
danger of being crossed, the line between real big trouble and childhood
trouble, is always one step away for these working class toughs, as the
film stresses the problems those youths in the community face.</P>
<P>The brick fights between the rival gangs and the angst of the mother,
not understanding what to do, seemed genuine, in this
semi-autobiographical work by the MacKinnon brothers, Gillies and Billy.</P>
<P>Spoiler in the next paragraph about the film's ending.</P>
<P>The film comes to its most tense moments when the confused Lex feels put
upon by the roughhouse tactics of Sloan, especially when for no reason
the gang pummels an artist friend (Walker) of Alan's, someone who had
been kind to him. Lex visits the housing project area of the Tongs,
where he accidently meets the brother of Malky, Gorbals (McConnochie),
on his way to join the gang to get even with Charlie Sloan. The story
moves along in a disarmingly violent pace -- culminating in the murder
of one of Lex's brothers, which leaves Lex guilt-ridden as the cause of
his brother's death.</P>
<P>It is a film that tried to say more than what it is capable of saying,
but when it was on message, it had a stunning affect, showing how the
lack of good parenting and a poor environment could be deadly. It caught
something real about growing up in such a rough environment, but the
acting was not that great by the kids and when all is said and done, the
brothers were made into stock characters.</P>
