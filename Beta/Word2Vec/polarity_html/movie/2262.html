<PRE>                          WE'RE BACK! A DINOSAUR'S STORY
                       A film review by James Berardinelli
                        Copyright 1993 James Berardinelli</PRE>

Released by Universal Pictures</P>
<P>     Call it JURASSIC PARK JR., although it's likely to appeal only to
a small fraction of the audience that enjoyed Steven Spielberg's summer
mega-hit.  Where that one was a thrill-a-minute ride filled with
spectacular effects and well-orchestrated tension, WE'RE BACK is an
exercise in endurance--not only is it on the dull side, but it has
such an overwhelming sense of sweetness that it threatens to become
nauseating.</P>
<P>     Young children--presumably WE'RE BACK's intended audience--will
likely enjoy the adventures of four dinosaurs and two New York youths.
It's adults accompanying their offspring who will have problems
because, even considering the short length of the film, this is the
visual equivalent of a Sominex.  To say that there's not much of
interest going on is an understatement.  While the plot is adequate for
the under-ten group, it won't do much to satisfy the older viewer.
Hopefully WE'RE BACK's single musical number, a nicely jaunty tune, is
sufficient to keep the eyelids open.</P>
<P>     The premise is simple (and simple-minded).  The oddball Captain
Neweyes (voice of Walter Cronkite) takes his "Wish Machine" back in
time to collect for dinosaurs:  a tyrannosaurus named Rex (voice of
John Goodman), a pterodactyl, a hadrosaurus, and a triceratops.  After
feeding them his "Brain Grain" cereal, Neweyes drops them into New York
harbor, charging them to reach the Museum of Natural History where
children from all over the world can have their wish to see a real
dinosaur granted.  Unfortunately, the quartet gets sidetracked by the
devious schemes of Captain Neweyes' evil brother, Professor Screweyes,
who wants the dinosaurs as the prime exhibit in his Circus of Fear.</P>
<P>     With a talented writer like John Patrick Shanley (MOONSTRUCK) at
the keyboard, I expected more than this trite, vacuous effort.  Sure,
there's an occasional line thrown in for the adults, but that hardly
makes the experience worthwhile.  The best animated films are those
that have something for viewers of all ages.  Over the years, Disney's
films have proven that "animation" doesn't equate with "juvenile."  The
creators of WE'RE BACK didn't learn the lesson, so their product turns
out to be an overly-long, big screen cartoon.</P>
<P>     The animation is serviceable, and occasionally above-average.  The
limitations of a "quickie job" are often apparent, but there are a few
nice sequences when it appears that some effort was put into the visual
aspects of the story.</P>
<P>     Whoever picked the voices for WE'RE BACK made some unusual
choices, none of which leads to an impressive or inspired performance.
Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, and veteran British comic actress
Felicity Kendal all have parts, as do the more "typical" vocal artists
John Goodman, Martin Short, and Jay Leno.  Mr. Cronkite gets an
opportunity to say "And that's the way it is...", but I don't recall
Ms. Child ever making mention of "Bon appetite."</P>
<P>     In a year when there's no new offering from Disney, the temptation
is to search for something to fill the void.  By choosing the time when
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST came out two years ago and ALADDIN last year,
WE'RE BACK is obviously making a cheap bid for this distinction.
Parents should not be fooled into thinking they're getting anything in
the same league.  If they don't mind fighting off a desire to snooze,
their kids probably will enjoy this movie.  Otherwise, THE LION KING
(Disney's next animated feature) is only six months away.  It's an
unfortunate choice to have to make.</P>
