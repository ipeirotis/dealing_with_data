<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A total remake of "Street With No Name," as this time the volatile
Samuel Fuller offers an action-packed thriller in his "House of Bamboo",
set in post-WW II Japan.</P>
<P>In 1954 an American crime syndicate, made up of ex-GI's and organized by
a devious psychopath, Sandy (Ryan), rob a train of machine guns, where
an American soldier, Webber (Biff), dies not telling who the boss of the
robbery is. But, his U.S. Army interrogators, in a joint investigation
with Japanese authorities, discover he has secretly married a Japanese
woman, Mariko (Yamaguchi). Webber tells the lead investigator, Captain
Hanson (Dexter), that if anyone should find out that he is married to
Mariko, she would be in grave danger.</P>
<P>The army assigns an undercover agent, Sergeant Eddie Kenner (Stack), who
uses the name Eddie Spanier as a cover-up for his real identity. The
real Spanier is currently in prison for armed robbery and is a good
friend of the dead soldier, Webber, from their army days. Spanier first
visits Mariko and feigns disappointment when she tells him her husband
is dead. He then goes into a Tokyo pachinko parlor and demands
protection money from the boss, but soon finds that he is being roughed
up by Sandy's ichi-ban (number one man), Griff (Cameron).</P>
<P>After he is closely checked out by Sandy, who gets a hold of his police
record through his police connections, he is taken into the gang. He
uses Mariko as his "kimono girl", someone who takes care of him
sexually. He uses her, thinking that she is someone he could trust to
get word to Captain Hanson of his activities, in case he runs into
trouble with this dangerous assignment.</P>
<P>The rule of the gang, is that if one of them gets wounded, the others
shoot him. This way no one talks if captured. On his first caper with
the gang, in a factory, the robbery turns violent and Spanier is
wounded, but Sandy against his own orders, pulls him out to safety. He
thereby comes to favor Eddie to the disgust of Griff, and the reason for
it, is that by all indications, Sandy is physically attracted to Eddie,
as there is also a hint of homosexuality in the Sandy character, as
suspicions arise due to the way he contemptuously treats the kimono
girls.</P>
<P>One of the most absurd scenes, even for Fuller, who lives to film whacky
scenes like this one, is in the teahouse, where the American gangsters
are partaking of the traditional Japanese tea ceremony and Griff is
carrying on to the ice-cold Sandy about not being close to him anymore,
ranting at him, I'm your ichi-ban, not that newcomer. Why can't I go
with you on the next job?</P>
<P>Fuller's main motifs: dual identities, betrayal, and racial conflict,
all play a major part in the playing out of the story. His busy camera
is almost perverse in catching the evil smirks of the gang members, the
crowded Ginza district's feverish atmosphere, a Kabuki troupe taking a
moment off in practice to tell a hobo like questioner that the girl he
is looking for is no longer here, the ritual of a steam bath being
trampled on by the impulsive American in a rage to find his woman, and
in the climactic scene, in an amusement park that features a whirling
globe (as if the whole world is spinning out of control), Fuller has
Eddie gun down the crime boss as the globe continues to whirl. The
shoot-out between Sandy and Eddie, comes after a robbery is aborted,
when Sandy is tipped off by his informants that the cops are waiting at
the bank, and Sandy assumes it is the jealous Grigg who ratted him out,
whom he kills while insanely telling the dead man that I know what you
did. But he soon finds out that it was Eddie who betrayed him, the one
he was willing to give all his love to. He thereby comes up with a
harebrained scheme to have the Japanese police kill Eddie for him, when
he calls them about a robbery in progress, leaving Eddie propped-up
against the wall of the place. But Eddie escapes and is reunited with
Mariko at the film's conclusion.</P>
<P>This is a particularly violent and crude noir work, whose subject matter
offers a penetrating look at the American occupation of Japan, basically
saying that what the U.S. is doing there is criminal. It also magnifies
the huge cultural bridges the two countries have and why it is so
difficult for the two countrys to get to know and trust one another.
This is highlighted by the very formal structure of the love
relationship between Mariko and Eddie, where Eddie is always viewed as a
foreigner and can't be fully accepted, no matter what he does. Their
love story left an empty feeling in the pit of my stomach, as there
seemed to be a psychological separation between the two that couldn't be
reconciled.</P>
<P>Even though the story had a lot of loose ends to it and didn't make
sense most of the time, the strangeness of the characters and the
oddness of the location made for a telling tale, a sure-fire
iconoclastic Fuller experience, for a director who just goes into a film
and grabs what he wants out of it, not caring a darn about how silly it
all looks. Fuller, as always, is resourceful and fresh. His films
guarantee the viewer a jolt or two of electricty into their nonplused
movie faces. Here, the number of jolts is much higher, thereby making
this an even juicier Fuller spectacle.</P>
