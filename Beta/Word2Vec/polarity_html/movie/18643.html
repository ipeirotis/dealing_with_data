<P>Seen May 31, 1999 on home video (rented).</P>
<P>        One of the best things about the movies is that they can make you 
really start to wonder and analyze things in your own, everyday life that you 
might not have thought much of otherwise. With some films it might be just a 
secondary issue, but with `Dark City' what we get is nearly an entire film 
committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it 
defines who we are, which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely 
beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could 
only happen in a movie.</P>
<P>        There's an old role-playing computer game called `Déja Vü' wherein 
the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is, where he 
is and how he got there. The goal is to gather as many clues as possible to 
figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict. The premise to this 
film is not unlike that game, only this time we don't have control over the 
protagonist. </P>
<P>        We begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely 
dark and dirty city (actually, it's more than just the city, it's the whole 
reality) that isn't just that neo-Gothic look (a la `Batman,' `Blade 
Runner,'), but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre 
completely. Later he will learn that his name is John Murdoch (Sewell), but 
for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not 
right. The fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling 
of paranoia and a mysterious, hurried call telling him to leave immediately 
is also very chilling.</P>
<P>        This opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the 
film and its bizarre, horrific tone. The man doesn't know who he is nor where 
he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no 
idea either we can sympathize and identify with him. In fact, this is the way 
all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character, 
their feelings, values, morals, etc. until after we've observed them for a 
while. But in this case, the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool 
towards characterization, developing the mood and outlining the story.</P>
<P>        Eventually, some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears 
that John is a serial killer wanted by the police. We met Inspector Frank 
Bumstead (Hurt), a quiet, unemotional, soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to 
have been on the trail of the killer for some time. Two other important 
characters are also introduced: Dr. Daniel P. Schreber (Sutherland), a 
neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be John's doctor; and Emma Murdoch 
(Connelly), a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of 
the old Dick Tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir 
movies. It was Schreber who contacted John for reasons that are continually 
revealed throughout the course of the film. He also contacts Emma, which 
further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex, mysterious back 
story.</P>
<P>        But absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `Dark City,' which 
is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion 
and vertigo. Everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - 
considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot, its lighting, 
art direction and overall production design, they don't seem to be able to 
afford any gratuities. However, that might also be what's keeping it from 
reaching its maximum potential. </P>
<P>        By continuing to follow John as he wanders around this strange place, 
so much unlike the real world we know, we come to realize that it's all a 
hoax. Everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by 
a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to 
somehow save themselves from extinction. But, as the film's tagline says, 
`Last night, one of us went off.'</P>
<P>        For reasons that are never clearly explained, it appears that John 
possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can 
conceive (a process known as `tuning'). The aliens, which look like very old 
bald human men with pasty skin, also possess the power en masse and use it to 
change the city every night at midnight. At the same time all the humans fall 
asleep and after the changes are made, they awake and either continue where 
they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until 
then.</P>
<P>        This premise certainly is interesting and director and 
co-screenwriter Alex Proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious 
in this regard. He does provide some explanations such as that Dr. Schreber 
is an assistant to `The Strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory 
into chemical form. The aliens mix and match the memories of the city's 
population to see who will change and who will not. In the process this 
creates for a good deal of deep, thought-provoking philosophies that could be 
applied to the real world.</P>
<P>        However, where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory 
versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is. The main 
characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder 
mystery which never actually happened, yet when they start to go through some 
of the expected emotions it comes off as distant, static and cold (mediocre 
performances by Hurt and Connelly don't help either). For example, John 
realizes Emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an 
emotional bond to her, yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot, we are 
expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other, which is also 
part of the film's climax and ending.</P>
<P>        And that's what Proyas seems to be inferring with the film, but never 
quite manages to convey in its fullest sense. Ironically, this is what made 
his first film `The Crow' work so well, which had a similar theme of 
struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical, dark 
twisted world. With `Dark City' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the 
message.</P>
<P>        Still, the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining 
and enjoyable. There's a lot to like here, most notably the sheer visual look 
and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is 
able to tell the story it does. The story as a whole is one of the most 
original to come out of Hollywood in years. `Dark City' is what the movies 
are all about - the escape from the real world.</P>
