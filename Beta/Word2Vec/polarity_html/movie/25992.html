<P>     There's something particularly delightful -- and subversive -- about
a high-concept comedy that turns into something resonant. GROUNDHOG DAY
could have been ridiculous and repetitive, but it charmed you with an
unexpectedly touching romance; BEING JOHN MALKOVICH could have been a
simplistic tale of misguided celebrity worship, but it turned into an
absurdist existential fantasy worthy of Ionesco. Hollywood excels at
selling stories in a single sentence, and we come to expect that we know
all there is to know about the film from that sentence. When it becomes
evident that there's more to a film than its marketing-savvy premise, it's
a heart-warming experience indeed.</P>
<P>     NURSE BETTY isn't as thematically rich as either GROUNDHOG DAY or
BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, and it's certainly not as thematically rich as
director Neil LaBute's dazzling debut IN THE COMPANY OF MEN. It is,
however, a peculiarly entertaining comedy that sticks in the brain for a
while longer than you expect. The high concept involves a Kansas waitress
named Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) whose dreary life and joyless
marriage to used car salesman Del (Aaron Eckhart) are balanced by her
intense devotion to her favorite soap opera, "A Reason to Love." One
night, she witnesses a murder committed by hired killers Charlie (Morgan
Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock), and something inside Betty snaps. She
escapes into a fantasy world where she was once the fiancee of "A Reason
to Love's" dashing Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear), and hits the road for
Los Angeles to find him. Meanwhile, Charlie and Wesley are on her trail,
searching for the witness to their crime.</P>
<P>     It's entirely possible that NURSE BETTY could have succeeded as a
comedy strictly on the basis of its wild premise. LaBute directs with
effective comic short-hand -- a scene portraying Del in the middle of an
affair with his secretary shows wear marks on the wall to emphasize his
recidivist philandering -- and paces his showpiece sequences with a flair
you might not expect from the misanthropic mind behind IN THE COMPANY OF
MEN. There are sharp visual gags like Betty's perky look in her bloody
nurse's outfit after performing an impromptu medical procedure, and slick
exchanges of dialogue between Charley and Wesley. The performances are not
uniformly appealing -- Rock yells without doing much acting, and Eckhart's
mullet-headed lout of a husband is as broad a stereotype as you'll find -
but the work by Zellweger, Freeman and Kinnear more than takes up the
slack. It's simply a funny comedy.</P>
<P>     Simply funny, but far from simplistic. NURSE BETTY takes the somewhat
trite notion of soap operas as vicarious life for those with unhappy lives
and twists it  into provocative knots. Zellweger's performance never once
romanticizes Betty's instability, turning her into the logically illogical
extreme of a woman whose fantasy world becomes necessary for her to cope
with her present. She's also not alone in that respect. Charlie -- played
with perfect dignity by the incomparable Freeman -- comes to idealize
Betty as the paragon of human goodness waiting for him at the end of his
last job as a killer; the short-fused Wesley, also a fan of "A Reason to
Love," turns his simple assignment into a "statement" so it has more
meaning, and rationalizes his killing by comparing himself to God. Even
George McCord, the actor who plays David Ravell, comes to love playing his
part off-screen with Betty (whom he believes to be just a really committed
Method actress looking for a job on the show). The resolution may come to
some obvious conclusions about the need to face reality, but along the way
it shows a respect for the complexity of our coping mechanisms, whatever
form they may take.</P>
<P>     With so much strong stuff at the center, it's a shame that NURSE
BETTY gets flabby around the edges. The late re-appearance of Crispin
Glover and Pruitt Taylor Vince (as a reporter and sheriff from Betty's
home town, respectively) adds little to the already dense plot but the
presence of two actors whose quirkiness can be distracting. The attempts
at entertainment industry satire don't always mesh with the edgier stuff,
and the tone shifts from intense to playful on a dime. In fact, by all
rights it should be just another affably mediocre piece of Hollywood
joke-mongering. Yet even with its bumps and scrapes, NURSE BETTY feels
like more. There's something at stake, something recognizably human,
something you don't often find in high-concept comedy. Thanks to
Zellweger, Freeman and (of all people) Neil LaBute, there's a heart here,
and a brain, too. It's an approach that takes a high concept just a bit
higher.</P>
