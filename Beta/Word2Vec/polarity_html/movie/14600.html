<P>TEMPE MILLS CINEMA, AZ--This movie had us in non-stop stitches from
beginning to end. All those promotional clips that have been on TV for
the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie. If you
thought they were funny, see the rest of the movie. It's hilarious.</P>
<P>How does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only
claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on SNL to exactly one song?
Easy. Write an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas, add
some good lines and satire, and voilà, you end up with an excellent,
well-done, very entertaining flick.</P>
<P>Will and Chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work
begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day. At night
they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in
failed attempts to get into the Roxbury in Beverly Hills, CA, the only
disco act worth going to. The only problem, the place is so popular
and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to
the front door, The Roxbury closes, all the while bearing witness to
guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like Richard Grieco
who get past the doorman without fuss.</P>
<P>The script authors (Steve Koren, Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan)
cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the Roxbury. Their
flower-shop van is rear-ended by Richard Grieco, who fears a law-suit
and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about
the car accident they just had, but not about getting into the
Roxbury. Grieco happily takes them in, even introduces them to the
owner, which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial
appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold
diggers (Elisa Donovan and Gigi Rice) who bet their time and bodies on
Will and Chris. What follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing
routines ever. The music is superb, and could have only been made
better had the producers added Patrick Hernandez's Born To Be Alive.
The Choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by, for example,
the Bee Gees and their Stayin' Alive. It is nostalgic for those of us
who remember that far back, and the technique is a clever adaptation
that worked well in Forest Gump.</P>
<P>One of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that Will</P>
<P>and Chris don't have any mone y, and dump both on the spot, even
expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away. An
art-imitates-life poke at shallow women. It's a scene that's an
approximate parody of The Vinegar's own Rolf Luedeke's editorial this
week National Organization for Men (NOM) Replaces NOW. Ted "Unabomber"</P>
<P>Kaczynski, himself rejected for not having money, will identify well
with this scene, if he ever watches the movie.</P>
<P>Of course, the script wouldn't be complicated enough without adding
Molly Shannon, the girl next door who has had a crush on Will since
they were kids, and who Will has had an aversion to in quest of
good-looking disco blondes (proof that men will turn down perfectly
good women when there are Bay Watch babes always lurking nearby).
Nevertheless, Will's father wants him to marry Molly anyway, but
thinks idiot Chris is standing in the way and sends him into
guest-quarter exile. During the wedding ceremony, Will's heart isn't
exactly into getting married, and when his brother appears on the
balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head-bopping music, Will thinks
worse of the knot-tieing idea and runs to Chris. Definitely an SNL
parody of The Graduate where Katharine Ross changed her mind for the
screaming Dustin Hoffman in the church balcony.  I found this scene a
riot, however, it went over Brandi's head -- she was born seven years
after The Graduate first appeared. The scene has a good punch line
when Molly Shannon marries, instead, the step-in buddy/weight-lifter
(who looks like he could pass for the son of Gary Busy) and who has
been lusting for a good-looker for a long time, but ready now to take
anyone. More art-imitates-life stuff -- not even muscles can
substitute for money in the real world.</P>
<P>The idiots' mother is played by Loni Anderson, whose Barbie-doll looks</P>
<P>don't play well anymore (she's a bit old), and whose cleavage looks
like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down.</P>
<P>I recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in</P>
<P>need of a lot of laughs. Go with a date. Brandi laughed non-stop, as I</P>
<P>did, and a deaf-mute might have concluded I was tickling her
continuously for 105 minutes.</P>
