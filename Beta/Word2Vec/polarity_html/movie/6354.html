<P>     Michael Ondaatje's Booker Prize-winning novel _The English Patient_
looked to be a remarkably difficult work to translate to the screen.  A
tale of intertwined lives which weaves its way through several time
periods with a lyrical, dream-like prose style, it is the kind of
narrative which could turn into a catastrophic failure as much in the
hands of a too-reverential film-maker as a completely oblivious one.  So
Anthony Minghella decided to build his own narrative around what he saw as
the crux of _The English Patient_, and in so doing he has created a
magnificent love story which gives "old-fashioned" a good name.  Though
miles removed from Ondaatje's psychological drama, Minghella's THE ENGLISH
PATIENT stands on its own as a powerful sweeping romance..</P>
<P>     THE ENGLISH PATIENT opens near the end of World War II, with a
Canadian nurse named Hana (Juliette Binoche) who has grown weary of losing
friends and lovers.  When her medical unit is moving through  Italy, Hana
decides to stay behind in an abandoned monastery with one patient, a badly
burned man who can't remember his name and is known only as "the English
patient (Ralph Fiennes).  His identity is of interest, however, to David
Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a maimed former Allied agent who believes the
English patient was the Axis spy who gave him up.  Meanwhile, in flashback
we see the patient's memories of himself as the Hungarian count Laszlo de
Almasy, a cartographer exploring the North African desert who meets
Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas), the wife of one of his
colleagues.  The two begin an affair which brings Almasy to life, but is
destined to leave him in that makeshift Italian hospital bed.</P>
<P>     Anthony Minghella's resume has thus far consisted of supernatural
romance (TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY) and blue collar romance (MR. WONDERFUL),
but THE ENGLISH PATIENT is a romance with the kind of sweep you associate
with films made, and not merely set, in the 1940s.  Ralph Fiennes turns in
a wonderfully economical performance as Almasy, a reserved man who begins
with the minimalist philosophy that "a thing is a thing" but becomes
utterly intoxicated by the first real passion in his life.  Fiennes is
exceptional behind layers of prosthetics (created by Jim Henson's Creature
Shop), and makes Almasy's later witty resignation entirely consistent with
the man he becomes in the scenes set years earlier.  Kristin Scott Thomas
matches his work with a radiant sensuality, turning the smart, perceptive
Katherine a deserving object of any man's fixation.  Thomas and Fiennes
share the kind of beautiful but intense chemistry movies seem reluctant
to show us in 1996, perhaps afraid that a cynical modern audience will not
be able to take such deeply felt emotions seriously.  It is not every
writer who would risk dialogue like "Every night I cut out my heart, but
in the morning it was full again;" it is not every director who would
stage the defining moment in a relationship -- a scene in which Almasy and
Katherine share a dance to, appropriately enough, "Where or When" -- with
virtually no dialogue, the attraction conveyed through a soul-piercing
gaze by Fiennes.</P>
<P>     Those familiar with the novel may have noticed the conspicuous
absence of Kip Singh, a Sikh bomb defuser who shares an odd affair with
Hana.  Both the character (portrayed by Naveen Andrews) and the
relationship appear in THE ENGLISH PATIENT, but their role is greatly
reduced in Minghella's account, as is that of Caravaggio.  Minghella tries
to link the two love stories in his film, but that may be the one place he
is less than successful -- he has focused his story so decidedly on Almasy
and Katherine that the peripheral characters are sometimes more
distracting than complementary.  It is to Minghella's credit, however,
that he has clarified a number of points in his streamlined narrative,
creating a uniquely powerful story, less intricate and internalized than
Ondaatje's novel but just as involving.</P>
<P>     The quality which may make THE ENGLISH PATIENT so singularly
effective is its refusal to fit into neatly-defined categories of romantic
film-making.  It is emotional, yet it is suspenseful and full of action;
it is intensely personal, yet played against a historical and geographical
backdrop filmed with bronzed grandeur by John Seale; it has moments of
utter seriousness, then subverts a tender moment with an throwaway bit of
comedy where Katherine bangs her head on a girder.  As risky as it might
be to throw around comparisons with classics, THE ENGLISH PATIENT is the
kind of combination of humor, detailed characterization, passion and
politics which recalls CASABLANCA.  Almasy and Katherine may share an
on-screen consummation which cinema could not attempt 50 years ago, but in
most other ways the central love story of THE ENGLISH PATIENT warrants
consideration among the great tragic pairings.  Minghella's risky
adaptation has paid off gloriously, proving they _can_ make 'em like they
used to.</P>
