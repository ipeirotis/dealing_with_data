4 stars (Out of 4)</PRE>
<P>Matthew Broderick and high school comedy. The two terms have been 
practically inseparable since Ferris Buehler took the day off in 1986. 
Now it is 13 years later, and Broderick has another high school comedy, 
Election, to show the world. Ferris Buehler's Day Off showed an 
educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows. It was 
light, fluffy, tasty, and sparkling clean. But Election is far 
different. This production is a dark, and frighteningly realistic one 
that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies; 
it shocks as well.</P>
<P>Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is the type of teacher that makes 
American high schools proud. He is a kind, caring, younger man who has 
built his life around Carver High School. In turn, Carver High School 
has provided a home for him. Jim has won teacher of the year no less 
than three times in his 12 year span, and is a well respected social 
studies teacher among the student body.</P>
<P>Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an intelligent, outgoing, and, to 
quote the film, "super nice" young girl. She is involved in numerous 
extracurricular activities, always has her hand up first in class, and 
is extremely popular among most of the student body. So, it is a natural 
progression when she decides to run for school president.</P>
<P>The Metzler family is an extremely wealthy one. The father, Dick (Holmes 
Osborne), owns a cement company. The mother, Jo (Jeanine Jackson), is an 
ideal housewife. And the two children, Paul (Chris Klein) and Tammy 
(Jessica Campbell), are both students at Carver High School. Paul was 
the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself, and is 
definitely a candidate for most popular person in school. Tammy is a 
lesbian who, to say the least, is going through a period of self 
discovery.     </P>
<P>For reasons of revenge, hatred, and sexual envy, Jim convinces Paul to 
run against Tracy for school president. He claims that in a democracy 
you need choices, and having Tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship 
of sorts. So Paul agrees and the race is on. But then, in an effort to 
spite the two candidates, Tammy announces that she is running as well. 
Her campaign is straightforward: People only run to put it on their 
college applications, then they do nothing. Well, "I don't even want to 
go to college," she says.</P>
<P>In Election, there are no "good guys". Almost everyone has their own 
agenda. No matter how deeply hidden, the production digs it up and 
exploits it for the audience. Tracy is the type of person that you 
remember from high school. She is the girl that would be labeled "Most 
likely to achieve anything she wants" in the yearbook, and everyone 
secretly envied her because of that. Jim is a teacher that takes the 
trust that students give him as a privilege, and uses it to his own 
amoral advantage. Everyone, including the principal, a former teacher, 
all the candidates, and even Paul's girlfriend are two sided characters. 
That is much of this film's beauty, it doesn't have the typical good 
guys that Hollywood likes, instead it is a realistic portrayal of the 
real world, specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions 
that people usually keep to themselves.</P>
<P>Matthew Broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role. His 
character is often similar Bill Murray's award winning role in the 1998 
film, Rushmore. Of the two acting jobs, Broderick's is far superior. But 
even he is overshadowed by the young Reese Witherspoon. The hatred that 
she causes the audience to develop towards her, is simply indescribable. 
Broderick and Witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing 
off each other in various scenes. One such moment occurs when she 
approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day. You can see 
her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures, 
making her an eligible candidate. And his subtle disgust with her is 
apparent, although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to 
put on a happy face.</P>
<P>The supporting cast is one with little Hollywood experience. But that is 
far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part. However, the 
real treat is Jessica Campbell in her confused role as a young 
homosexual girl. This is never more apparent than the scene where she 
delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency. 
She is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an 
unjust system is expressed.</P>
<P>If Ferris Buehler made you feel good about American high schools, and 
gave you an innocent laugh or two, then the movie achieved its goal. But 
don't you dare think that Election's goals are similar. It is just as 
real in its portrayal of high school, as its characters are in the real 
world. There certainly is no pile of marshmallows here.</P>
