<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>This is a film where the heroine could say with deep conviction that "I've seen
bodies shining like stars," and we believe her without laughing at her. It's an
unusual and fascinatingly compelling fairy tale type of drama, steeped in
feeling and intellect and romance. "Kissed" is based on the original story by
Barbara Gowdy "We So Seldom Look on Love," and directed with economy in her
first feature by Canadian Lynne Stopkewich. She has captured the nuances of a
young girl's life obsession, her ambitions, and her romantic life, in a most
tender and imaginative way. What makes this film standout, is that the subject
matter is necrophilia. It tells about a young girl, Sandra Larson (Molly
Parker), who grew up in isolation showing an abnormal interest in dead animals,
where she feels compelled to hold them in death and bury them properly. She
breaks this isolation when she meets one other friend, Carol (Jessie Winter
Mudie), who understands her secret life. But when her mother learns of how Carol
sees ghosts and has her daughter do a strange dance at the burial of the
animals, she breaks up the relationship for good. </P>
<P>As a college student Sandra decides to study embalming, and in the meantime she
quits her job for a florist and secures a job at Wallis' funeral parlor. From
Mr. Wallis (Brazeau) she learns the trade, as he methodically shows her how to
apply the techniques that go into preparing the dead and making them look serene
for the family members who will view their reposed remains. For him the dead
have no feelings, he's just someone with an unusual occupation who is good at
his job. But the janitor Jan tells Sandra that he has a secret, he was once
caught fondling a young boy corpse. This is never followed up. </P>
<P>But for Sandra the dead bodies are a means of transcendence ... it's about
'crossing over,' as she tells how she feels compelled to make love to the dead
young corpses. With a spiritual light in her eyes, Sandra expounds in a delicate
voice how every corpse is different, how each has its own innocence, grief, and
wisdom. She tells how she can feel everything from the dead body, "It's like
looking into the sun and going blind." </P>
<P>This sincere and believable young lady's life becomes even more complex when she
meets a medical student on a leave of absence, Matt (Outerbridge), and makes
love with a live person for the first time. She feels comfortable enough with
him, that she blurts out her secret: "I make love to the dead bodies." Instead
of turning her off, this driven man becomes more curious about her and her
romances with the corpses. </P>
<P>But Matt feels that he can't compete with the corpses for her undying love and
offers to pretend to be a corpse, wearing makeup and lying still, if she would
make love to him the same way she does the corpses. When she tries to tell him
that what she does is not an act and refuses to indulge his fantasy the film
turns away from her story, to its detriment, and follows Matt's needs to be
loved. It culminates in a tragic event. The reason it's a detriment, is because
her story is more dynamic and compelling than his. We have seen troubled
students like him in other films, but she's unique and mysterious and worth
pursuing in further depth. </P>
<P>One of the really amazing things about ths film is that it's all believable.
It's handled in a romantic and even comical way, allowing us to see the
characters for what they are instead of sensationalizing their fetishes. There
were three very good performances: Jay Brazeau sets a sobering tone for the
story to be grounded in reality, no matter how far-fetched it may seem. Peter
Outerbridge brings a sensitivity and restlessness to his role, as someone whose
curiosity is so great that he's willing to try something that is ghoulish. But
the film belongs to Molly Parker's absorbing translation of her role, as an
ordinary person who is compelled to do what she feels most pressing inside her.
The film comes with voice-overs from Molly, in her quiet, gentle voice, and the
photography at times becomes glowing in a heavenly whiteness or darkly pressing
in a sobering blue shade. The film always felt dreamlike, like it was a fairy
tale without a moral lesson to it. </P>
<P>The film's only fault is in how slight the story is and how it failed to go
beyond the shocking taboo point of its "crossing over" theme and really explore
that untested subject matter in more depth. But the film is still a special one
because of the freshness of its ideas, the originality of the film's theme, and
the way it was so artfully filmed. </P>
