<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>German-born director Michael Haneke ("Funny Games"/"71 Fragments of a Chronology
of Chance") continues to make fascinating and diverse films about morality. Code
Unknown is a film marked by its documentary style of filmmaking, as it attempts
to look in a realistic way at the immigration of people from all over the world
to Paris. It features an opening eight-minute tracking shot following Juliette
Binoche's Anne as she walks along the crowded Parisian streets. It hones in on a
woman who is an illegal immigrant from Romania and is begging on the streets, a
West African family consisting of their music teacher eldest son and their taxi
driving father, and Binoche as the actress who is in the middle of shooting a
film--which means there's a film within the film and each role is played by the
star actress. </P>
<P>By using shots with long-takes, the director is able to capture in the facial
expressions the various moods that strike his subjects. There's an inherent
violence in Western Europe and there's a mixture of races that can easily be
seen in the street scenes, the filmmaker tries to see how a modern European city
in the midst of such population changes for its white country handles itself. </P>
<P>In this episodic film there are several unconnected stories that seem to be
leading nowhere, but are followed through at various points of the film; the
film is devoid of plot and relies on the viewer to make their own observations
from what unfolds. The connecting point, where some of the main characters
converge, is the early scene where an alienated youth, Jean (Hamidi), humiliates
a Romanian woman (Gheorghiu) begging on the Boulevard St Germain by tossing a
crumpled bag into her lap. This inconsequential street incident gets loud when a
young black man, Amadou (Yenke), a music teacher of deaf children, takes
exception to this and chases down the thrower and tries by force to make him
apologize to the lady. This raucous incident brings out Anne, from where she's
shooting a studio film. Jean is the younger brother of her boyfriend, who has
just gotten the code to stay in her apartment that she shares with her
war-photographer boyfriend Georges (Neuvic). He's away covering the war in
Kosovo, but will soon return. Jean wants to stay with her because he just ran
away from his farmer father, upset that he has to paint a barn. When the police
arrive, the incident gets straightened out by having the beggar deported, Amadou
taken to the station for questioning, and Jean released.This incident is one
blur in the everyday streetlife scenes of multicultural Paris. </P>
<P>The film's main character is busy shooting a film where the one playing her
child nearly falls from her 20th story penthouse apartment while she is swimming
in the indoor pool with her husband. At home, she is hassled by the fact that
her boyfriend is cold to the problems she feels intense about, such as hearing
an abused child's cry in her apartment complex and not knowing who the child is.
She forces an argument with him in the supermarket, saying he's never there when
she needs him and that he doesn't care about anyone else but himself. Her most
harrowing scene is a ride in the metro, where a young Arab teenager can't stop
menacing her while the other passengers don't know how to react and pretend not
to notice, until a middle-aged Arab man confronts the troubled youth. When
Georges returns to the apartment, he finds the code has been changed. </P>
<P>In the meantime Maria has illegally been smuggled into the country to continue
to beg even though she's ashamed of what she's doing, but it helps support her
family back home and her husband Dragos approves. </P>
<P>In the final scene Amadou's class puts on a program for massed drums, a note on
which the film optimistically ends on (proving that even the deaf can hear what
music is inside them, if given a chance). </P>
<P>This is a brilliantly done art film, offering a detached view of immigration
according to the way an outsider sees it. It doesn't come to any grand
conclusions, at least none that we haven't seen before, but its way of telling
its story holds our interest and should be a rewarding film for those who have
an interest in observing things in minute details. It was an excellent idea to
have a series of long-takes so we can view the African family in action, the
Romanian woman dealing with her compatriots back in Romania and then desperately
sneaking back into Paris to try and earn some money, and how the French family
is also disengaged by the modern times. There's a sense of loss here, but
there's also an excitement about what all this change could stir up. Each
viewer's reaction will be taken from their own experiences. Some might see it
just as a film -- the way Binoche views her actress role in the film within the
film, who laughs at it when she sees herself on film. </P>
<P>There's a special emotional quality about "Code Unknown" that allows Paris to be
seen in its lies. The film convincingly shows how hard it is for different
cultures to communicate with others, and even though this has been said before
the film's method of getting to that conclusion is the thing to look for here. </P>
