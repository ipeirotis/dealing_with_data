<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The heroine in this wacky autobiography learns the hard way that it pays
to be unique, even if that might require an acceptance of her being
unhappy, if the alternative is, that happiness means that you have to be
like everyone else. The film's tone is set with a quote from Tolstoy:
"All happy families are alike; all unhappy families are unhappy in their
own way."</P>
<P>"Slums" is a sharp-witted, biting screwball comedy about a
semi-dysfunctional family who have some problems that prevents them from
being a happy family but not the kind of problems that can't be
overcome. Alan Arkin as Murray Abramowitz is a riot as a dour
65-year-old car salesman who after his divorce has been given custody of
the two boys, the high school student Ben (David) and the elementary
school student Ricky (Eli), and a vivaciously wearied 15-year-old girl,
a soon-to-be freshman in the high school, Vivian (Natasha), whose
coming-of-age experiences during the summer of 1976 will be the focus of
the film. Her wide-eyed and aghast looks at what she sees happening to
her are what give this film its particular flavor and her comical and
sad observations are right-on-target.</P>
<P>For the father, there are two things important about raising children:
they are to get a good education and live at the right address. This is
solved as this economically struggling Jewish family manages to live in
Beverly Hills even if it is only on the outskirts of town, in housing
that is not quite up to snuff. The price they pay for having a Beverly
Hills address, is that they live like nomads, often sneaking out of
their flea-bag apartments in the dead of night, rather than paying their
rent. He is so obsessed with this idea of having a Beverly Hills ZIP,
that he fails to see how he is ruining his family with his unchanging
ways.</P>
<P>Tamara Jenkins' amusing autobiographical "Slums of Beverly Hills" is an
engaging story, that centers on a young girl first becoming acquainted
with her body, her body functions, and her encounters with sex. She does
all this as she learns to live with a household of obnoxious males: a
nosy father, an older brother who is an aspiring actor and a wiseacre,
and a younger brother innocently asking impertinent questions. Murray is
a brash, intrusive, and insensitive single-parent, who means well but
overextends his good intentions and fails to see his mistakes in time.</P>
<P>The film opens as the father takes his daughter to buy her first bra.
She is concerned that her breasts have, as her father says, "sprouted
overnight.''Breasts become a big part of the story, as Vivian doesn't
know quite how to handle her newly found riches, at times, thinking she
is cursed to have such budding breasts, even going to a noted Hollywood
plastic surgeon for a "breast reduction" consultation, but at other
times, she is proud that it attracts so much attention from the opposite
sex.</P>
<P>Moving into their new apartment, which is no different than the "cheap
apartment" they just left, she meets Eliot (Kevin Corrigan), the
flirtatious kid who lives in the next apartment and who is immediately
attracted to her breasts. When she asks the seemingly historical-minded
Charles Manson T-shirted Eliot what high school he goes to, he tells her
"I dropped out of school because I wanted to join the work force,'' to
which she asks, "Doing what?'' And he replies: "Selling pot.'' He will
get to be the first to feel her up, because as she says, this is not a
serious relationship, it is just a "building thing."</P>
<P>With things not going so well for the Abramowitz family, Murray sees a
way out, as his rich brother Mickey (Carl Reiner) has a troubled
29-year-old daughter Rita (Marisa Tomei) who just escaped from a drug
rehab program and can't be controlled by him. He is willing to pay
Murray to take her in with his family and see if he can straighten her
out. This results in Murray getting Rita into a nursing program and him
taking his family to live in a posh Beverly Hills place, the first time
the family is an apartment they are not embarrassed to be at.</P>
<P>Tomei gives a wonderfully over-the-top performance as a lost soul, who
brings her quirky antics into a household that is trying to act like
"people" but can't seem to make it. She becomes buddies with Vivian,
telling her that she is pregnant and speaking with her in a gibberish
pig language which only they can understand. She becomes the big sister
to her and the female friend she desperately needs in the male house and
the one who is hip to things girls are curious about, no matter how
loopy she is. Also, in one madcap sketch, she teaches the young girl the
benefits of dancing around in a nightgown with an extra-large vibrator.</P>
<P>The family sees Beverly Hills through the demo luxury car Murray uses to
transport them after each move, as the kids look out the window and
identify the houses where the stars live, while they are usually on
their way for a steak breakfast at Sizzlers, something the father
splurges for, thinking that meal will keep the kids fit.</P>
<P>Naturally things don't work out according to Murray's plans, of living
off his brother. Rita, accurately observes, that Murray and her are
similar, they are both screwups. The two of them can't change their
errant ways. After one hectic day of nursing school, she realizes that
she is not fit for that vocation.</P>
<P>The family meets in a diner, as Mickey wishes to see what results he has
gotten from paying for Murray's expenses, anxious to question Rita about
what she has learned. But Mickey can't help from being crude and
ridiculing Murray in front of his children and when Murray is served
with a barrage of caustic comments by his brother, who repeatedly
reminds him how he is a failure and a bum, and that if it weren't for
his generosity, his kids wouldn't have clothes on their backs and
wouldn't be fed. This is too much for the vibrant Vivian to hear, as she
sticks a fork into her uncle's leg, and so ends their bourgeoisie digs.
This scene was funny but it was also very hurtful to watch. It touched
on all the nerves that made this into an intense dramatic scene, that
worked so well because the script was tight and the actors were
well-cast, with especially Natasha Lyonne, as the girl who was always
being surprised as she tries to find out who she is. She gives off hope
that she will come out of this childhood experience, scarred but not
beaten, ready to make her way in the world and embrace what her parents
have given her instead of feeling sorry for herself. She has life to
her, which Alan Arkin plays off, as he wisely plays his downbeat role
with a perfect eye for comedy, making all those around him blossom. A
small gem of a film, much better than the sitcom material it portends to
be.</P>
