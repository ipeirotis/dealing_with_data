<P>     In 1996, director Marleen Gorris, who hails from the Netherlands, 
entered the international spotlight when her 1995 feature, ANTONIA'S 
LINE, won the Best Foreign Film Oscar.  Now, two years later, Gorris' 
follow-up to that much-lauded effort has arrived in the form of MRS. 
DALLOWAY, an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's classic novel.  Because of 
its strong leading character and female-oriented themes, it's easy to 
understand why the film held such appeal for an avowed feminist like 
Gorris.  In conjunction with Vanessa Redgrave, the director paints a 
probing-but-flawed portrait of a thoughtful woman.</P>
<P>     Redgrave, who brings depth and a sense of poignant longing to 
Clarissa Dalloway, was instrumental in getting this picture made.  After 
canvassing Virginia Woolf's body of work in preparation for a stage 
role, Redgrave was struck by the potential cinematic quality of MRS. 
DALLOWAY, and suggested to screenwriter Eileen Atkins that it would make 
a good movie.  Several years later, the film has traversed the road from 
concept to feature, and, six months after making its debut at the 1997 
Toronto Film Festival, it is opening in selected theaters across North 
America.</P>
<P>     MRS. DALLOWAY is a "day in the life" motion picture that uses 
flashbacks to broaden the time span from a single day in June 1923 to a 
lifetime.  The film begins by introducing viewers to Clarissa Dalloway, 
the upper class wife of Richard Dalloway (John Standing), a wealthy 
Member of Parliament.  Clarissa, who lives a life that is safe, 
isolated, and dull, is planning a gala party for the evening, where 
guests of stature will mix and mingle, telling boring stories and 
engaging in stuffy conversation.  Clarissa is well-known for her 
parties, and they have become social events in London society.  Then 
something happens to shatter the stillness of Mrs. Dalloway's life -- a 
man named Peter Walsh (Michael Kitchen), an old flame from 30 years ago, 
shows up on her doorstep.  This leads Clarissa to think back to the 
choices she made during the summer of 1890, and how they shaped the rest 
of her life.</P>
<P>     MRS. DALLOWAY is about regrets and coping with the consequences of 
one's decisions.  Clarissa has not led a bad life -- in fact, it has 
been quite comfortable -- but she is cognizant that she gave up love and 
passion for security.  The point of the film isn't to debate whether she 
made the right or wrong decision, but to emphasize that everyone has 
roads not taken.  For Clarissa, the alternative to her pampered life of 
parties and domestic tranquillity would have been an existence of travel 
and adventure, two things that frightened her.  The greatest strength of 
MRS. DALLOWAY is that it manages to effectively capture the poignancy 
and wistful yearning of gazing back through the years at what was and 
what might have been.  Clarissa's bittersweet reminiscences are so 
powerfully-presented that they will strike a responsive with many 
viewers.  I left the film contemplating the undeniable truth of how 
quickly (and sometimes cruelly) time passes everyone by.</P>
<P>     Juxtaposed with Mrs. Dalloway's story is that of a young, shell-
shocked soldier, Septimus Warren-Smith (Rupert Graves), who has never 
recovered from his experiences in World War I.  This material, although 
thematically relevant to the main plot, causes unwanted interruptions in 
the narrative that threaten to derail the picture.  Graves plays the 
part effectively, and the story of the young man's loss of identity is 
tragic, but I found the Warren-Smith scenes to be more of a distraction 
than a crucial subplot.</P>
<P>     Not surprisingly, the acting is top-notch.  Redgrave shines, 
whether she's gazing back through the mists of the past or, in the 
film's best sequence, making pithy asides to expose the true nature of 
the guests at her party.  Michael Kitchen and John Standing are solid as 
the two men who were once rivals for Clarissa's affections, and who have 
changed very little over time.  In flashbacks, Natascha McElhone 
(SURVIVING PICASSO) brings a sparkle to the young Clarissa, and Alan Cox 
cuts a dashing figure as Peter.  The 1890 scenes also feature Lena 
Headley as Clarissa's best friend, and their are hints of a subtle 
lesbian attraction.</P>
<P>     MRS. DALLOWAY will probably appeal most strongly to those who 
appreciate Merchant-Ivory's unhurried pace.  The story, which is more of 
a character study than a plot-oriented narrative, moves slowly and 
deliberately, giving us a crystal-clear picture of the many faces of 
Clarissa Dalloway -- who she was, who she might have been, and who she 
has become.  </P>
