CARLA'S SONG (director: Ken Loach; cast: Robert Carlyle (George), Oyanka
Cabezas (Carla), Subash Sing Pall (Victor), Stewart Preston (McGurk),
Gary Lewis (Sammy), Scott Glenn  (Bradley), Margaret McAdam (George's
Mother), 1996-UK)</P>
<P>It is difficult to know what to believe is right and wrong about this
Ken Loach politico/romance film, that is guaranteed to never completely
satisfy one politically or romantically, as it takes the ruling
government's Sandinista's side (left wing) over the CIA supported Contra
(right wing) guerrilla's side in the Nicaraguan War in 1987, and it does
this as seen through the romance between an emotionally unbalanced
Glasgow bus driver, George (Carlyle), who falls for a destitute and
friendless Nicaraguan refugee to his country, Carla (Oyanka Cabezas).
Their romance is believable as long as the story remained in Scotland.</P>
<P>If loach stayed in Scotland with the story, as he does in the first half
of this film, and not transport it to Nicaragua, then we might have
gotten somewhere with this unlikely romance between the politically
unaware and insubordinate bus driver and his unpaying passenger, whose
romance starts out when an inspector gets on his bus and challenges her
for a ticket, as George comes to her aid and is given a week's
suspension for his rudeness to the inspector. By chasing after the hard
to get to know Carla, he discovers that she has troubling secrets about
her past that she refuses to talk about.These dark secrets are about her
lover she left behind, who was an activist in the Sandinista movement.
The problem is so serious, that she has twice attempted suicide in
Glasgow.</P>
<P>George takes a double-decker bus for a joy ride outside of Glasgow to
show his girlfriend the natural beauty of the Scottish lochs and
mountain sides he loved as a boy. This action will result in his
dismissal from being a bus driver. He then impulsively makes up his mind
to take her back to her country so she can resolve what is troubling
her. Once in Nicaragua he is troubled by all the killing going on around
him. The film turns into an expose of how terrible the CIA is for
backing the vicious animals who make up the Contras. Bradley (Campbell)
has the flat role of being the shill for screenwriter Paul Laverty's
liberal pronouncements about the war, as Bradley is a former CIA
operative in Nicaragua, who has now become a pacifist working for a
human rights organization. This is all trite and, for me, unlikely
stuff. The romance is put on hold till we find out what happened to
Carla's lover. Therefore the animated George of the first half of the
film, is reduced to being a passive tourist, everyone showing him a
thing or two about their country, and the film flounders, caught between
a soft romance and a soft political treatise, accomplishing neither one
very successfully. George does manage to see how close-knit and joyous
the Nicaraguans can be, despite the poverty of their country, as he goes
dancing with the village people. And to George's credit, he knows when
enough is enough, so he resolves things with Carla, hears her song, as
she resolves things with her tortured lover, who she at last finds out
from Bradley, is still alive. George does the sensible thing for a
highly emotional person to do, he splits from here and heads for
Glasgow, supposedly a better person for having loved abandoningly and
made a little bit more politically aware of how bad the Contras are by
his unexpected adventure. I expect that he'll really have something to
say in the pubs when he gets back home, where he belongs.</P>
<P>It really wasn't that bad of a film, it was just too flat and preachy.
But it was pleasant to watch Oyanka Cabezas, she was quite innocently
alluring, giving her role an authentic tone to it, as there were moments
when the story seemed to be reaching for something important to say, and
that she would be the best spokesperson to present the cause. But in the
end, the film never managed to be all that convincing, probably because
it sold its product too hard. And that is unfortunate, because I didn't
learn anything new about the Nicaraguan political situation that I
didn't know before. Everything seemed too pat, more like a Stanley
Kramer liberal political film than a former Ken Loach politically
independent film, such as his LAND AND FREEDOM.</P>
