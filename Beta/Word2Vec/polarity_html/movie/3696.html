                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Watching SEX, DRUGS, AND DEMOCRACY, I was reminded of a junior high 
school lesson about term paper writing -- it's possible to agree with a 
thesis even when it's not convincingly argued.  That's precisely the 
case with this documentary, a collection of talking head interviews and 
supposedly-adventurous camera shots designed to defend director/producer 
Jonathan Blank's views on everything from legalized prostitution (which 
he supports) to gun control (which he doesn't).  Blank may have my 
sympathy on several issues, but his method of justifying them is 
patently ineffective. </P>
<P>     SEX, DRUGS, AND DEMOCRACY centers on some important, interesting 
subjects.  Is it simple pragmatism or moral degeneracy that has led the 
Dutch government to legalize prostitution?  (Blank's conclusion:  the 
former)  Does tolerating open distribution of marijuana limit hard drug 
addiction?  (Blank's conclusion:  Yes)  Would the Netherlands' solution 
work in countries with different cultures?  (Blank's conclusion:  Of 
course)  Legitimate arguments on each of these questions could fill up a 
number of feature-length documentaries.  Unfortunately, Blank isn't 
especially interested in delving beneath the surface of these fertile 
subjects, preferring simplistic solutions to intelligent analysis.   </P>
<P>     The film comes across as both a veiled attack on the United States 
and a piece of propaganda for the Netherlands.  After viewing this 
portrait of paradise, who wouldn't want to pack up and move to 
Amsterdam?  More than once, I wondered if some Dutch tourist agency 
hadn't partially funded the project -- not that much funding was 
necessary, considering that the picture was made on a shoestring budget.  
Half the footage was shot on video of such appalling quality that most 
of us would reject it for home movies.  HOOP DREAMS and JUPITER'S WIFE 
have proven that videotaped sequences can work effectively in feature 
documentaries.  Not so here. </P>
<P>     SEX, DRUGS, AND DEMOCRACY is not barren of intelligent points -- 
it's just that most of them are buried deeply beneath mounds of spurious 
hype and thinly-supported, one-sided arguments.  Not to mention that all 
of this stuff has been covered in other, better-produced PBS programs.  
Because of its inclusion of hard-core porn excerpts, SEX, DRUGS, AND 
DEMOCRACY is unlikely to be released on video.  Even so, there's no 
compelling reason to catch the movie during its limited theatrical run --
both money and time could be better spent elsewhere. </P>
