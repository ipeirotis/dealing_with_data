<P>     As is true of almost any historical event of social or cultural 
significance, the war in Vietnam has spawned numerous motion pictures.  
>From the juvenile exploitation of Chuck Norris' MISSING IN ACTION flicks 
to the powerhouse dramas PLATOON and APOCALYPSE NOW, almost every genre 
has had its Vietnam War representative.  For the most part, however, the 
role of the black soldier has been overlooked or ignored--at least 
until now.  Though no one will confuse Preston Whitmore's sporadically 
effective THE WALKING DEAD with the emotionally-bruising GLORY, this film 
does for Vietnam what Edward Zwick's epic did for the Civil War.   </P>
<P>     The most apparent weakness in Whitmore's film is its forced 
structure, which incorporates character-building flashbacks into a fairly 
routine war story.  With its unfortunate need to meticulously set up 
every scene, the screenplay has an overplotted feel that seems like the 
byproduct of a script-by-numbers design.  And, while it's critical to 
learn the protagonists' backgrounds, the manner in which their stories 
are presented comes across as a writer's artifice. </P>
<P>     The film centers around five Marines who are all-but-abandoned on
a suicide rescue mission.  In fact, they are decoys, not really
expected to survive.  In command is Sergeant "Rev" Barkley (Joe
Morton), a tough-talking, no-nonsense, ex-preacher whose past harbors a
dark secret.  Despite his superior rank, however, Barkley doesn't go
unchallenged in his authority, and most of the insubordination comes
from Pvt. Hoover Branche (Eddie Griffin), an angry young man who
professes an unwillingness to make any friends in 'Nam.  A frequent
object of dissention is Cpl. Pippins (Roger Floyd), a veteran soldier
driven over the brink by the horrors of combat.  Pfcs. Brooks (Vonte
Sweet) and Evans (Allen Payne), a pair of relatively "normal" guys,
round out the group.</P>
<P>     THE WALKING DEAD has moments of emotional candor, but much of
     what's on screen is derivative.  The internal conflicts, petty
jealousies, and inevitable bonding are all familiar plot devices.  And
the method of unwrapping personalities one-by-one is more intrusive
than effective.  Once the shooting starts, we want to stay "in country"
with the protagonists, not go wandering through old memories.</P>
<P>     Although Allen Payne gets top billing, Joe Morton and Eddie
     Griffin anchor the viewer's perspective.  The tension between
Branche and Barkley crackles, in large part due to strong
performances.  If there's a weak link, it's Vonte Sweet, who doesn't
have the screen presence to engender any real sympathy for his
character.  In the end, Brooks is just another potential corpse waiting
to be cut down.</P>
<P>     The ultimate message of THE WALKING DEAD--that war is about
survival, not glory--is a theme that filmmakers have constantly turned
to the Vietnam War for.  This time, however, it's not whites facing the
front lines, but blacks, and this movie's willingness to examine the
issue of race in the war lends a measure of significance to an
otherwise mundane picture.  It's not an exaggeration to state that the
most provocative elements of Whitmore's film have less to do with what
the soldiers face in Vietnam than why these particular men are there in
the first place.</P>
