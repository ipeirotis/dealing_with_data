<P>"Presenting the play uncut has allowed the characters to reveal even 
more, and we discover extra details about them which are usually lost on 
stage.  The political situation becomes clearer, and Hamlet is revealed 
as a knowledgeable man of the theater in his discussion of the boy 
actors.  We can convey a stronger sense of Denmark as a country ill at 
ease with itself, where there is indeed something rotten and disjointed.  
The restored lines are not mere padding, but reinforce the idea that the 
play is about a national as well as domestic tragedy."
          -- Kenneth Branagh</P>
<P>     The play, "Hamlet", by William Shakespeare, was first performed 
around 1600.  Since then, it has proven to be one of the English 
language's most enduring stories, and there has never been a decade that 
hasn't seen dozens of new productions.  "Hamlet" has come to the screen 
numerous times, in incarnations varying from early, silent versions to 
grand, color epics.  Legendary actors John Gielgud, Richard Burton, and 
Laurence Olivier have taken the lead role.  Now, as the curtain falls on 
the 1996 movie season, another HAMLET has opened.  And, in a statement 
that I do not make lightly, this latest version is not only the best 
filmed adaptation of "Hamlet" I have ever seen, but the best cinematic 
expression that I have come across of any of Shakespeare's plays.</P>
<P>     "Hamlet" has been something of a private obsession for Kenneth 
Branagh since, at the age of eleven, he first saw it on British TV.  
Even when HENRY V was an international sensation, he was adamant that 
his true dream was to bring an unabridged version of "Hamlet" to the 
screen.  Now, half a decade later, after directing HENRY V and MUCH ADO 
ABOUT NOTHING and co-starring in OTHELLO, that vision has been realized.  
Branagh's HAMLET, filmed in 70 mm, has arrived in all its glory, and, 
with every line from the original play intact, it takes approximately 
four hours to run.  It is a well-spent four hours.</P>
<P>     Part of the enduring appeal of "Hamlet" lies in its complex 
characterization and twisty, tragic plot.  "Hamlet" deals with, among 
other things, madness and revenge, sex and love, politics and treachery, 
and ghosts, both real and figurative.  Yet, despite the depth and weight 
of the issues it essays, there is still a great deal of humor and good, 
old-fashioned adventure.  "Hamlet" can quite literally make you laugh 
and cry, hiss and cheer.  It also contains a slew of famous lines, 
including, but not limited to the likes of "Frailty, thy name is 
woman!", "To thine own self be true", "Something is rotten in the state 
of Denmark", "Brevity is the soul of wit", "The play's the thing", "The 
lady doeth protest too much", and, of course, "To be, or not to be, that 
is the question."</P>
<P>     The story centers on Hamlet (Branagh), a thirty-year old Prince of 
Denmark during the twelfth century, who is mourning the death of his 
beloved father (Brian Blessed) and the untimely (and, according to 
custom, unseemly) wedding of his mother, Gertrude (Julie Christie), to 
his uncle, Claudius (Derek Jacobi).  Hamlet sees his mother's sudden re-
marriage as a betrayal of her union with his father, but worse news is 
yet to come.  An apparition, appearing in the shape of Hamlet's father, 
haunts Elsinore Castle, and when Hamlet confronts the ghost, it claims 
to be the true spirit of the late king, doomed to walk the Earth for a 
set time.  It also states that, by using a fast-acting, deadly poison, 
Claudius committed murder to claim both queen and crown for himself.  
Hamlet vows revenge, and thus begins either his slow spiral into madness 
or his carefully orchestrated act to appear insane.  </P>
<P>     The peripheral issues of "Hamlet" are no less interesting.  
Fortinbras (Rufus Sewell), the nephew of the King of Norway, is massing 
armies to attack Denmark.  Ophelia (Kate Winslet), Hamlet's lover, has 
been forbidden to have any further contact with the prince.  A group of 
traveling actors has come to Elsinore.  And two old school mates of 
Hamlet's have been employed by Claudius to betray their old friend.  </P>
<P>     One of the things that Branagh brings to his adaptation of the play 
is an amazing visual sense.  From start to finish, this is a stunningly 
beautiful film, filled with vibrant colors, startling camera angles, and 
costumes and production values that are among the best of the year.  
Even if the story was weak (which it isn't), HAMLET would be worth 
seeing for its pure visual splendor.  And, although the dress and 
settings are those of late-eighteenth century England, no part of the 
film seems anachronistic.  Cinematically time-shifting Shakespeare's 
plays has become popular of late (see Ian McKellan's RICHARD III or the 
recent ROMEO AND JULIET), but Branagh has surpassed everyone.  With an 
unflagging attention to detail, HAMLET demands to be noticed.</P>
<P>     Yet, even amidst the spectacle of the visual elements, the 
narrative is not upstaged.  A key to great cinema is to use time and 
place to augment the story, and that's what Branagh accomplishes here.  
We are not so enraptured by the stunning appearance of Elsinore's 
terraced throne room that we lose sight of Hamlet's pain, Gertrude's 
uncertainty, Polonius' foolishness, or Claudius' guilt.  From the wintry 
snowscapes surrounding the castle to the desolation of a graveyard, the 
settings emphasize, but never overwhelm, the action.</P>
<P>     For his version of HAMLET, Branagh has assembled a top-notch 
international cast.   Well-known actors like Charlton Heston (as the 
Player King), John Gielgud (Priam), Judi Dench (Hecuba), Billy Crystal 
(First Gravedigger), Gerard Depardieu (Reynaldo), Jack Lemmon 
(Marcellus), and Robin Williams (Osric) fill small roles.  Most are 
adequate, and a few (Heston and Crystal in particular) are excellent.  
Only Robin Williams, affecting a silly accent and even sillier 
mannerisms, stands out as an obvious concession to commercial pressure.  
Williams is out-of-place, but his presence is only the smallest of 
blemishes on a wonderful production.</P>
<P>     The leads are all in peak form.  Michael Maloney (Laertes) and 
Nicholas Farrell (Horatio), both of whom appeared in Branagh's A 
MIDWINTER'S TALE, give strong performances.  Richard Briers, another 
long-time collaborator of Branagh's, adds layers of guile and 
intelligence to his interpretation of the fatuous Polonius.  Brian 
Blessed makes us feel the power and malevolence of the ghost.  Julie 
Christie's wonderful Gertrude allows us to understand why Claudius would 
resort to murder to win her.  And Derek Jacobi's cultured, politically 
savvy, yet privately tortured Claudius is richly portrayed and worthy of 
Oscar recognition.  </P>
<P>     Then there's Kenneth Branagh, the film's undisputed star.  The 
actor's emoting, which has been a problem in less-theatrical productions 
such as MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN (in which he was hopelessly over-
the-top), works to perfection here.  For Hamlet's calmer, quieter scenes 
(such as the soliloquies), Branagh brings a contemplative and 
introspective quality to his performance.  But, for the emotionally-
rousing sequences, his interpretation is brash and forceful, drawing us 
into the pure drama of the situation and raising the hairs on our necks.  
It's a marvelous portrayal that compliments those of the many other cast 
members.</P>
<P>     By using some creative license, usually in the form of flashback 
visuals without dialogue, Branagh adds more dimension to several of the 
characters.  He shows scenes of domestic tranquillity in Elsinore years 
ago, with Gertrude, Old Hamlet, and the young prince playing games and 
laughing at the jests of Yorick, while Claudius lingers ominously in the 
background.  In a moment that elucidates the true nature of their 
relationship, we're shown Hamlet and Ophelia in bed.  And, with the 
ghost's words serving as a voiceover narrative, we see Claudius murder 
his brother and predecessor.</P>
<P>     Briefly, I want to mention a few of the many scenes that arrested 
my attention.  The first, which may be the most majestic moment in the 
entire film (and which is used for the theatrical poster), occurs during 
the departure of Gertrude and Claudius from Elsinore's audience chamber 
under a hail of flower petals while Hamlet, dressed in black, watches 
bleakly from behind them.  Then there's the sequence where Hamlet 
encounters his father's ghost.  The earth splits open, fire belches 
forth, mists coalesce, and the forest reverberates with the unearthly 
voice.  Hamlet's "Get thee to a nunnery" confrontation with Ophelia is 
tense and emotionally wrenching.  The graveyard scene, which opens the 
final act, is perfectly realized, especially as Hamlet recognizes the 
body in the coffin.  Finally, the climax is handled with the right mix 
of drama and adventure, and includes a nice nod to Errol Flynn.</P>
<P>     From the moment it was first announced that Branagh would attempt 
an unabridged "Hamlet", I never for a moment doubted that it would be a 
worthy effort.  After all, his previous forays into Shakespeare have 
been excellent.  Nothing, however, prepared me for the power and impact 
of this motion picture. Hyperbole comes easily when describing this 
HAMLET, decidedly the most impressive motion picture of 1996.  Nothing 
else this year has engaged my intellect, senses, and emotions in quite 
the same way.  I have seen dozens of versions of this play (either on 
screen or on stage), and none has ever held me in such a grip of awe.  
This may be Branagh's dream, but it is our pleasure.</P>
