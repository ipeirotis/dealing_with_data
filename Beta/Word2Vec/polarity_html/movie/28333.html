<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Pola X is a film by the 39-year-old French director Léos Carax (The
Lovers on the Bridge), who is noted for being an inspired madman. It is
adapted from Herman Melville's 1852 novel Pierre (Pola is the acronym of
the French title of Melville's novel, X stands for the tenth draft of
the screenplay which writer/director Leos Carax completed). It is a film
about madness and excesses, topics that are always fuzzy to portray on
the screen. It's set in modern France though it starts out looking like
a romantic 19th century literary work, where its background is a rich,
idyllic country setting in Normandy of palatial chateaus void of modern
traffic. We know it's modern times only because the protagonist rides a
motorcycle and uses a computer.</P>
<P>The story is about a pampered, handsome blond young man, Pierre
(Guillaume Depardieu, son of Gerard), a wealthy upper-class egotist who
has written a best-selling mystery novel under the pseudonym Aladin and
lives in his deceased diplomat father's chateau with his mother Marie
(Catherine Deneuve).</P>
<P>He has a very open relationship with his attractive, controlling mother
whereby they closely confide in each other keeping no secrets,
addressing each other intimately as brother and sister, and where he
feels free enough to converse with her while she's taking a bath. Their
relationship appears to be either completely innocent of any sexual
deviation, or perhaps of a incestuous one.</P>
<P>Pierre's girlfriend is his wealthy, attractive, blonde cousin Lucie
(Delphine Chuillot), also a child of an aristocrat, living in close
proximity to him in a chalet. They are soon to be married, and their
love is brimming with the joy of a storybook romance. Just returning
from doing a stint on the Chicago Stock Exchange, is his best-friend and
cousin, Thibault (Laurent Lucas), who shows a satanic jealousy that
Pierre has what he wants and is taking Lucie away from him. At one point
of the conversation between Pierre and him, he refers to them as "the
three inseparables," but the other two don't seem to share that same
feeling.</P>
<P>Pierre is stalked by someone he mysteriously only sees through the
shadows. But he has dreams about this mystery person being very
important to him. When he encounters this ghoulish looking women dressed
as a peasant, after chasing her down with his motorcycle, she goes into
a monologue about being raised in the woods and that she's the secret
child of his father's. It turns out she's an eastern European war
refugee named Isabelle (Katerina Golubeva), who claims to be his
half-sister. He suddenly decides to leave Lucie and give up his wealth
to live as lovers with the impoverished Isabelle, who is distinguished
by her straggly long brown hair falling over the side of her face so
that she is never clearly seen. She becomes his muse and his destroyer.
They also bring along with them to Paris an eastern European vagrant
mother with her little daughter. They stay for a while in the Hotel
Ahab, located in a seedy part of Paris, where he plans to write another
novel using his new found truths he found locked up in himself. But when
the young girl is killed after telling a passer-by that he stinks,
Pierre and Isabelle make arrangements to live in seclusion among a group
of terrorists and guerrilla theater musicians in a huge warehouse in the
outskirts of Paris.</P>
<P>This is a unique film, that has an inexplicable brilliance to it that
defies reason and its soap opera melodramatics. It is precious film,
though parts of it may not be pleasing or deciferable. But there is an
intelligence it has about it that should overcome all doubts about its
excesses: as the film goes from showing Pierre's change from being a
self-indulgent aristocrat to his complete breakdown as a self-indulgent
raving lunatic.</P>
