<P>     The bayous of Louisiana are a strange and wonderful place -- a 
world unto their own, overflowing with a wealth of story and thematic 
possibilities.  Whether it's the heated mystery of THE BIG EASY, the 
nonstop action of HARD TARGET, or the gory scares of CANDYMAN, the cajun 
state has attracted projects in search of a setting like no other in 
North America.  It is here, amidst the darkly beautiful swamps, that 
first-time director Kasi Lemmons has set EVE'S BAYOU, a fascinating tale 
of guilt, consequences, and voodoo.</P>
<P>     One of the most important rules of writing -- whether it's 
screenwriting, article writing, or book writing -- is to start with a 
compelling first line.  EVE'S BAYOU takes that lesson to heart, opening 
with this refrain:  "Memory is a selection of images.  Some elusive, 
others printed indelibly on the brain.  The summer I killed my father, I 
was ten years old…"  The moment the narrator speaks these words, our 
curiosity is piqued, and, for the next 100 minutes, our attention is 
engaged as we ponder their significance.  The next time they are 
uttered, in the film's closing frames, they have acquired new meaning.</P>
<P>     Beginning with this preamble, EVE'S BAYOU takes us to the Tennessee 
Williams country of the deep south and introduces us to the rarest of 
motion picture institutions:  an affluent black family.  (Judging by the 
movies, most blacks live in inner city ghettos.)  Ultimately, however, 
this film is not about skin color, but about the deeply-rooted bonds 
that join women together, which not even the most tragic of mistakes can 
obliterate.  The setting -- a small town in Louisiana during the 1950s -
- serves its purpose, but the themes broached by the writer/director are 
anything but parochial in nature.</P>
<P>     The focus of the film is on the five-member Batiste family.  
There's Louis (Samuel L. Jackson), a prominent and respected doctor; Roz 
(Lynn Whitfield), the beautiful, elegant mother of a son and two 
daughters; and their children -- 14-year old Cisely (Meagan Good), 10-
year old Eve (Jurnee Smollett), and 9-year old Poe (Jake Smollett).  
Members of the extended family, particularly Louis' mother (Ethel Ayler) 
and sister, Mozelle (Debbi Morgan), are never far away.  On the surface, 
Louis is the perfect husband and father, but he doesn't pay much 
attention to his marriage vows.  His wife, who knows of his 
indiscretions, conveniently looks the other way, but, when his daughter 
Eve catches him in the act, the issue becomes a festering sore in the 
family's stability.  The situation is further exacerbated when Cisely's 
near-worshipful affection for her father threatens to cross a forbidden 
barrier and when a voodoo priestess (Diahann Carroll) predicts disaster.  
"Look to your children," she cryptically intones to a frantic Roz.  </P>
<P>     EVE'S BAYOU deals frankly with the consequences of actions -- 
there's no moralizing or condescending to the audience.  Louis pays both 
an emotional and a tangible price for his many affairs.  Cisely's 
clouding of the truth has its own unfortunate result.  And an ill-
considered yet passionate decision on Eve's part has devastating 
ramifications.  The film also makes a point of showing that everything 
is not as it seems, especially in the tangled web of family 
relationships.  Lemmons applies the technique of the unreliable narrator 
to several sequences to illustrate how a slight change in perception can 
alter the impact of a scene.  On two occasions, she presents events from 
varying viewpoints to demonstrate that minor differences can lead to a 
vastly different interpretation.</P>
<P>     The strongest element of EVE'S BAYOU is the character interaction.  
Every member of the family (except young Poe) is developed into a unique 
individual, and all of the relationships are well-defined.  The changes 
that occur are perfectly reasonable.  What family doesn't go through an 
upheaval when secrets come into the open?  The low-key plot, with its 
elements of voodoo and spiritual sight, allows us to the opportunity to 
get to know the Batistes.  Lemmons' fine writing is complimented by a 
series of strong performances.  Samuel L. Jackson, whose involvement was 
critical to getting EVE'S BAYOU made, is as solid as ever in a role that 
requires a less-flamboyant portrayal than we have become accustomed to.  
Lynn Whitfield radiates cool beauty while Debbi Morgan emanates sensual 
heat.  Jurnee Smollett and Meagan Good, the young actors playing Eve and 
Cisely, are both believable as sisters with close ties and hidden 
jealousies.  Smollett captures the essence of a 10-year old without ever 
seeming too cute or precocious.</P>
<P>     If there's a weakness in EVE'S BAYOU, it's that the setting isn't 
used as effectively as it could be.  Placing the film in and around the 
swamps of Louisiana affords a rich opportunity for atmosphere that isn't 
utilized.  Several throwaway shots of reeds and water establish the 
location, but do little to imbue the bayou with a life of its own.  
Also, Lemmons' occasional use of collages of black-and-white images 
seems a little too artsy.  Thankfully, the voiceover is confined to the 
beginning and end, and the writer/director obeys one of the most 
important tenants of film making:  show, don't tell.  </P>
<P>     A subtle picture that treads a delicate line between drama and 
psychological thriller, EVE'S BAYOU is refreshing in that doesn't 
attempt to replicate Hollywood's ideal "black" film (either a bawdy sex 
comedy or an urban drama).  Rather than perpetuating racial stereotypes, 
EVE'S BAYOU defies them, creating several well-rounded characters and 
placing them in a deceptively complex story that builds to a forceful 
conclusion.  It's a movie like no other on the market today, and 
deserves to find its audience.</P>
