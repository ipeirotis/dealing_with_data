<P>     In the ongoing tastes-great-less-filling verbal war of attrition
between John Q. Critic and Joe B. Average Movie-Goer, a crucial
common ground often gets overlooked.  On the same fundamental level, every
one of us loves to be taken somewhere we've never been before, to be told
a story in a way it's never been told before.  Movies are our eyes to 
previously unseen worlds, whether that new world is the surface of an
asteroid, the deck of the Titanic, or behind the lines with World War II
soldiers.  At their most engrossing, movies offer the giddy thrill of the
utterly new.</P>
<P>     At its most engrossing, that's exactly what ROUNDERS offers:  a
fascinating glimpse inside the world of high-stakes poker.  Our tour guide
is Mike McDermott (Matt Damon), a brilliant young rounder (i.e., a
professional who makes the rounds at local poker games) who loses a
$30,000 bankroll on one bad night.  Nine months later, Mike is walking the
straight-and-narrow, having sworn off the game at the insistence of his
girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol) and devoted himself to his legal studies.
But trouble is just around the corner in the person of Mike's old pal Worm
(Edward Norton), just out of prison with an ever-accumulating gambling
debt hanging around his neck.  In order to save that neck -- and his own
when he makes the mistake of vouching for Worm -- Mike has to get back
into the game and use every trick he ever learned to win the biggest games
of his life.</P>
<P>     And oh, how much we learn while he does so.  Writers David Levien and 
Brian Koppelman use Damon's narration much the same way Ray Liotta's
narration was used in GOODFELLAS -- as a sociology lesson.  We learn why
Texas hold-'em is the high stakes game of choice, how real players lure
the amateurs into big pots, and how Mike spots the "tells" of his
opponents to help make his playing decisions.  It's utterly fascinating, 
whether the setting is a back alley card room or a gaudy Atlantic City
casino.  Damon anchors the story in a solid performance as a man beginning
to understand that he has a gift, not a problem.  Though hooked on the
thrill of winning, he's no different than a performer hooked on the thrill
of an audience's reaction.  Through his eyes we see poker as an art, not
an addiction.</P>
<P>     ROUNDERS has such a solid hook that it's disappointing to watch it
drift into a handful of distracting sub-plots.  The relationship between
Mike and Jo is too vaguely defined for their fate to matter, yet director
John Dahl (THE LAST SEDUCTION) lingers on their confrontations as though
the obligatory love story were dramatically potent.  John Turturro's role
as the small-time gambler who acts as Mike's mentor is also 
under-developed, as is the potentially compelling interaction between Mike
and an understanding law professor (a very good Martin Landau).  Even the
old-school chemistry between Damon and Norton -- full of almost-charming,
can't-help-myself sleaze as the compulsively crooked Worm -- feels less
genuine than it should.</P>
<P>     If anything positive comes out of these half-formed relationships,
it's the sense that Mike's best friend is really the game.  Damon's
charisma is never more potent than in the climactic showdown with the
Russian gangster who beat him in the game that broke him (John Malkovich,
employing his dead eyes to perfect effect and a Boris Badinov accent with
considerably less success).  It's a confrontation where Mike's life is on
the line, but the drama is always in the game, not the potential outcome.
For that confrontation, the narration grows conspicuously silent at key
points, trusting you to grasp the game to which you have been introduced.
Viewers who used to think of poker simply as gambling may have to re-think
their position after sitting through ROUNDERS.  This tale shows us a
different world entirely -- the world of card-player as tortured artist.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 high stakes:  7.</PRE>
