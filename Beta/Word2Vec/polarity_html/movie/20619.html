<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Who finds in life what they dream of? This emotionally moving film will
look into that and will also examine the heart aches of two working
class girls, doing it in a way only the French can do it justice.</P>
<P>The petite 21-year old Isa (for Isabelle), who is  loaded down with a
full backpack, wanders into the cold and grey industrial city of Lille.
She hopes to stay with a male friend, but finds out he's in Belgium, and
ends up remaining in Lille for the night. She hopes to pick up some cash
by selling touristy postcards on the street, which leads to an encounter
with a Yugoslavian who tells her about a sewing job in a clothing
factory. Isa, being unskilled, gets fired after working there only one
day, but not before meeting a fellow seamstress, Marie (Regnier), who is
the same age.</P>
<P>Isa is someone we think we know but really don't, as she is prone to be
friendly and willing to make relationships, opening her dark saucer eyes
wide and offering an engaging smile full of her milky white teeth to go
along with her warm personality and trim look of close-cropped black
hair; but, we are, also, distracted by a mysterious scar she has on her
right eyebrow, which is never explained. There are many things about Isa
that are unexplained and delightfully mysterious that we accept from her
because she is so genuinely likable.</P>
<P>Marie reluctantly puts her up in a beautiful apartment, one that she is
minding for a mother and a daughter lying comatose in the hospital after
a car crash.The mother will die, leaving the teenage girl with no
visitors except for Isa who takes it upon herself to make contact with
the girl in the hospital. These encounters brilliantly show what Isa is
all-about, as she wants to will the girl back to life. For Isa, life
holds so much promise and light and love in it, that misery alone cannot
stop her thoroughly from the angelic path she is on. The journey becomes
for her only a question if her dreamlife can become her real life, as
she will seek the ideal and not be deterred by what roadblocks stand in
her way, which is something the young can do more readily than the
elderly. By the end of the film, we wonder what will become of her, as
the camera pans the sad faces of the women who work all their lives in a
factory, where Isa might have no choice but to end up working in and be
exploited by the bosses, as it seems that is the pattern of life for a
working girl here.</P>
<P>Her relationship with Marie is not a very warm one, instead it is a
workable one. Marie is not a trusting or caring person; in fact, she is
most of the time a downer who expects the worst in life and when that
happens she can't properly handle it without becoming crazy.</P>
<P>The tall and slender Marie is very attractive but she is also very
mixed-up emotionally. Sex is the only thing that can bring her joy in
this world. Her relationship with the more spiritually minded Isa is
based more on convenience than on  mutual admiration or anything else,
since they are both impoverished and seem to be stuck because of their
lack of education and inability to fit into society and their inability
to meet a guy who they love or who can love them in return. They are
working-class girls, seemingly trapped by their birth, unable to get
what they want from life. Each one dreams of a way out; but Isa, as hard
as it is to believe from her appearance, is the one more grounded in
reality, the one better prepared to make a go of it in life, and she is
the one who grows up right in front of us.</P>
<P>Their encounter with the opposite sex comes on their first night
together, as they try to crash a rock concert without having a ticket,
but two rough-looking bouncers keep them out while flirting with them.
The girls are not attracted to the guys and tell them so in a nasty way,
but the relationship changes to one of friendship after much banter back
and forth. Marie ends up going out with the one she insultingly called
fat, Charly (Mercado), and sleeps with him but tells him she doesn't
like him enough to have sex with him (she will have sex with him twice,
on later occasions); while the other bouncer, Fredo (Prestia), is
smitten with the cute Isa, but to no avail, as she is not taken with him
and does not encourage the relationship to go any further than
friendship. The guys feel sorry for the penniless girls; also, they want
to keep up a relationship with them, so they give them some money to
help them out.</P>
<P>The supposed meal ticket and way out of the trap Marie is in comes about
unexpectedly, as she gets caught shoplifting a leather jacket and meets
again Chriss (Colin), she once randomly approached him in the street in
a hostile manner when she was in a playful mood. He pays for the jacket,
which she accepts with hostility. She is someone who is terribly
concerned about appearances and being humiliated, constantly unhappy
about her station in life. He will turn out to be a womanizer, and she
will be one more girl in his series of conquests, but is too blinded by
her own dreams to see this, though all the signs are there. His
nightclub (his father bought it for him) happens to be the place where
the girls' bouncer friends work.</P>
<P>Isa, in need of money, tucks in her pride and takes on the temp job of
dressing like a fool, putting on roller-skates and advertising
sandwich-boards. Marie, however, will not. She can't handle the
demeaning nature of the job.</P>
<P>A steady rift grows between the women, as Marie thinks she's got what
she wants with her relationship with Chriss and doesn't need Isa
anymore, and acts hostile toward her. All Isa is trying to do is clue
her friend into not falling for Chriss, telling her that he will only
drop her when he wants to, these remarks only make Marie more insulting
towards her. There is a classic look of disgust on the face of Isa, that
seems to be saying, you are really sick, when she finally realizes that
she has to move on from here.</P>
<P>The performances of the two actresses was bewitching, as the two women
deservedly shared Best Actress honors last year at Cannes.</P>
<P>The poignancy and merits of the film, are in depicting accurately the
reality of the girls' lives. It is a film without one false note of
sympathy or sentimentality in it. This is not the type of a girl-buddy
movie as seen in some Hollywood films of late, filled with glibness and
glitter and canned experiences. Here, what happens has the ring of truth
to it and is powerful in the sense that its simple telling of the tale,
without trying to be cute or pedantic, turns out to be profound. It
caught a certain inexpressible joy there is to life, the kind of joy
where one can connect with someone else and feel satisfied in doing that
because what you are doing is true, just like Isa did when she
befriended the girl in the coma.</P>
<P>This debut film for the 42-year-old director, done with the austerity of
a master, reminiscent of someone like a Robert Bresson, is a work of
considerable merit. It is a film that not only depicted the shattering
of a friendship and a realistic look at life for the working class, but
it probed into the deep seated loneliness found within each of the
girls, looking at it in a poetic way.</P>
