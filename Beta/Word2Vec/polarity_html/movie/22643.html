<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The Pillow Book is a Peter Greenaway (DROWNING BY NUMBERS, THE COOK, THE
THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER, PROSPERO'S BOOKS) mesmerizing visual
experience that touches base with spiritual and erotic themes, but only
wets one's appetite, as its story fails to fully enhance the seductive
nature of what is seen.</P>
<P>Of all things made into a film, calligraphy is one subject that few
movies have used as their subject, but Greenaway, true to his reputation
as a filmmaker with an outrageous streak in him to live up to, continues
to make outlandish films that have a certain perversity to them, as well
as show an elegance in clever filmmaking. Here, he starts off filming in
black and white the childhood experiences of Nagiko (Wu), who
wonderously listens to the stories being read by her aunt (Yoshida) from
a 1,000- year text, based on the work of Sei Shonagon, a courtesan,
whose spellbinding journal of sayings on the subjects of the flesh and
literature makes up "The Pillow Book." The idea of that book, that the
texts of those two subjects (sex & art) should fuse together as one,
with there being no difference between literature and what is beautiful
in their union. Pillow Book is an individual's diary of observations and
a presentment of an interesting list of things the diarist has jotted
down, such as duck eggs and a silver bowl filled with shaved ice.</P>
<P>Nagiko's father (Ogata), whom she idolizes, is a master calligrapher,
who paints her face with characters to celebrate her birthdays, and
tells her: "If God approved of his creation, he will bring the clay
model he created to life by signing his name to it." This seems to
tickle the little girl's fancy, so much so that when we next see her as
a young woman in technicolor, we realize that she has developed a fetish
for having her skin written on, equating her lovers with how good a
calligrapher they are.</P>
<P>After marrying in a traditional Japanese ceremony, to someone she knows
cannot please her, but is forced on her through an arranged marriage by
her father's publisher (Yoshi Oida), she will leave this husband whom
she cannot relate with and move to Hong Kong. Once there she will take
odd jobs, until becoming a fashion model and then a writer on flesh. She
will not communicate with her father from abroad after witnessing her
father's boss, the publisher, force her father to have anal sex with
him, which he does in order to have his books published.</P>
<P>The film concentrates on Nagiko having her lovers write over her nude
body, but she is becoming increasingly frustrated in finding the lover
who is the perfect combination of lover and calligrapher. She will meet
a young English translator she falls for even though she considers him a
scribbler, Jerome (Ewan), a part he plays with appealing relish. To
solve her dilemma of being with someone who is not a calligrapher, she
writes on Jerome's skin after he offers her his body.</P>
<P>Jerome crushes her spirit by having a bisexual relationship with the
same publisher who destroyed her husband financially, blackmailed her
father, and now has soiled the one she loves. She thought that she could
use him to get vengeance on the publisher, but when he goes naked before
the publisher, who reads The Book of a Lover that she wrote on him, her
jealousy and rage gets the better of her and she spurns Jerome.</P>
<P>The plot turns surprising simple, as revenge becomes the motive for
Nagiko, and this offbeat film will remain interesting mostly through its
striking visualizations.</P>
<P>The stunning visualizations range from ones of comedy to ones of
sensuality to ones of gross cruely. An example of comedy, would be in
The Third Book of Impotence, where she has the male she has written her
book on running naked through the crowded streets of Hong Kong. By
writing her own pillow book, that will include thirteen editions, she
will tell her own story. The last one is called The Book of the Dead,
and is an example of how pitiless her retribution can be. Her sensuality
is seen in most of the books she writes, but seems special when she is
with Jerome, as frontal nudity is there, to be examined from all
different angles by a technically efficient camera, that handles these
nude scenes as casually as if the actors were fully dressed.</P>
<P>The fun in the film is in the silliness of the story's subject matter as
juxtaposed against the solemnity of the books being written on skin,
with either somber religious chants or the same pop tune being played
over and over in the background. The repeating of the childhood story,
the constant flashbacks to Nagiko's childhood, where she is repeatedly
told that the diary being read to her is by a woman who has the same
name she has, give the film a stylish depth and a feeling that something
overwhelming is happening.</P>
<P>Greenaway has the knack of telling a seductive tale by utilizing
Nagiko's predilection to flesh out her character. She is really the only
one in the film that we see developing and the only one whom we come to
understand what she is trying to do. Her seventh book, The Book of a
Seducer, was very similar to a Confucius book, where she writes on a
man's bald head, "an itch to read, a scratch to understand." Her ninth,
The Book of Secrets, she has her words written on a man's tongue. There
seems to be a determined effort to be witty, even if the humor is not
scaled to what the story is saying.</P>
<P>The result of this work is a film that is startling to behold, with
gorgeous photogenic shots, superimpositions, amazing computer graphics,
a splash of intriguing gold and red color patterns, with everything
ending up so perverse and lost in an intimacy that seems so melodramatic
that even the scenes that do mean something to the characters still seem
to be too absurd to really mean much. But the film did have plenty of
fire to it, hatred, passion, jealousy, and mystery. I just didn't find
that the story was that emotionally engaging to win me over completely
to what I was seeing, even if I found the film had much to show for its
effort. But for those who like to see the unusual and something that is
artistic, this film is both unique and unforgettable: it's pure
Greenaway.</P>
