<PRE>                               MIAMI RHAPSODY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Sarah Jessica Parker, Antonio Banderas, Mia Farrow, Paul
Mazursky, Gil Bellows, Kevin Pollak, Carla Gugino.
Screenplay/Director:  David Frankel.</P>
<P>     The line between homage and cinematic plagiarism can be a
fairly fine one, and largely a matter of perception.  Then there are
directors who quote so frequently and so freely from their idols
that it becomes an exercise in supreme critical generosity not to
say that the sincerest form of flattery has become a faded photocopy
of a great work of art.  This week's winner of the Brian DePalma
Memorial Award for Stylistic Cannibalism is David Frankel, whose
MIAMI RHAPSODY, though frequently amusing, is such a blatant and
second-rate ersatz Woody Allen film that it might as well have been
called MIAMI HALL.</P>
<P>     MIAMI RHAPSODY stars Sarah Jessica Parker as Gwyn Marcus, a
clever but anxious writer for an ad agency.  After a two year
relationship she has finally become engaged to boyfriend Matt (Gil
Bellows), but Gwyn seems unsure about marriage.  Her uncertainties
are magnified when she discovers that virtually every member of her
family has been unfaithful.  Her father (Paul Mazursky) has had a
string of affairs; Mom (Mia Farrow) is involved with Grandma's Cuban
nurse Antonio (Antonio Banderas); brother Jordan (Kevin Pollak) is
cheating on his pregnant wife (Barbara Garrick).  Even her younger
sister Leslie (Carla Gugino), who has been married for just a few
weeks, is getting some on the side.  All these revelations force
Gwyn to consider whether the compromises necessary in marriage are
worth it all.</P>
<P>     Frankel has crafted a fairly simple story on which to hang his
witty observations about modern marriage, and has created an
interesting character to act as tour guide.  Gwyn is a smart and
funny woman, but an overthinker who uses her cutting remarks to keep
people at a distance.  Sarah Jessica Parker is an extremely
appealing actress, and she is full of energy and sparkle in this
role.  The problems begin when she opens her mouth.  Her character
is so obviously a gender-transferred version of Woody Allen's
compulsively self-analytical intellectual that every word out of her
mouth seems just horribly wrong, or a really misguided impression.
I kept waiting for Parker to put on a pair of horn-rims and be done
with it.</P>
<P>     If only that were the only thing Frankel cribs from Allen.
MIAMI RHAPSODY opens with a jazz score over credits on a black
screen, with cast listings in alphabetical order.  Sound familiar?
It should if you've seen any Woody Allen film in the last fifteen
years.  There are several lines and concepts taken whole cloth from
ANNIE HALL:  a reference to the fact that "love fades;" Gwyn's final
comments on relationships which are remarkably similar to Woody
Allen's "we need the eggs" rationalization at the end of ANNIE HALL;
even an oblique reference to the original title of ANNIE HALL
(ANHEDONIA, or aversion to pleasure) in Gwyn's line, "I'm just
terrified of anything good that might happen to me."  Add to that a
confrontation between Gwyn's father and his mistress which recalls
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, and the mere presence of Mia Farrow.  With
every sardonic quip and every recognizable setup, MIAMI RHAPSODY
began to feel more and more forced and artificial, like some film
school project to cram as many Woody Allen references as possible
into 95 minutes.</P>
<P>     None of this is to say that Frankel doesn't get off his share
of very funny lines, most memorably in a scene at Leslie's wedding
in which she and her husband exchange vows apparently written by Dr.
Seuss.  There are far worse models for making a film than Woody
Allen, and Frankel fires off so many jokes that several of them
invariably hit.  But while Frankel is adept at writing one-liners
for his characters, he doesn't really know how to place them in
interesting or memorable situations.  He also doesn't use his cast
particularly well, leaving Gil Bellows' Matt and Kevin Pollak's
Jordan to drift without a sense of who they are.  MIAMI RHAPSODY is
not without its moments, and I laughed more than a few times.  But
David Frankel is like that guy who quotes all the best lines from
his favorite comedies to his friends.  If I *really* want to laugh,
I'll watch the original.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 would-be Allens:  5.</PRE>
