A Miramax release. 91 minutes. Rated R (language, sexual 
situations, substance use) </P>
<P>The first feature by David O. Russell, the low budget 
"Spanking the Monkey," was daringly original. It made the 
writer-director more than just promising, which is something 
that new filmmakers have to live up to, especially as there is 
generally a kind of curse attached to second features. </P>
<P>In Russell's case, the funny "Flirting With Disaster" is no 
comedown,even though the film is neither daring nor a minor 
landmark.It is clever without brilliance or depth, it is 
inventive without originality.  </P>
<P>"FLT" is a road movie of sorts. Not quite an odyssey as it has 
only three way-stations. Following a zippy montage, we meet 
Mel Coplin (Stiller), about 30, in an adoption agency. 
Entomologist Mel, the beloved and loving adopted son of a New 
York Jewish couple (Moore and Segal), is married to sweet 
Nancy (Arquette). They have a first baby who remains unnamed 
for an outlandish time, partly because Mel is in the throes of 
a pre-midlife crisis. </P>
<P>Has this been brewing for some time or is it sudden? The film, 
not exactly a profound study of characters, tells us nothing. 
We are simply shown a confused Mel who feels that his identity 
will never be complete so long as he does not learn who and 
what his natural parents are.  </P>
<P>Working in an adoption agency, Tina Kalb (Leoni), a beautiful 
long-legged ex-dancer now on the brink of divorce and, 
perhaps, a Ph.D. in psychology, delivers the goods. "Your 
mother lives in San Diego. Let's go." Tina wants to include 
herself and her camcorder as part of her academic research.  </P>
<P>The quartet drives west, is reunited with a caricatural, 
multi-wedded Southern belle. She looks nothing like Mel, is a 
devout Reaganite ("he was a great friend") and the mother of 
gorgeously vacuous beach bimbo twins. Through a mixup in 
Tina's files, the lady turns out to be the wrong person. I 
give away nothing as the audience had guessed this all along. </P>
<P>The episode is amusing, has good farce, almost hilarious 
dialogue and changes of behavior. Contrite Tina, whom Mel is 
attracted to, is now sure she has located the right parents. 
>From the San Diegan sun, the foursome treks to snow and slush, 
Gerald Ford-loving Michigan. The new candidate is an 
improbable father, a low-life type. Diagnosing Mel's "Jew 
nose," he forwards him to New Mexico, but not before a fracas 
that involves a couple (in both senses) of Alcohol, Tobacco & 
Firearms officers. </P>
<P>Paul is gay with some neuroses. Tony is bisexual. As movie 
luck would have it he had gone to school with Nancy, now 
desires her and also feels the need to have a baby. The 
quartet grows to a sextet as the two men, none too credibly, 
go with the Coplins -- as vacationers, not professional 
sleuths.</P>
<P>Episode Three leads to Antelope Springs, N.M. and the real 
McCoys, the Schlictings (Tomlin and Alda) and their sullen, 
weirdo son. This, the journey's decisive leg, turns out to be 
an acid trip for some. </P>
<P>The Schlictings are unreconstructed old acidheads, 
anachronistic hippies who in the Sixties were jailed for 
making LSD. They are are now "artists" who live from their 
awful work, "with supplements from other things." In a film 
that keeps announcing its moves, you can guess that what they 
fabricate in their basement is not Christmas seals. (Major 
laughter is produced when Tina lights up and Alan Alda stops 
her with "This is a non-smoking house.")</P>
<P>There is some lust in the film (Mel and Tina, Tony and Nancy) 
but this pales before the catalogue of references to body 
parts. It begins as Patricia Arquette primps most intimately 
for her husband; then Mary Tyler Moore briefly shows her 
bra-clad breasts (actually nothing risque); it continues with 
legs, calves, noses, male organs, more breasts...</P>
<P>It's rather systematic, as is the movie's development. The 
plumbing of characters is sacrificed to broad gags. You laugh 
allright but the movie's creatures are not really attaching, 
likable or interesting. Eventually they get a bit  tiresome, 
along with the plot's cliched mixups of humans, cars, keys and 
other objects.</P>
<P>Writer-director Russsell is no Preston Sturges or Woody Allen, 
although,  vaguely like Woody, he tries to exploit Jewishness 
vs. Goyishness.  The Coplins (especially Mary Tyler Moore), 
Tina, the two lawmen are more neurotic than dysfunctional, 
while the Schlictings (except the son) are in harmony with 
their kookiness. All actors deliver OK performances in their 
limited-scale roles. </P>
<P>Do not look for ambitious thoughts, not even the old notion 
that the blue bird of happiness is found at home or next door. 
This is first and last a machinery for screwball farce. It's a 
pleasant enough work, with the added bonus of deserving 
inclusion in the BBNMM Society's roster (that's Bring Back the 
Ninety Minute Movie).  </P>
