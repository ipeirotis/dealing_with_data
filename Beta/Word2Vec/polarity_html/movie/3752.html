<P>     An average picture may be worth a thousand words, but the one  
around which A GREAT DAY IN HARLEM was formed is worth many, many more.   
This film tells the story of a legendary jazz photograph -- a shot taken  
in 1958 for ESQUIRE magazine by first-time photographer Art Kane.  It  
looks like a class picture, featuring some "58 guys who have never been  
together in their lives" -- performing legends like Thelonious Monk,  
Dizzy Gillespie, Roy Eldridge, Count Basie, and dozens of others.    </P>
<P>     Jazz fan Jean Bach turned A GREAT DAY OF HARLEM into a labor of  
love.  This motion picture, with its countless anecdotes about elements  
of the photograph and the effort that went into taking it, is a joy to  
watch.  We learn why Thelonious Monk wore a light coat and positioned  
himself next to Marian McPartland and Mary Lou Williams.  We're told  
about Dizzy Gillespie's penchant for sticking his tongue out.  We are  
let in on the truth about why Count Basie was sitting on the curb next  
to a group of children.  Throughout the film's sixty minute running  
time, many of the surviving participants relate fond memories of the day  
and each other.  </P>
<P>     In addition to the interviews, there's plenty of other material to  
make A GREAT DAY IN HARLEM of interest.  First and foremost is the  
score, a compilation of recorded performances by many of the artists  
(both living and dead) featured in the picture.  Then there are  
photographs snapped by others during the gathering.  Milt Hinton's wife,  
Mona, came armed with an 8mm movie camera, and her footage adds color  
and movement.  And, to supplement all this material, Bach has included  
sequences of the performers as they appeared on a 50s TV show, THE SOUND  
OF JAZZ.  </P>
<P>     The picture itself is remarkable -- an amazing feat of good fortune  
that a photographer could gather this many musical luminaries on the  
corner of Lennox Avenue and 125th Street at 10 o'clock in the morning  
(an unreasonably early hour for performers used to going to bed at  
dawn).  In many ways, this film is no less worthy of observation and  
archiving.  In addition to being a wonderful mix of culture, memories,  
and stories, it includes the final filmed interviews with Bud Freeman,  
Buck Clayton, Max Kaminsky, and Dizzy Gillespie -- the man whose last  
on-camera words (which close out the film) send the audience from the  
theater smiling and chuckling.  If there's such a thing as a magical  
documentary, A GREAT DAY IN HARLEM is it.  </P>
