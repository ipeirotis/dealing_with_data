                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Joe Pesci, Christian Slater, Victoria Abril.
Screenplay/Director:  Barry Levinson.</P>
<P>     If there has been one theme one can identify running through the
work of director Barry Levinson, it is the search for the American
Dream.  He brought us the ambitious salesmen of TIN MEN, the optimistic
immigrants of AVALON, and the visionary BUGSY, all darkly-tinged
stories of guys trying to make their mark and make it big.  JIMMY
HOLLYWOOD is another such story, but it is lacking something previous
Levinson projects had, namely a firm grasp on what the protagonsists'
dreams were.  There are interesting ideas in the script, and some of
the dry humor characteristic of Levinson's dialogue, but it's never all
that compelling because the character of Jimmy Alto is too
schizophrenic, and with him the tone of the whole film.</P>
<P>     JIMMY HOLLYWOOD is the nickname of Jimmy Alto (Joe Pesci), a
struggling actor who has gone so far as to buy an advertisement for
himself on a bus stop bench.  He also adores the Hollywood of the
glamorous 1940s and 1950s, and spends afternoons memorizing the stars
on the Walk of Fame with addled friend William (Christian Slater).
That Hollywood is strongly at odds with the reality Jimmy sees around
him, however, and when a couple of crimes hit close to home he decides
to do something about it.  Along with William, Jimmy catches a thief
and turns him in with a note identifying the captors as the "S.O.S."
When the public begins expressing appreciation for the vigilantes,
Jimmy begins to play the role for all it's worth, to the dismay of
long-suffering girlfriend Lorena (Victoria Abril).</P>
<P>     At various times, Levinson appears to be trying to tell two
different stories through Jimmy.  One is about the thankless life of
being a struggling actor, including the cattle calls, waiting tables
and shameless self-promotion necessary to make it.  Jimmy never doubts
for a minute that his big break is just around the corner, and when his
vigilante persona "Jericho" becomes a media sensation, he is unwilling
to give up what he considers "the role of a lifetime."  At the same
time, Levinson paints a picture of a one-time Tinseltown which has
disintegrated into a city of drug deals, homelessness and ATM
muggings.  What happens is that it is never clear what motivates
Jimmy.  One moment it appears that he is a starry-eyed altruist who
wants only to return Hollywood to its former glory; the next, he is
simply a publicity-hungry would-be actor using crime to make a name for
himself.  The Jimmy who wants to strike fear into the hearts of
criminals doesn't gel with the Jimmy who reveals himself for a big
send-off.  It is typical of Levinson to make his heroes' motives less
than completely pure, but in this instance they're simply muddled.  It
is difficult to care all that much about Jimmy, and it's difficult to
figure out whether Levinson wants us to focus on his characters or the
setting.</P>
<P>     It is also a simple truth that JIMMY HOLLYWOOD was a hard film for
me to like.  While it has its humorous moments, it's too grim to be a
purely entertaining comedy, and it doesn't explore its dark themes
deeply enough to be an insightful drama.  Its two principal characters
are frequently more pathetic than they are sympathetic, the pacing is
extremely deliberate, and the shifts in tone had me shifting in my seat
a lot.  When I did find interesting elements, it was more a case of
detatched admiration than enjoyment.</P>
<P>     Among the objects of admiration were two performances, neither of
them Joe Pesci's.  Pesci needs to step back from motor-mouthed New
Yorkers, because they are all beginning to look the same.  His
co-stars, however, are quite good.  Victoria Abril livens up the token
girlfriend role with some strong scenes, particularly a hillside
farewell.  The big surprise is a funny and affecting Christian Slater,
whose forgetful William does the low-key performance in UNTAMED HEART
one better.  Slater is developing into a complete actor, and his
performance here is extremely interesting.  Yet perhaps "interesting"
is the faint praise with which I ultimately damn JIMMY HOLLYWOOD.  I
found a number of things in the film interesting.  I just found none of
them truly engaging.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 cattle calls:  4.</PRE>
