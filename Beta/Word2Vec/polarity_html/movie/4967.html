<PRE>                                  BATMAN
                       A film review by Randy Parker
                        Copyright 1996 Randy Parker</PRE>
<PRE>RATING:  ***1/2  (out of ****)</PRE>
<PRE>(Review written in 1989)</PRE>
<P>        What surprises me most about the long-awaited BATMAN is that the
movie centers not on the Caped Crusader but on the Joker.  The Dark Knight
actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis!  I can hear
Batfans everywhere protesting: "First they had the nerve to cast Michael
Keaton as Batman, and now they think they can get away with making him
second banana to the Joker!!"  And, indeed, this situation would have been
altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that
someone at Warner Brothers had the savvy to cast Jack Nicholson in the role
he was born to play.</P>
<P>        Nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters
and opening credits since his astounding, Oscar-worthy performance as the
Joker is the highlight of BATMAN.  Nicholson shows no inhibition or shame
as he pulls out all the stops to create a Joker that makes Cesar Romero
look like Bozo the Clown (Romero played the Joker in the '60s TV series).
On one hand, Nicholson's Joker is extremely funny.  His murderous escapades
and manic outbursts (which include defacing paintings in an art museum and
invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts) bring
humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film.  But on the other hand, his
outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for
all of mankind.  The Joker's cruelty and demented, diabolical nature are
truly frightening and sinister.  This guy is off his rocker, and he not
only knows it, he flaunts it!</P>
<P>        But enough about Nicholson as the Joker: I'm sure most people are
wondering about Michael Keaton as Batman.  Like many, I was outraged when
Warner Brothers announced that Keaton had been cast as the Caped Crusader.
But Batfans need not worry becauseholy unconventional casting!Keaton
delivers.  He is convincing as the tormented millionaire, Bruce Wayne, and
beneath his hard, black body armor, he is mysterious and formidable as the
Batman.  Even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop
the character, Keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and
emotional rage that drive Wayne to don his Bat gear and battle the low life
scum of Gotham City.</P>
<P>        Visually, BATMAN is a knockoutnothing short of a triumph for
director Tim Burton and his production team.  The movie successfully
captures the film noir look and bleak, gloomy atmosphere of such Batman
comic books as "The Dark Knight Returns" and "The Killing Joke."  Burton's
film is a feast for the eyes; the $35 million budget is definitely on the
screen.  The sets, costumes, and make-up are stunning and worthy of Oscar
nominations.  Nicholson isn't joking when he boasts, "Wait 'till they get a
load of me!"  His grimacing smile, green hair, and purple suits over orange
shirts are colorful and outrageous.  Keaton's wardrobe is equally
appropriate.  Batman's cape, mask, and body armor make him look
threatening, frightening, and invinciblebringing to mind not Adam West's
campy costume in the TV series but Peter Weir's outfit in ROBOCOP.</P>
<P>        Production designer Anton Furst's sets are a wonder.  Gotham City
is dark and foreboding, almost as if it were an expressionist vision of New
York.  The Batcave is cold, bare, and desolate.  The world that Burton and
Furst have created in BATMAN is a melancholy nightmare of violence and
corruption.  The movie's gritty BLADERUNNER/ROBOCOP look is a joy to
behold.</P>
<P>        The plot, on the other hand, is not as rousing.  The screenplay is
not up to snuff in comparison to the  stylized sets and superb acting.  It
takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear.
BATMAN tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology,
but it fails to give us enough of either one.  As I mentioned earlier, the
screenplay gives us plenty of the Joker, but it never fully establishes
Batman's psychological motives and underpinnings.  In terms of action,
BATMAN is not as thrilling as you might expect.  Burton seems more
concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story.  More than
anything, BATMAN is a mood film.</P>
<P>        While BATMAN may not completely absorb and excite you, it will
likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and
spirit of the Batman comic books.  Thanks to its distinctive look, the
movielike a good comic booktransports us to another world.</P>
