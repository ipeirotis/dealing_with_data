<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Holy Smoke is a beautiful film to watch -- from the feverish credit
sequence -- of the film's title written in smoky letters, to Kate
Winslet's psychodelic-like India sojourn, and then onto her trying
experiences in the naturally scenic Australian outback. The film has
perfectly framed scenes and magnificent visuals, and a divertingly
amusing storyline to tune into, even if it gives into its own silly side
and becomes after a fast start mostly a wonderfully entertaining film
touching on many societal nerve points but going nowhere but back into
its own cynical view of life, resorting to a politically safe response
to all its pin pricks about mind control. Though, in all honesty, it
should be commended for taking chances and telling its guru story in
this refreshingly different style.</P>
<P>How perceptive of a film it is, is questionable, as it is provocatively
stimulated by overwrought acting and filled with the Aussie taste for
slapdash comedy and vulgar dialogue. There is too much of a loss of
subject context to do any serious intellectual damage about any of the
themes it broaches. But it does, on the serious side of its agenda, at
least, raise some valid points about mind control and how men treat
women. It is scripted by the Campion sisters (Jane & Anna) and directed
by Jane, with a very noticeable woman's touch and a ribald sense of
lustiness.</P>
<P>It opens with the Australian Ruth Barron (Kate Winslet) in India with
her girlfriend, attending an "enlightenment rally" where a charismatic
Hindu guru, Baba, is performing at. At the gathering, there is a gaudily
resplendent array of yellow and pink colors to dazzle the senses,
seeming more like a light show for a Jefferson Airplane concert at the
Fillmore West than a religious ceremony. Ruth is moved by the experience
and the guru's touch of her forehead is the ultimate one for her, and
she thereby seeks to stay in India and adapt to her new spiritual
consciousness: changing her name to the one given her by Baba, studying
meditation, wearing a sari, and endearing herself to the customs of
India while living in a commune in New Delhi. She is hoping to
straighten out whatever is bothering her about her present life, though
she just came to India as a tourist with no interest in its religions.
But, as the new saying goes, when in India, do what the other tourists
do. So before going back home from her touristy vacation, she visits the
guru and really experiences something magical. I think, later on, when
she is back home, she mentions that she must learn how to cry for others
as being her problem, the thing that she wanted most to learn from her
blissful Hindu guru.</P>
<P>Back home in Australia, her traveling companion girlfriend tells Ruth's
parents that their girl has flipped out and has been brainwashed to join
a cult. The distraught mother (Julie Hamilton) talks her husband (Tim
Robertson) into paying for an expert American cult exiter, someone who
will deprogram her, who comes with the reputation of almost always
succeeding, the only drawback is that he charges a hefty fee for his
services. But first mom has to go to New Delhi to get her daughter to
come back home. She is advised by the local psychologist (Tayshus) to
make up a lie, to tell her daughter that she must come home because her
father is dying, and that once she is home, then the deprogramer will
take over until she is conditioned to go back to being normal again
(which in this case means dressing up in a cowgirl outfit and going to
the local pub for Disco Night, where you can get drunk or high on
drugs). But mom has trouble adjusting to India: its crowds, lack of
modern toilets, and its strange culture. Her collapse comes at just the
right time, as it prevents Ruth's participation in a group wedding to
Baba, and gets her to reluctantly board the plane and come back home to
meet again her calculating, cartoonish, bourgeois family.</P>
<P>When back home in the suburbs of Sydney, the sari wearing Ruth sticks
out from the rest of the middle-class family like a hippie at a
Republican convention. The immediate family consists of her gay brother
(Goddard), her macho brother (Wyllie) with his sexually frustrated
scatter-brained wife (Sophie), and her philandering father and timidly
nervous mother. All of their warmth and smiles for her seem
disingenuous, especially when compared to the guru's.</P>
<P>The deprogrammer, P.J. Waters (Keitel), arrives, dressed in all-black
and sporting snazzy cowboy boots, as if he's a western gunfighter
fighting the Indians-- he stands off to the side in a smug pose, as the
men in the family surround the girl and corral her as if she were an
animal, and force her to meet with the old and weary looking PJ, who has
dyed his hair black and breathes arrogance as easily as a fish makes
bubbles in the water. He also goes heavy on the mouth spray, making sure
he is sweet-smelling at all times.</P>
<P>The two go off to the outback as P. J. puts into motion his 3-day step
program, and the breakdown in the film's sensibility becomes
astronomical at this point, making me wonder what the Campion sisters
were thinking. The film loses its sense of credibility and becomes a
battle of the sexes, with the inevitable male-female struggle taking
precedence over the heavy-handed religious aspects first introduced into
the story. The expert Keitel in a matter of one day loses his grip on
what he has built his whole career on, as he falls in love with Kate,
which seemed far-fetched and unconvincing to me. That is not to say all
these hyperventilating and sexy scenes weren't watchable as mindless
entertainment, as the audience gets a chance to see how really beautiful
Kate's breasts are and how base Keitel could be, as he turns into a
dirty old man and pursues Kate across the outback in a red dress with
smears of lipstick over his face, supposedly getting his just desserts
for being a male chauvenist pig. He is so dishonest, that he gets
quickly sidetracked from his surefire program and means of a rich
livelihood at the first sight of a woman's body and that the family is
so loony that they interrupt his deprogramming, after spending a king's
ransom to secure his services, before he has finished, seemed like a
reach to me, as if the director forgot what her story was about and got
sidetracked into doing a screwball comedy.</P>
<P>Admittedly, it was funny to watch Harvey start to pray to her Baba (God)
for help in making this absurd love affair work, even if Baba can't
help. In reality, praying does not guarantee that one's prays will be
answered. So, in short, he's not for her, and no matter what he does
won't work, which kills the romance part to this screwball comedy.</P>
<P>What does this all mean, not too much, except its fun to see Keitel get
his stereotypical male psyche bruised and ham it up as Kate turns the
tables on him. It was also easy on the eyes to watch the talented
actress that Kate is, walk luringly in the outback night, in a sexually
uninhibited way, and have Keitel eyeball her naked body as she parades
in front of him and to watch as he eagerly makes love to her in the
gentle way a woman wants to be made love to (or deified).</P>
<P>Yes. She has won. He can't deprogram her. But, Ah! those breasts of Kate
are really something to behold...but it is her personality that is the
star of the film. She was the only one in the film who wasn't a shallow
caricature, and her performance was daring, even smashing, taking this
zany script and making the most of it, getting out of it certainly more
than it deserved. Which means the film actually worked in some skewed
sense, as it dove into the question of mind control and the human
condition and gave no answers, except the strong suggestion that having
compassion for another person is what has to emerge from a person's
heart before they can be expected to be free from their karma. And, in a
muddled way, this film lets the audience be the observer and lets it
come to its own conclusions, which is why I imagine this film will get a
mixed-bag of reviews-- ranging from those who can't stand it, to those
who rave about it.</P>
<P>There were so many wasted moments that blunted this beautifully shot
film, that shot itself unecessarily in the foot, even though it did
manage to escape from being a dud by its freaky humor and its nonstop
assault on the senses of propriety, making this a madcap comedy instead
of anything else. It also badly underutilized the talented Pam Grier,
giving her such a miniscule and predictable part, that she had no chance
to do her thing. But what it had going for it, is a sense of freedom, an
eye for beauty, and Kate's undaunting performance, which makes it
something to put in your pipe and smoke. Perhaps not getting the
ultimate high, but definetly not getting down in the dumps.</P>
<P>And speaking about smoke, how easy it is for everything to go up in
smoke, as the film's main ingredient becomes this free moving spirit
that takes charge of the story as it goes off in all sorts of
directions, some worth pursuing (Kate's spiritual trip) and some just
thankfully vanishing as quickly as it came forth (Keitel's ego trip). If
only it wasn't so ridiculous, it could have been a much more salient
film, even if it were to lose a few laughs along the way.</P>
