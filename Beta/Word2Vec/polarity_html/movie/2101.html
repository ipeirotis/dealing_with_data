<P>     Well, either CALENDAR GIRL is a blatant attempt to showcase Jason
Priestley (of BEVERLY HILLS 90210 fame), or it's an undertaking to
make a big-screen copy of the popular 70s sitcom HAPPY DAYS.  One might
naturally assume the former until a look at the credits reveals the
name of Penny Marshall as executive producer--the same Penny Marshall
who played Laverne in the HAPPY DAYS spin-off.</P>
<P>     The story is simple enough: in 1962, three guys just out of high
school (Priestley as Roy, Gabriel Olds as Ned, and Jerry O'Connell as
Scott) decide to drive to California to meet the girl of their
dreams--Marilyn Monroe.  Along the way, they encounter numerous routine
sit-com situations, a lot of bad dialogue, and a few "emotional"
moments that will make you want to retch.  Eventually, of course, they
come face-to-face with Marilyn and learn from her lips the importance
of having friends.</P>
<P>     Not only does this movie seem like HAPPY DAYS, but it has an
unfortunate case of WONDER YEARS-itis, with lengthy voiceovers during
the first and last ten minutes.  If there's something good to be said
about the middle portion of this film, at least we don't have to listen
to Gabriel Olds talking over all the "action".</P>
<P>     Boy, is this a stupid movie.  And I mean really stupid.  Anyone who
foolishly goes to see CALENDAR GIRL will sit in their seats and wonder
whether they're actually seeing what they think they're seeing.  For
those who can't believe how dumb movies can get, this film is ready to
provide a punishing lesson.</P>
<P>     Not only do our erstwhile heroes manage to meet MM, but one of
them gets a date--and subsequently a kiss--from her.  Now, I'm as
willing as the next person to allow a little creative license (or, for
this film, a lot), as long as the result is entertaining.  In this
case, the on-screen idiocy only makes it that much more apparent how
implausible the whole situation is.  Then the movie further shoots
itself in the foot by announcing that Marilyn receives 5000 fan letters
each day.  Why would these three jerks be singled out of all those
others for Marilyn's special attention?</P>
<P>     Of course, MM isn't the dumb blonde she appears to be.  In fact,
she's a veritable wellspring of sagely advice.  Now, I don't pretend to
know what the actress was really like, but I'm pretty sure it's nothing
like the woman of this film, who obviously has all of life's answers.</P>
<P>     Far too much of CALENDAR GIRL is devoted to insipid male bonding,
none of which amounts to anything, and some of which nearly put me to
sleep.  The banter is empty, and the characters even emptier.  There's
a scene in a nudist colony designed to elicit chuckles that garners
grimaces instead.  Ditto for the scene with the cow.  And the
nonsensical subplot with the hoodlums chasing after Roy.  Where do
writers come up with this stuff?</P>
<P>     Based on his performance in this movie, Jason Priestley couldn't
act to save his life.  He delivers dialogue with all the passion of a
dead leaf, and is clearly on hand just to give the ladies in the
audience a hunk to ogle (is there such a thing as a male bimbo?).  To
that end, he obligingly doffs his shirt.  Gabriel Olds, who bears a
remarkable resemblance to a young Ron Howard (there's that HAPPY DAYS
connection again), and Jerry O'Connell won't open any eyes, but at
least they manage an occasionally convincing scene.</P>
<P>     The best parts of this movie are a series of clips from MM
classics like GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES and SOME LIKE IT HOT.  Their
presence is not a reason to see this movie, but they make it apparent
how awful the framing story is.  Glimpses of these movies make
everything around them seem that much more unredeemable.  All-in-all
CALENDAR GIRL fizzles when it should sizzle, and most potential viewers
will find more satisfaction staring at their monthly planner.</P>
