<P>     Bernardo Bertolucci's STEALING BEAUTY opens with a point-of-view
video sequence focusing on the journey of 19-year-old American Lucy Harmon
(Liv Tyler) via plane and train to Tuscany.  As she steps off the train in
Tuscany, Lucy hears a man call to her, and sees a hand bearing a unique
bracelet drop the videotape he had just taken out a window of the train.
A bit of mystery is established:  who is the man in the bracelet, and why
was he following Lucy?  It is a clue to what is wrong with STEALING BEAUTY
that, though the man appears again, his behavior on the train is never
explained, or even addressed.  This is a film of false starts, dead ends
and pointless distractions which pays too little attention to what should
be its central premise.</P>
<P>     Tyler's Lucy is traveling abroad for a couple of very distinct
reasons, we learn.  Returning to the estate of sculptor Ian Grayson (Donal
McCann) and his wife Diana (Sinead Cusack), family friends with whom she
had vacationed five years earlier, virginal Lucy hopes to find the Italian
boy (Roberto Zibetti) who gave her her first kiss, perhaps to share
another first.  She also hopes to find the meaning behind the final entry
in her late mother's diary, which hints at a special connection to the
Graysons' place.  Lucy befriends several other guests at the Graysons',
including terminally ill author Alex Parrish (Jeremy Irons) and Diana's
free-spirited daughter Miranda (Rachel Weisz).</P>
<P>     They are not the only guests at the Grayson residence, which appears
to be a kind of expatriate artist's Hotel Algonquin.  Other regulars
include Noemi (Stefania Sandrelli), an advice-to-the-lovelorn columnist;
Richard (D. W. Moffett), an American entertainment lawyer and Miranda's
lover du jour; and M. Guillaume (Jean Marais), a slightly dotty old poet.
Most of them are given some kind of romantic sub-plot -- just enough, in
fact, to be genuinely annoying.  Bertolucci repeatedly cuts away in the
middle of a scene to an irrelevant tangent, or introduces characters for a
few superfluous moments.  In one scene, an army lieutenant (Leonardo
Treviglio) has his car break down near the Graysons, and ends up joining
them for dinner; in another, Lucy's dance with an older gentleman (Carlo
Cecchi) is interrupted by a drunken, jealous woman who promptly urinates
on the floor.</P>
<P>     All this activity might suggest that Bertolucci simply wants to revel
in the Bohemian lifestyle of the artistic types who populate the Grayson
estate, except that he plays Lucy's quest for her mother's past and the
illness of Irons' Alex so seriously.  It is as though he is afraid that
with all the drinking, dancing and baring of breasts going on, we in the
audience will forget that there are also Serious Issues to be addressed.
The problem is that it is always clear which of Lucy's two missions is of
greater interest to him, to the other characters in the film, and probably
to us.  There's nothing wrong with a simple, erotic coming-of-age story,
but Bertolucci appears to be embarrassed at the thought of making a film
which is about something as base as the loss of virginity.  Consequently,
he piles on the characters and the distracting editing to provide the
illusion of substance, when in fact he is ready to end his story as soon
as Lucy is de-flowered.</P>
<P>     It's truly a shame that Bertolucci was unwilling to focus on that one
story, because it provides a few touching moments.  Liv Tyler, who has
improved exponentially as an actor since her debut in SILENT FALL, is a
radiant presence at the center of the story.  She makes the best of the
sketchy relationship with her poet mother through her own abortive
attempts at verse, and shares some appealing scenes with Irons (in one of
his least mannered recent performances), including one where she reveals
her sexual inexperience.  That revelation finds its way to the other
guests, leading to an effective and poignant sequence in which Lucy, in an
attempt to convince everyone that she finally has a lover, picks up a
drunken young man at a party and makes a point of being seen kissing him
and taking him to her room, where she then watches him pass out in her
bed.  There are moments like that when Lucy is every bit as beguiling as
everyone in STEALING BEAUTY seems convinced that she is, but Bertolucci
still carries on as though he is above it all.  By trying to turn STEALING
BEAUTY into something deep, he muddles it.  He also makes that voyeuristic
opening video sequence all the more telling.  Instead of watching his
character's life unfold, he tries to catch it out of the corner of his
eye, without letting anyone else know that he's looking.</P>
