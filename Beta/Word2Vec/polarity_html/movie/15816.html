PATCH ADAMS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>"It is our mission to ruthlessly train the humanity out of you and make
you something better," Dean Walcott (Bob Gunton) lectures his new
medical students.  "We're going to make doctors out of you."  To those
of you who believe that a medical school dean would actually brag at
orientation that his school's goal is to train the humanity out of its
students, this movie should be dedicated.</P>
<P>Although based on a true story, as the movie reminds us, the preachy and
overlong film stretches credulity at every turn.  Robin Williams, at his
worst as Hunter "Patch" Adams, plays a man who late in life decides to
go to medical school so he can "connect" with people.  Spending his time
making jokes in order to help his desperately sick patients, he never
studies yet manages to make almost the best grades in the entire class.</P>
<P>As directed by Tom Shadyac and written by Steve Oedekerk, who worked
together on the recent remake of THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, the movie should
come complete with two warnings.  First, the FDA should serve notice to
the audience.  Although the agency knows that the ingestion of large
quantities of artificial sweeteners can kill lab rats, the effect on
audiences of such a sickeningly sweet script have not been tested.</P>
<P>Second, parents should be on notice that the film, quite unlike its
happy trailers, is full of death and dying.  We have patients shown in
the final spasms of death, dying before our eyes.  The realism is more
than one might expect from the film's marketing and its PG-13 rating.
Parents, as they did in the foul-mouthed THE NUTTY PROFESSOR by the same
team, may find some of the humor and language questionable for preteens.
Jokes about masturbation and gynecologist's stirrups are just a few of
the movie's questionable inclusions that may surprise parents expecting
lighter fare.</P>
<P>Patch is a philosopher who constantly treats us to his schmaltzy
theories.  The syrupy script feeds him lines that sound more like
readings than conversations.  ("If we want to be a doctor, we must treat
the patient as well as the disease.") The nefarious dean gets the worst
of the cliched lines.  ("Patients don't need to be entertained!
Patients don't need a friend!  They need a doctor!")</P>
<P>The movie, heavy on messages, has as a basic theme that it isn't the
drugs and the operations that will save your life.  What you need is a
feel-good doctor.  And if he doesn't cure you, at least you'll die a
little bit happier.</P>
<P>Putting bedpans on his head and feet, Patch dances around the room to
cheer up a group of desperately ill children.  These bald,
cancer-stricken kids are genuine and cute, the only such characters in
the story.</P>
<P>The movie lets Robin cut up for no reason other than getting some cheap
laughs.  He impersonates a beef producer at a convention.  At the
podium, he shouts "Eat cow!" to the cheering audience of conventioneers.
What -- you may ask -- is this scene doing in this movie?</P>
<P>Robin Williams is a comedic genius but one who is desperate need of a
stronger-willed agent, an agent who will insist Williams avoid films
like PATCH ADAMS and FATHER'S DAY.</P>
<P>The manipulative story ends in a tearjerker followed by the canonical,
big confrontation scene in which Patch takes on the medical
establishment.  Going up against a large board of old fogies who look
like they are conducting the Spanish Inquisition, Patch lectures them
pedantically on the precise meaning of the word "doctor."  Want to place
any bets on the winner?</P>
<P>Movies like PATCH ADAMS need aids to help you through it.  When you have
trouble falling asleep, you count sheep.  In order to stay awake in
PATCH ADAMS, try to count the number of outlandish shirts Patch wears.
It almost seems that he manages to wear more shirts than there are
scenes in the movie.  There may be other survival tricks, but,
hopefully, this one will suffice.</P>
<P>PATCH ADAMS runs too long at 1:55.  It is rated PG-13 for frightening
scenes of death and dying, profanity and crude humor and would be
acceptable for kids over 12.  (We took two 9 year olds expecting a film
more like the trailer.)</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 9, was bored and upset by the film, giving it only *
½.  He liked some of the humor such as the invisible squirrels' scene.
He didn't like the "bad words" and complained that the movie was way too
sad.  His friend Alan, age 9, liked the way the film was "funny and
disgusting" but thought it was too sad.  He generously gave it ***.</P>
