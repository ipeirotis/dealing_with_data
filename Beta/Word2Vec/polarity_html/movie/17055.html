<PRE>The Blob (1988)
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Shawnee Smith; Donovan Leitch; Ricky Paull Goldin; Kevin Dillon &
Billy Beck
The Blob is the remake of the 1960's classic (a term that I use very loosely
to define the original) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out
anything that gets in its way. Now the original version has the virtue of
cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel. The
fact that Steve McQueen was the star of the film doesn't exactly hurt it
either. Fast forward to the late '80's. Steve McQueen isn't in the remake
(this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up
daisies for years). Nor is there any Hollywood heavy hitters in the lead
role. That is unless you count Matt Dillon's brother Kevin as a Hollywood
heavy hitter. The other thing that works against this new Blob is that
special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original. The
only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep
pockets. It looks as if the produces of the new Blob had a couple of holes
in their pockets. The special effects in this movie are cheesy, like the
original's. Unlike the original, they don't look campy, they just look
cheap. One bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is
Shawnee Smith. She is very attractive and can actually act, which is more
than I can say about some of her costars.</P>
<P>In terms of plot, a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky. Seems this
goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite. Anyway, the
pink stuff has a taste for humans. The more people it absorbs, the bigger it
gets. And it isn't the friendliest goop on the block either. Anyway, it
attacks this little town and it's up to the attractive local teenage
population to stop it. Not really, but that is how it seems.</P>
<P>This version attempts to recapture the camp of the original. As I've already
said, this new version of The Blob comes off more as cheap, badly acted, and
badly written than campy. In the years since this film was made none of the
cast have gone on to greatness. Although, star Shawnee Smith had a very tiny
role in Armageddon. The reason that we have never heard of any of them again
is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud. Although some of the film's
smaller roles are filled with some actors that, while not big stars, are
doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in
other movies and TV shows. It also appears that the producers of The Blob
tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the
scenes in which the Blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible.
Sadly, it doesn't work very well.</P>
<P>If you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town, then I would say
that you should skip the remake and rent the original. (Although that isn't
so hot either.) This newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming
qualities.</P>
