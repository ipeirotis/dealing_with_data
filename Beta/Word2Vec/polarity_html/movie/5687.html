<P>     Nihilism does not equal art.  I want to get that point out of the
way, because it appears to be a widely-held belief that critics feel
exactly the opposite.  People note the praise lavished upon films like
NATURAL BORN KILLERS, KIDS and SEVEN and conclude that there is some
conspiracy among the film cognoscenti to force bleakness down the
collective throat of the viewing public.  While I can speak for no critic
but myself (I admired SEVEN, but not NBK or KIDS), I believe that the
common thread is actually daring.  Film-makers dealing with unpleasant
subject matter are almost forced to be inventive to keep the audience
watching.  Others, if they choose, may praise TRAINSPOTTING for its
squalor; I prefer to praise it for the invigorating perspectives of a
writer and a director with ideas and the ability to convey them.</P>
<P>     The ostensible hero of TRAINSPOTTING is Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor),
a young man in Edinburgh who, as his opening monologue announces, has
chosen "not to choose."  Instead, he has chosen to remain perpetually high
on heroin with his friends Spud (Ewen Bremner) and Sick Boy (Jonny Lee
Miller), unemployed and uncaring.  Though he attempts to go straight on
occasion, he always returns to his one and only love, even when
discouraged by non-using friends like Tommy (Kevin McKidd) and Begbie
(Robert Carlyle).  It is only when he is caught shoplifting that Renton is
forced to go cold turkey, and to confront every unpleasant reality of his
life.</P>
<P>     TRAINSPOTTING, a smash hit in Britain, has received a great deal of
comparison to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, both of them tales of amoral youth with
a likeable, philosophically inclined first-person narrator.  It is a
connection director Danny Boyle obviously doesn't discourage, since one
scene is set in a nightclub styled after CLOCKWORK's Korova Milkbar, and
he is going for a similar kind of social criticism.  Though Renton begins
the film with a rant against materialism and suburban values, it is always
clear that his heroin habit has nothing to do with protest.  In one
memorable scene, Spud goes to a job interview required by social services
if he is to remain eligible for unemployment, and he is forced to do his
best to make sure that he doesn't actually get the job.  They are
unapologetic leeches, but Boyle and writer John Hodge (adapting the novel
by Irvine Welsh) also show the hypocrisy of those who criticize Renton,
each with his or her own addiction problem:  Begbie is a drunkard, Tommy
smokes, and Renton's mother takes Valium.  No one is clean; it's all a
question of degree.</P>
<P>     But if there is one thing Boyle does masterfully, it is showing
exactly how brutal this particular degree can be.  The users' relationship
with the drug might be romanticized -- including a scene in which Renton
feels himself sinking into the floor -- there is nothing romanticized
about the effects of heroin addiction.  Boyle's most effective scenes show
users literally wallowing in their own filth:  Renton as he rumages
through a toilet to find the heroin suppositories he just lost, eventually
being swallowed by the bowl; and Spud waking up in a strange bed to find a
rather disgusting mess.  In some of these scenes there is a comic edge,
but Boyle counters them with some absolutely chilling moments, including a
tragedy for which the only response anyone can think of is to get high
again, and a nightmarish detox hallucination by Renton which is guaranteed
to have you squirming.  With a virtuoso's skill, Boyle is able to take
viewers deeply enough into the experience of heroin users that they can
see both the horrible toll the drug takes and the sensation which makes it
all worthwhile to them.</P>
<P>     TRAINSPOTTING's third act, focusing on a heroin deal which interferes
in Renton's attempt to live a straight life, is something of an
unfortunate side trip, as the film loses much of the urgency it had done
such an exceptional job of building.  It does give Robert Carlyle's
hair-trigger psychotic Begbie a showcase, but the whole episode feels like
padding in a much edgier film.  There is one thing that sub-plot does
quite a good job of demonstrating, however, and that is how truly
meaningless drug friends can be to each other; once they're not high, the
lads in TRAINSPOTTING are ready to screw each other over in a moment.  It
also provides a perfect comic coda for Renton's stab at respectability,
because it's clear he doesn't have the moral fiber for it.  That actually
shows what a neat trick Boyle has pulled off:  he has made a moral film
without moralizing, even though it might not look like one on the surface.
Bleak may not always be beautiful, but in TRAINSPOTTING it is necessary to
make the point, a point as sharp as a needle in the arm.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 needles and the damage done:  9.</PRE>
