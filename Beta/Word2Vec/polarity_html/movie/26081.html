<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the British Isles, much
like "Waking Ned Devine," and a host of other popular low budget movies
that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line. It is filled with
likable establishment types living in a quaint town, such as tolerant
vicars and policemen, plenty of eccentrics, and of locals who stick
together through thick and thin. The strength of this film lies in its
rational theme, that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even
less dangerous than drinking alcohol. The film is tolerable until after
its first hour, it then falls completely apart, becoming just too absurd
to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas.</P>
<P>But its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is
on target
and allows the film to, at least, be viewed as containing a pertinent
message. Its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the
'War on Drugs' is about to be escalated into Colombia. The drug war has
been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law
enforcement methods in the future, it has so far just ended up causing
America's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and
offers zero hope of curtailing America's drug usage and drug supply.
Billions of dollars have just been allocated by Congress to get
officially involved in the Colombian Civil War, by backing a corrupt
government (Remember Vietnam!) with the idea that military might could
stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country. Everything
about this proposed action smacks of Vietnam, with this scenario closer
to home, so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result
than the other war.</P>
<P>The film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business
and finding it acceptable by the public, something that should have been
accepted some 40 years ago, is a theme long overdue for public
acceptance, but one that is better received late than never. There has
to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized
and how to educate the public on this, rather than making it a police
matter altogether.</P>
<P>The film opens in a quaint Cornish seaside village at the funeral of the
husband of a middle-aged woman, Grace (Brenda Blethyn), who fell out of
an airplane, evidently committing suicide. The widow soon finds out her
husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined. He left her with a stack
of enormous bills and put up, without her knowledge, their comfortable
300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking
out a second mortgage. The widow finds herself bankrupt and with no
marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent
her from losing the house and becoming homeless. She also knows that he
was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from London, Honey
(Quick). What makes the affair doubly unsatisfying, is that when
conferring with Honey, she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed
but refrained from having sex with her.</P>
<P>Even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they
can, the creditors swoop down on her like vultures. Her gardener and
handyman, Matthew (Ferguson), decides to stay on with her, despite his
last check bouncing. Since she is an expert amateur horticulturist, he
convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants, which he grows for
private use. The two soon see this as a possibly big business
opportunity, as Grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to
be high-quality stuff. For Grace, this is a way to save her house and
get her out of debt; for the Scotsman, Matthew, it offers a chance for
him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money
to marry his fisherman girlfriend Nicky (Valerie).</P>
<P>The locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed: the police
sergeant (Campbell) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in
Grace's greenhouse is for, the friendly vicar (Phillips) counsels about
the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control,
and the doctor (Clunes) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation.</P>
<P>The story becomes incredulous when Grace decides to go to London and
score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having Matthew go, because
she finds out Nicky is pregnant and doesn't want Matthew to end up in
jail. It is interesting to note, that no one thinks smoking grass is bad
for you, only that one can go to jail.</P>
<P>The scene with Grace on Portobello Road in the Notting Hill section of
London, trying to find a drug dealer, while dressed out of place, in a
white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in Cornwall but not on
the streets of Notting Hill while looking to make a drug deal, was
completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole, whereby
it never recovered its dignity.</P>
<P>The film moves into the formula mode, whereas Grace beats the odds
against her failing to survive, as she meets an international drug
dealer, a Frenchman (Tcheky Karyo), who is first seen threatening to cut
off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as
she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about
her experiences, thereby becoming a celebrity. Things work out in a
ridiculous way, where there is a total breakdown in the character
development of Grace, where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely
a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood. There are a lot of
silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting
performance by Brenda Blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to
its belated finale, as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous
upbeat tone, until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old
lady succeeded. This 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that
smoking and growing pot is silly, but should be tolerated as something
naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands
must do in order not to remain destitute. Ummm!</P>
