<P>     During the heyday of his career as a writer, Alexandre Dumas penned 
three novels about a quartet of the best-known characters in European 
literature:  Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan.  In 1844, Dumas 
published THE THREE MUSKETEERS.  The next year, he followed this with 
TWENTY YEARS LATER.  Finally, between 1848 and 1850, his serialized THE 
MAN IN THE IRON MASK came to print.  Like all the best historical 
fiction, this trilogy uses real characters and real events, but imagines 
and re-invents relationships and circumstances.  The resulting 
narratives are complex and entertaining, featuring ample quantities of 
swashbuckling adventure while focusing on well-rounded characters and 
murky politics.</P>
<P>     While THE THREE MUSKETEERS has been adapted more than a dozen times 
for film and television, this new version of THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is 
only the sixth (the last was 1979's THE FIFTH MUSKETEER).  The 
writer/director is Randall Wallace, who scripted BRAVEHEART for Mel 
Gibson.  The problem with this movie is that Wallace has attempted to 
squeeze a 500-page book into a 130-minute motion picture, something that 
can't be done without major sacrifices.  The resulting product is high 
on melodrama and low on the character depth and political machinations 
that are the novel's strengths.  THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is also 
surprisingly devoid of gripping adventure.  Hardly a gun is fired or a 
sword drawn until the climactic half-hour.  </P>
<P>     Although the basic plot follows that of the novel, the central 
characters, older versions of the Four Musketeers, have been simplified 
into generic heroes.  Their motives, as presented in the movie, are 
superficial.  Athos (John Malkovich) has invested all of his hope and 
faith in his son, Raul (Peter Sarsgaard).  Porthos (Gerard Depardieu) is 
enjoying a life of debauched revelry.  Aramis (Jeremy Irons) has become 
the military leader of the Jesuits.  And D'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne) 
remains the devoted captain of the Musketeers.  The story, which 
transpires in 1662 France, blossoms from a rift that grows between the 
older three men and their former protégé.  D'Artagnan's unquestioning 
loyalty to the cold, self-serving king, Louis XIV (Leonardo DiCaprio), 
places him at odds with Porthos, Athos, and Aramis after the king sends 
Athos' son to the front lines of a battle so that he can woo Raul's 
fiancee, Christine (Judith Godreche).  And there is yet another player, 
the mysterious Man in the Iron Mask, who languishes in prison, his face 
hidden from his captors because of his eerie resemblance to King Louis.</P>
<P>     Dramatically, the film is weak, and plays more like a soap opera 
than a screen adaptation of a classic novel.  The costumes and set 
design are impressive, but they're all just window dressing.  The plot 
has the hit-and-miss feel that one might expect from any attempt to cram 
so much material into such a limited running time.  The political 
background, which includes riots by the starving common people, border 
wars, and religious power plays, is given short shrift – a line or two 
here, a quick scene there.  The characters aren't all that interesting, 
since much of their complexity has been stripped away to make them more 
familiar and appealing to today's movie-going crowd.  (For example, the 
Aramis of the book comes close to being a villain, but the Aramis of the 
movie is unquestionably heroic.)  The unfortunate result is that the 
first 90 minutes, which are primarily intended to be dramatic, come 
across as rather dull.  Only in the final half-hour, when we are treated 
to several displays of derring-do, does THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK come 
alive.</P>
<P>     In the wake of his popularity explosion resulting from TITANIC, 
Leonardo DiCaprio will prove to be THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK's chief 
drawing card.  He plays two roles (Louis and the masked man), but fails 
to do either especially well.  The somewhat stilted and occasionally-
ripe dialogue doesn't roll easily off his tongue and, for the most part, 
he gives the impression that he's playing dress-up.  Those who found 
DiCaprio inadequate in ROMEO + JULIET will likely cringe at his work 
here.  Equally ineffective are the two female leads. Judith Godreche, 
who was strong in RIDICULE, is reduced to a lifeless mannequin as Louis' 
mistress, Christine.  And Anne Parillaud, who hasn't been impressive 
since LA FEMME NIKITA, offers a flat interpretation of Queen Anne, 
Louis' widowed mother.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, the veteran actors playing the Musketeers are far 
better, and they have the lion's share of the screen time.  Malkovich is 
as delicious as ever, and it's refreshing to see him in a role where the 
primary characteristic is nobility rather than psychotic behavior.  As 
D'Artagnan, Gabriel Byrne successfully essays a character who is 
increasingly conflicted and uncertain about where his true loyalty lies.  
Gerard Depardieu is delightful as the somewhat-fatuous Porthos.  And, as 
Aramis, Jeremy Irons gives his most lively performance in a long time.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, the negatives in THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK nearly 
counterbalance the positives.  While the last half-hour is exhilarating 
and recalls the best swashbuckling movies, the film takes a little too 
long to get there, and, along the way, is only moderately successful as 
an historical drama or an adventure.  DiCaprio's name will undoubtedly 
give this picture a box-office boost, but his two characters aren't the 
movie's focus – the aging Musketeers are.  And those who are interested 
in learning how their stories end will find greater satisfaction in 
reading Dumas' novel than in sitting through this thin adaptation.</P>
