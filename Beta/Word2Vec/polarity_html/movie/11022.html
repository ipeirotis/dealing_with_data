<P>     In a word, THE BIG LEBOWSKI is a mess.  But what a glorious, 
wonderfully-entertaining mess it is.  This film, the Coen Brothers' 
follow-up to the critically-lauded FARGO, isn't likely to generate the 
same degree of universal praise.  In fact, those expecting something 
along similar lines to the 1997 Oscar nominee may be disappointed.  THE 
BIG LEBOWSKI is an off-the-wall comedy that has more in common with 
RAISING ARIZONA than with FARGO.  Its single weakness, and what amounts 
to little more than a minor distraction, is that it doesn't have much of 
a plot, and what there is contains the kind of gaping holes that even 
the most obtuse viewer can identify.</P>
<P>     Of course, the Coens have never done the same thing twice in a row, 
so it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that THE BIG LEBOWSKI is so 
far afield from FARGO.  Nevertheless, the brothers' inimitable style is 
very much in evidence; if anything, it may be more pronounced here.  
This is one weird motion picture, but I use that term in the kindest 
fashion, because all of the quirkiness adds up to a level of delightful 
humor that few films this side of a MONTY PYTHON enterprise can match.  
This is a comic amusement park ride – a wildly uneven movie that offers 
tremendous pleasure for the moment, even if it doesn't stand up well to 
post-screening analysis and scrutiny.</P>
<P>     The Coens begin by introducing us to their latest protagonist, The 
Dude (Jeff Bridges), a down-and-out, unemployed drifter who is still 
mentally mired in the '60s.  He spends his days moping around his 
apartment, doing nothing and puffing on joints.  On rare occasions, he 
makes his way over to the bowling alley for a league game with his two 
best friends:  Walter (John Goodman), a Polish Catholic Jew who still 
suffers from post-traumatic stress from his days in Vietnam, and Donny 
(Steve Buscemi), a meek moron.  Most of the time, however, The Dude is 
content to stay at home, which is why he's known as "the laziest man in 
Los Angeles County."  That is, until a group of inept crooks confuse him 
with The Big Lebowski (David Huddleston), one of the city's richest 
businessmen.  </P>
<P>     It seems that Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid), The Big Lebowski's 
ornamental wife, owes a great deal of money to porn producer Jackie 
Treehorn (Ben Gazzara).  Treehorn's men mistake The Dude (whose real 
name is also Lebowski) for their quarry – and it takes them a while to 
realize their error (they're not Rhodes scholars).  Irritated that his 
carpet has been ruined by the intruders, The Dude arranges a meeting 
with The Big Lebowski to extract compensation.  But things don't go 
exactly as planned.  Soon, The Dude finds himself on Lebowski's payroll 
as the bag man handling the ransom for his employer's kidnapped wife.  
But the ever-pragmatic Walter thinks The Dude should keep the money.  
Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore), The Big Lebowski's daughter, wants the 
money returned to her family.  Meanwhile, some innocent thief steals The 
Dude's car, where the money is being stored.  And, to top matters off, 
there's some question about whether Bunny is really in any danger.</P>
<P>     Much of the humor comes as a result of the sheer ineptitude of The 
Dude.  This guy isn't a bad choice for handling the ransom drop in a 
kidnapping, he's the worst choice.  He's a complete loser, and his 
friends aren't any better.  Walter is a gun-crazy lunatic who threatens 
to shoot a cheater at the bowling alley, and Donny has a vacuum for a 
brain.  Ultimately, The Dude, Walter, and Donny are the kinds of guys 
who seem at home in a Coen Brothers film, but would be wildly out-of-
place anywhere else (including in the real world).  In addition to these 
three, there are a number of colorful supporting characters, including a 
hilariously over-the-top John Turturro as a bowler named Jesus.  </P>
<P>     When it comes to the bowling alley, the Coens order up more laughs 
in a few scenes than can be found in the whole of KINGPIN (a "bowling 
comedy").  Stepping even deeper into their own surrealistic world of the 
bizarre, the brothers use this arena to stage a parody of Busby Berkley 
musicals.  It's called GUTTERBALLS and it features, among other things, 
a dance number with Julianne Moore in a strange, Viking-like costume, 
Saddam Hussein renting bowling shoes, and Jeff Bridges stuck inside a 
ball, looking out.  </P>
<P>     One of the things I appreciated the most about THE BIG LEBOWSKI is 
its mockery of the voiceover narrative.  Readers of my reviews know that 
this is one of my pet peeves, so it was great fun to watch a film in 
which this approach is openly satirized.  THE BIG LEBOWSKI is narrated 
by Sam Elliot, but, during his self-consciously long-winded opening 
monologue (in which he introduces The Dude), he suddenly loses his train 
of thought, and says as much to the audience.  It's rare that any movie 
uses the narrator to comic effect rather than for unnecessary 
exposition.</P>
<P>     Once again, the Coens have chosen their cast well.  With long hair, 
a beard, sunglasses, and a vapid expression, Jeff Bridges is perfect as 
the perpetually-stoned Dude.  Clean-cut and militant, John Goodman's 
profanity-spewing Walter is delightfully off his rocker.  Steve Buscemi 
for once has a relatively low-key role.  As Maude, Julianne Moore is 
given an opportunity to take a walk on the wild side.  And David 
Huddleston plays Lebowski like Mr. Potter from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, 
wheelchair and all.  </P>
<P>     Problems with the plot notwithstanding, THE BIG LEBOWSKI ranks as 
one of the most audacious comedies of recent years.  The Coens keep the 
jokes coming, although some of them are so subtle they can easily be 
missed (for example, when The Dude writes a check for 69 cents).  
Profane, outrageous, and without inhibitions, THE BIG LEBOWSKI further 
cements the Coens' reputation as independent film makers.</P>
