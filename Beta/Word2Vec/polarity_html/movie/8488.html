<PRE>                               G.I. JANE
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>     What is it with Demi Moore?  One cannot watch her good, but older,
films like GHOST and A FEW GOOD MEN without appreciating her talent.
Her later films, on the other hand, have had scripts that specialize in
the absurd.  Why couldn't she see how hopeless they were?  Was she that
blinded by the size of the salary she was offered?  From THE SCARLET
LETTER to STRIPTEASE to THE JUROR, all have seemed destined to be
disasters.</P>
<P>     Her latest, G.I. JANE, is by the writer of WATERWORLD, David N.
Twohy.  Suffice it to say that it is RAMBO but with pretensions.  Her
character in G.I. JANE is accused once in the movie of trying to be
Joan of Arc.  Indeed Moore plays it like Bruce Willis playing Joan of
Arc -- think DIE HARD 5, but with a message.  The preachy script spends
more energy philosophizing than worrying about the narrative.
Remarkably little happens in the film, but it is so preposterously
presented and takes so long in unfolding that the first hour will seem
like an eternity.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a hazy confirmation hearing for a new
Secretary of the Navy.  As the nominee describes the progress that has
been made getting women into the military, he is interrupted by Texas
Sen. Lillian DeHaven, sitting on a platform high above him.  "Whoa,
whoa, whoa, Mr. Hayes," she chides.  "If a cannibal used a knife and
fork, would you call that progress?"</P>
<P>     Since it's a film about our military, the leaders are shown, of
course, as deceitful and in collusion.  They develop a scheme whereby
women are given the opportunity to qualify for combat positions
believed to be too hard for them and then they can declare women unfit
in general.  Since the toughest outfit is considered to be Navy SEALs,
they let the first woman train for that group.  And when later it looks
like Lt. Jordan O'Neil, played by Moore, might make it as a SEAL, they
develop an even more grandiose conspiracy that includes closing five
bases in Texas -- thus putting thousands of people out of work -- and
concocting false charges against O'Neil.  This cabal will stop at
nothing to prevent a woman from becoming a SEAL.</P>
<P>     The military in this film is one in which instructors physically
abuse their recruits while a hundred people watch and no one complains
or tries to stop it.  Although all of the SEAL candidates are hurt,
none are injured more so than Lt. O'Neil.  She is basically beaten to a
pulp.  Blood streams out of her mouth as she is slugged repeatedly
during some of the milder violence that she has to endure.  G.I. JANE
is a needlessly gory film that is so over-the-top it is hard to decide
what parts of it might be realistic.</P>
<P>     In one scene, a naked Lt. O'Neil is finishing her shower as her
instructor, played with rarely credible evil by Viggo Mortensen,
promotes her on the spot.  In a line so cliched that he must have had
trouble delivering it with a straight face, he says, "Remember, there
are no bad crews, only bad leaders."</P>
<P>     After drifting aimlessly from one outlandish scene to another, the
tedious film's last third takes the asinine plot to new lows and makes
the unbelievable first parts look almost plausible in comparison.
(G.I. JANE manages to be even more ludicrous than THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY
that I saw last week.  At least that film had few pretensions of
realism.)</P>
<P>     And if that is not enough to take, there is the acting, or rather
overacting.  Anne Bancroft, now merely a shadow of her former self,
plays Sen. DeHaven.  Bancroft's heavy southern accent goes in and out
like the tide.  She attempts to play a genteel southern lady of the old
school, but is never convincing even if she does wear flowing dresses,
drink bourbon, and live in dark paneled rooms.  To be fair, the script
gives her some of the worst of the movie's leaden lines.  ("Don't ever
think of playing politics with me, little darlin', or you'll be up way
past your bedtime.")  People in the film don't converse, rather they
engage in political monologues and sermonettes.  Lt. O'Neil's
instructor shouts D. H. Lawrence poetry in the faces of the SEAL
trainees.</P>
<P>     Moore spends most of the film grandstanding while her character
assiduously claims she isn't.  "I'm not here to make some sort of a
statement," Lt. O'Neil informs the base's commanding officer upon her
arrival.  "If you were someone else, you wouldn't be making statements
about making some sort of a statement, would you?" intones the
chauvinistic commander.</P>
<P>     Usually reliable director Ridley Scott does not trust the audience
to understand his points so he overemphasizes them and drills them into
our heads through repetition. He has the military villains frowning and
smoking big smelly cigars.  Scott's uninvolving action sequences are
little more than loud, and he seems obsessed with imbuing the film with
a message with a capital "M."</P>
<P>     Although most of the film can be quite annoying as Scott exploits
an important subject, the picture does have its moments.  Hugh
Johnson's handsome cinematography gives the film an intensity and an
honesty that the script lacks.  His use of a spastic zoom during the
gunfire was a bit much, however.  Cheri Minns's stark make-up for Demi
Moore shows the wear and tear on her face from too much water and too
many beatings.  And finally for those fans of Moore's body, editor
Pietro Scalia's favorite scene transition is another glimpse of Moore
buffing up doing one hand push-ups.  Personally, I would have preferred
acting to sweating.</P>
<P>     G.I. JANE runs overly long at 2:08.  It is rated R for violence
and profanity.  The film would be fine for mature teenagers.  I give
the picture thumbs down and * 1/2 for its unrealized potential.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
