<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Nick (Alessandro Nivola) and Bryce (Josh Brolin) are college friends who
haven't seen each other since their recent college days. When Bryce
arrives in Nick's hometown of Tropico, some place that could be
anywhere, U.S.A.,  he shows him the beautiful ultra-modern posh house
where he is house-sitting rent free, all he has to do is water the
plants. They later on meet in a bar, and while there, an attractive girl
(Reese Witherspoon) comes into the place and the drunken Bryce gets to
know her as Kathy. The next shot is of Nick receiving a frantic call
from Bryce at 2 a.m. that he should hurry over to his place.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival he learns from Bryce that the girl accuses him of date
rape. When she tried to leave, he beat her up, has her gagged and bound
in chains to a pool table downstairs in the recreation room, and finds
while going through her purse that she is underage. He is afraid that he
will be accused of statutory rape, even if it comes out that she was
willing. He laments that his life is ruined, that he will never get
tenure in the college teaching job he just obtained, and that his career
is over. He asks his friend Nick, What should I do?</P>
<P>When Nick is alone with the girl, we learn that this was a setup, that
Kathy is Lissa, they are a couple who planned this to steal a Lincoln
note valued at some $200,000. They do it because Nick is in deep trouble
after he agreed to help some workplace friends out in a setup robbery
that backfired. She does it to help the one she fell in love with. The
film flashes back four months earlier and the viewers are fully apprised
of what led to this situation.</P>
<P>Nick came back to town to take care of his sick father. When his father
died, he shows no remorse and becomes bitterly disappointed that his
father's promised inheritance has been seized by the IRS for back-taxes
owed. Lissa is someone sweet he meets while in a veterinary clinic, who
falls for the good-looking guy and puts her trust in him. Bryce, on the
other hand, is a spoiled rich kid, who has a history of ratting on
friends, and is a constant whiner. The story revolves around these three
uninteresting characters.</P>
<P>The mild attempt, in this B- film, to be a convincing noir film, never
materializes, as the film looks more like a sophomoric attempt to
imitate the genre than the real thing. There is no feeling for
characters or intensity in this story, it looks contrived from the
get-go. All the characters, except for Reese's, are slime balls, people
we could care less about. So when this film moves into its different
plot twists and all kinds of ludicrous situations develop, it wanes in
interest, as the characters were never developed and the film has a
cheesy look to it. It seems to have the style of a thriller but without
the substance.</P>
<P>The phoniest and dumbest scene in the film, was when a violent drug
dealer (Carroll) was seen torturing those who robbed his stash of coke
and explaining it like it was a lesson in economics. Its attempt at
humor alluded me.</P>
