<P>     Life, they say, is all about trade-offs, but RUSH HOUR asks for a
trade-off that just doesn't seem fair:  in order to watch Jackie Chan in
action, you've gotta listen to Chris Tucker in action.  Chan is one of the
most engaging performers in films, a creater of ingenious martial artistry
whose personal charm makes his jaw-dropping stunt work even more fun to
watch.  Tucker, on the other hand, may be the funniest guy on the planet
some day, but I'll never know it until he stops reading every line in the
mellifluous tones usually associated with a circular saw.  Chan is great;
Tucker is grating.</P>
<P>     RUSH HOUR balances the two nearly perfectly, creating a synthesis
that is pure cinematic mediocrity.  The premise, squeezed through the
Play-Doh Fun Factory of buddy-action plotting, casts Tucker as LAPD
Detective James Carter, a loose cannon perpetually aggravating his
straight-laced captain (as though there were any other kind).  When the
kidnapping of a Chinese diplomat's daughter prompts the diplomat to bring
in his old friend, Hong Kong Detective Lee (Chan) to help with the case,
the FBI looks for a sucker -- er, volunteer -- to keep Lee out of the way
of the "real" investigation.  Thus fish-out-of-water Lee ends up cruising
the L.A. underworld as Carter tries to get out of trouble by solving the
case himself; thus more-mouth-than-method Carter needs Lee's fast hands
and feet to save his skin again and again.</P>
<P>     I suspect Tucker might have been thinking of RUSH HOUR as his BEVERLY
HILLS COP, a chance to play the street-wise rebel with a badge in an
action comedy setting.  There's no question that he has his adherents --
the folks in the theater who were howling with glee and stomping their
feet at his every bug-eyed shriek -- but I can't see Tucker crossing over
into the kind of broad popularity enjoyed by Eddie Murphy.  The reason is
quite simple:  where Murphy generally seems amused by the foibles of his
on-screen foils, Tucker seems perpetually irritated.  Every canned insult
he spews makes him that much more unpleasant to spend time with -- not
exactly the vibe you're looking for in a leading man.</P>
<P>     He should take a few lessons from his co-star, who virtually defines
"pleasant to spend time with."  Director Brett Ratner may not have the
visual flair of Chan's frequent collaborator Stanley Tong, but he's smart
enough to get out of the way and let Chan do his thing (some sloppy
editing choices notwithstanding).  A Jackie Chan fight sequence still has
the ability to dazzle the way no other fight sequence can, mixing silly
bits of business with lighting-fast choreography.  RUSH HOUR is nothing
but fun when it's nothing but a showcase for Chan, whether he's fighting
bad guys while trying to protect a priceless piece of Chinese pottery from
harm, or scaling walls and trees in a manner more feline than human.</P>
<P>     On paper, the collaboration between Chan and Tucker probably looked
like an ideal match of opposites -- one the self-deprecating physical
comedian, the other the self-aggrandizing verbal comedian.  Their styles,
unfortunately, collide where they should commingle.  RUSH HOUR is less a
Jackie Chan/Chris Tucker film than it is a Jackie Chan film alternating
with a Chris Tucker film, each performer taking turns yanking the
predictable material into his preferred comfort zone.  If you're a fan of
both lead actors, you'll probably get the double-barreled rush the makers
of RUSH HOUR were aiming for.  If you're like me, you'll find it misfiring
as often as it hits its target.  Only when Chan was in the spotlight could
I ignore the mundane plot points, including an absurdly obviousl
"revelation" of the villain's identity and an oh-by-the-way sub-plot
involving an inexperienced bomb squad cop (Elizabeth Pena).  Only then
could I safely and happily suspend my disbelief.  Only then could I forget
what I had been forced to endure from the other half of the star tandem.
Trade-offs can be so cruel.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 dry rushes:  5.</PRE>
