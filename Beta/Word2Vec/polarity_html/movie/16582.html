<P>Since 1990, the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of
style. Now, instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with
characters of noble virtues, the screenplays and direction point toward
human struggle and sorrow. This realist tendancy can be inspiring at
times, as 1993's SCHINDLER'S LIST shows. Most of today's mainstream
drama, however, creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off
members of the audience. That's why pictures like OCTOBER SKY, which are
a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear, are such a welcome
relief in contemporary cinema. </P>
<P>The movie is based on the true story of Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal),
a teenager in the 1950's company town of Coalwood, West Virginia. It's a
well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the
ones that get out of the town on football scholarships; the rest grow up
to work in the coal mine. The mine, which is run by Homer's father
(Chris Cooper), is not the place for Homer, however. After watching the
Soviet satellite Sputnik shoot across the October sky in 1957, Homer
feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it, "Anyone in
the world could look up and see the same thing I did." Drafting two of
his best friends and the brainiac outcast, Homer begins to construct
rockets. With the help of their history teacher, Miss Riley (Laura
Dern), and several mine workers, the four are soon bound for great
things. </P>
<P>October Sky is a skillfully crafted film, and most of that credit must
go to director Joe Johnston. Johnston -- whose career in the film
industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like
JUMANJI and THE ROCKETEER down to an uncredited role as a Death Star
trooper in STAR WARS -- certainly knows what he's doing here. He molds
characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that
is straightforward and robust. He does not push any barriers, but
instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the
film's charm. His finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be
lost -- such as the relationships between Homer and various mine
workers, or the silent struggle between Homer's mother and father. </P>
<P>The cast is well chosen, although the true bright spots are the
supporting roles. Laura Dern (JURASSIC PARK) lends a strong performance
in the role of the history teacher, giving the boys the support and
guidance they need. Her role is instantly likeable. Chris Cooper (THE
HORSE WHISPERER), as Homer's father, is less likeable -- even downright
despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie.
He's definitely a driving force in Homer's life, and his more humane
moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable. </P>
<P>The script is generally cheerful, projecting the boys' endeavors in a
lighthearted manner. There are moments when it becomes predictable --
such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it
sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot
twist. It highlights the essence of youth, however, and for its
exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps. </P>
<P>OCTOBER SKY should be a success with audiences. Although it doesn't have
the appeal of current teen flicks like VARSITY BLUES or SHE'S ALL THAT,
it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean
towards. It's a welcome change to the dramatic genre, and one that
everyone should see. </P>
