<P>     A missing cufflink.  A misplaced watch.  A lost set of keys.  In 
general, we attribute these absences to a faulty memory, but could there 
be another explanation?  What if there are little people, half 
Lilliputian and half leprechaun, who delight in filching such items out 
from under our noses?  They live under the floorboards of our houses, 
and only emerge when the coast is clear to do their "borrowing," then 
are gone before any human can see them.  That's the premise of THE 
BORROWERS, a new family film from director Peter Hewitt based on the 
series of children's books by Mary Norton.</P>
<P>     Loosely speaking, THE BORROWERS belongs to the HOME ALONE genre 
(clever, little underdogs defeat big, bulky bad guys while inflicting 
enormous physical discomfort upon the villains), which might be 
something of a surprise to those who hold the Norton books in high 
esteem.  This movie comes across very much like the aforementioned HOME 
ALONE meets GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, and bears more than a passing 
resemblance to last year's MOUSEHUNT, which was also about something 
hiding behind the walls and under the floors (although there it was a 
mouse; here, it's tiny people).</P>
<P>     THE BORROWERS presents its tale from two perspectives:  that of the 
normal-sized humans and that of the 4-inch high borrowers.  The fact 
that there's solid characterizations on both ends of the size spectrum 
is what makes this film more successful than many features with similar 
skeletal plotlines.  In THE BORROWERS, the viewer isn't forced to 
identify with an animatronic rodent or an irritating child actor.  
Instead, the film makers offer Pod Clock (Jim Broadbent); his wife, 
Homily (Celia Imire); and their children, teenager Arrietty (Flora 
Newbigin), and nine-year old Peagreen (Tom Felton).  All four, despite 
their diminutive size, are solidly-developed and likable.  Meanwhile, on 
the larger scale, there's Pete Lender (Bradley Pierce), the human boy 
who befriends the borrower family.  The villain is the nefarious Ocious 
P. Potter (John Goodman).</P>
<P>     The story goes something like this:  Pete's family is being forced 
to move out of their house because the unscrupulous Potter has stolen 
the will that leaves the property to them.  The house is to be torn down 
to make way for apartment buildings (the first dwellings in a proposed 
development called "Pottersville" -- I wonder if someone saw IT'S A 
WONDERFUL LIFE?), so Pete, who recently discovered that a family of 
borrowers live under the floorboards, informs his new friends that they 
have to depart.  However, in transit to the new house, the borrower 
children become separated from their parents.  Arrietty and Peagreen 
return to the old dwelling in time to learn that Potter has cheated 
Pete's family out of their rightful property.  So the two young 
borrowers set out to rectify matters.</P>
<P>     Much of the violence found in THE BORROWERS is of the live-action 
cartoon variety -- that is to say, it's wildly exaggerated and no one 
really gets hurt.  Overall, it's not as mean-spirited as we've come to 
expect from this sort of movie.  Aside from a massive electrical shock, 
nothing horrible happens to anyone.  No irons fall on people's heads, no 
one tumbles out of a third-story window, and no one gets tarred and 
feathered.  "Tame" might be the best word to describe scenes in which 
the villain is spraypainted in the face, has a needle stuck in his 
posterior, and gets a vat of liquid cheese dumped on his head.  </P>
<P>     In bringing this comedic fantasy-adventure to life, director Peter 
Hewitt (BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY) is ably assisted by a fine troupe 
of actors who hail from both sides of the Atlantic.  John Goodman, who 
seems to be omnipresent these days (this is the third movie in four days 
that I've seen him in -- the other two are BLUES BROTHERS 2000 and THE 
BIG LEBOWSKI), enjoys himself immensely as the larger-than-life Potter, 
who doesn't have a kind bone in his body.  Jim Broadbent, the fine 
British thespian, brings life and character to Pod.  Newcomer Flora 
Newbigin is incandescent as Arrietty.  Amusing supporting roles are 
filled by Mark Williams (as Potter's henchman, Jeff, the "Pest Control 
Operative") and Hugh Laurie (as an ultra-helpful policeman).</P>
<P>     One of the nicest surprises about THE BORROWERS is that it's not 
only charming, but genuinely funny.  Granted, there aren't many belly 
laughs, but the screenplay offers plenty of opportunities for smiles and 
chuckles, and there's nothing here that kids need to be shielded from.  
Likewise, THE BORROWERS stays at a high enough level to involve adults.  
Aside from the solid cast and the entertaining script, the movie also 
boasts an impressive look.  The city where THE BORROWERS takes place 
resembles a generic 1950s American metropolis with a slightly gothic 
appearance -- sort of a lighter version of BATMAN's Gotham City.  From 
time-to-time, some offbeat bit of humor coupled with the creative set 
design generates a distant echo of Terry Gilliam's brilliant BRAZIL.  
Best of all, however, is that THE BORROWERS doesn't limit its capacity 
for pleasure to any particular age group.  It's the most delightful 
family film thus far in 1998.</P>
