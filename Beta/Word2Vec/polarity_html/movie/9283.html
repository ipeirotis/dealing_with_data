<P>     There was a time during the long history of the adult entertainment 
industry that porn films showed signs of artistic ambition.  During the 
late '70s, a small cadre of directors believed that they could combine 
the raunch of real sex with an involving plot.  It was a lofty goal, and 
one that ultimately proved impossible to realize, especially with the 
advent of video forcing movies to be made cheaper and faster.  In his 
new film, BOOGIE NIGHTS, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson takes us 
back to the disco era, and, by following a small group of characters, 
recreates the rise and fall of "artistic porn" and those who 
participated in it.</P>
<P>     But BOOGIE NIGHTS isn't just an expose of the porn industry -- it's 
a provocative and involving character study, as well.  While it could be 
argued that Anderson has bitten off more than he can chew -- a few too 
many of the men and women populating his film are left half-developed -- 
an overambitious approach is always preferable to the alternative, and 
BOOGIE NIGHTS does enough things right that it's easy to overlook its 
few shortcomings.</P>
<P>     One of the movie's greatest, and most immediately obvious, assets 
is its ability to capture the feel and mood of the late '70s and early 
'80s.  At different times throughout the film, Anderson uses long, 
single takes where the camera pans from one character to another, 
putting the viewer in the midst of a swirl of activity.  The director 
also has a talent for picking just the right songs for each scene, 
making the soundtrack an integral part of the movie rather than just a 
jumbled collection of old disco hits.  Add to that the hairdos, 
clothing, decor, and attitudes of the era, and you have an effective re-
creation of recent history.  And, unlike THE ICE STORM, which transpires 
in '70s suburbia, BOOGIE NIGHTS is set in the sleazy heart of Los 
Angeles' drug-and-sex industry. </P>
<P>     Anderson also does a wonderful job of delineating the differences 
between the late '70s and the early '80s.  The first half of the film, 
which takes place between 1977 and late 1979, is lively and energetic, 
with the focus on parties and good times.  Then, following a pivotal 
sequence at a 1979/80 New Year's Eve gathering, BOOGIE NIGHTS' tone 
shifts to something more grim and contentious.  The porn industry goes 
into a downward spiral with mass-market video supplanting carefully-made 
movies, and the actors and directors are sucked down with it.  Drugs and 
death run rampant.  No one dies during the movie's first half (although 
there is a drug overdose), but the final hour features a body count.</P>
<P>     At BOOGIE NIGHTS' center is Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a waiter 
at a San Fernando Valley night club who is "discovered" by idealistic 
porn movie producer/director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds).  Jack's dream 
is to make a movie that is "true, and right, and dramatic," and his 
vision excites Eddie, who changes his name to Dirk Diggler and quickly 
becomes the hottest young stud in the industry.  Together, the director 
and his star seek to elevate the Adult Film to the next level (which 
actually resembles a cheap exploitation action flick).</P>
<P>     Dirk isn't the only one under Jack's wing.  His home has become the 
gathering place for all sorts of damaged souls working in the business.  
There's Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a top female star who has lost 
custody of her son because of her involvement with Jack.  Rollergirl 
(Heather Graham) is an airheaded young starlet who drops out of high 
school to be in the movies.  Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) is one of Jack's 
veterans, but his dream is to have a wife, a family, and his own hi-fi 
equipment store.  Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) is a hanger-on who 
becomes close friends with Dirk.  And Little Bill (William H. Macy) is a 
behind-the-scenes worker who never feels comfortable with the kind of 
movies that he's involved in.  His resolution to this dilemma leads to 
BOOGIE NIGHTS' change of direction.</P>
<P>     Although Mark Wahlberg has the starring role, and gives the best 
performance of his still-young career (although there are still times 
when he is stiff), he is easily overshadowed by two more impressive 
portrayals.  Burt Reynolds, doing his best motion picture work in recent 
memory, develops Jack into a three-dimensional individual who really 
believes in his job until disillusionment hits.  Matching Reynolds' 
performance step-by-step is Julianne Moore, who can add her role in 
BOOGIE NIGHTS to an ever-increasing list of interesting and challenging 
characters.  Meanwhile, Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, and William H. Macy 
are impressive in smaller parts (all of them deserve more screen time).  
And porn icon Nina Hartley gets some mainstream exposure, and even a few 
lines, as Little Bill's wife.</P>
<P>     BOOGIE NIGHTS is filled with so many subplots and secondary themes 
that it would be impossible to recount them all here.  Some of the most 
obvious involve the allure of stardom and the price certain individuals 
are willing to pay to attain it, the difficulty of "rehabilitating" 
one's name after being associated with something as "damaging" as the 
porn industry, and the inner need to belong.  All of the men and women 
populating BOOGIE NIGHTS encounter at least one of these elements as 
they traverse their character arc.</P>
<P>     With BOOGIE NIGHTS, Anderson has realized the potential he showed 
in his previous feature, HARD 8 (which featured John C. Reilly and 
Philip Baker Hall, two members of this movie's ensemble cast).  BOOGIE 
NIGHTS is a dramatically rich and visually arresting motion picture that 
has earned (and is deserving of) comparisons to the films of Robert 
Altman.  Anderson takes risks with this movie, few of which fall short.  
(One of these is the pointed and sure-to-be controversial final shot -- 
a perfectly conceived and framed statement about the de-humanizing 
effects of the porn industry.)  The result is a memorably penetrating 
motion picture.</P>
