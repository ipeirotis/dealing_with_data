<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Set in the Los Angeles of the late 1960s, this is Antonioni's only foray
turned into an American film. He becomes the foreign outsider who
focuses his sights on the radical protests taking place at that time on
the college campuses. His rambling story is a near-masterpiece of vision
and great perception of what was taking place, as it let go of plot
development and storyline, and instead captured the moods, atmosphere,
and insights making up the changing landscape in America's unprecedented
time of political unrest and social change, as the mostly white
middle-class student joined with the black militants demanding that the
system change.</P>
<P>Mark Frechette is college drop-out, now operating a fork-lift truck for
a living, who still rooms with his radical college mates. He is bored
with the rhetoric from his white middle-class protestors, who are seen
with black militants at a joint meeting, as they are being chastised and
lectured to by them, told to expect violence from the police as they are
leading a demonstration against their local college. Kathleen Cleaver,
seen as she is with her recognizable Afro and militant dialogue,
basically plays herself, telling the white students that blacks are
always ready for revolution because they have been suppressed for so
long.</P>
<P>Out of boredom, wanting to do something revolutionary, Mark gets ready
for the college protests by purchasing a gun from a gunshop, forgoing
the usual waiting period required by the state by telling the gun seller
he lives in a borderline neighborhood and needs the gun for protection.</P>
<P>As the tensions run high in the city over the protests, the media is
mainly looking for the sensational story and not interested in telling
the student's side, and the police are shown as being hostile to the
demonstrators. Mark watches as the police tear gas the college
administration building and he uses the opportunity to probably shoot a
cop (if I was asked to be a witness, I couldn't tell for sure if he
actually was the one who killed the cop). Anyway, he is told by his
roommates that his friends identified him as the shooter by watching the
TV news.</P>
<P>On-the-run, Mark decides to take a small plane and he goes aimlessly
over Death Valley, where he spots a car on the deserted road driven by a
very attractive hippie, Daria Halprin. She is the lover and secretary
for Lee Allen (Rod), a big real-estate developer, who runs a firm that
is exploiting the desert for their developments. He is so taken with her
whimsical nature and beauty that he will leave the bargaining table in
the middle of a 40 million dollar deal, just to speak casually with her
on the phone.</P>
<P>When Mark's plane runs out of gas, she agrees to give him a lift to the
next gas station, but they stop off at a deserted tourist place called
Zabriskie Point, an area of ancient lake beds. Here they flirt with each
other, get to know something about the other and frolic in the sand
dunes, making love as the camera also shows some other imaginary couples
making love.</P>
<P>She is into smoking grass, listening to rock music, and staying away
from the heaviness of reality, instead she survives by using her
imagination. He is a realist, not even willing to smoke grass, but
stating that he believes that violence is needed to let others know who
the enemy is and then they will be able to get rid of them. She asks,
then what do you do, count up who killed more enemies and the winner
gets the last shot!</P>
<P>Mark decides his joy ride is over and will take the plane back to L.A.
after gassing up and painting the plane in absurd colors, a childish
protest against the rich, even writing on the plane's side, "Suck
Bucks." Daria tells him to just leave the plane here and she'll drive
him back to Phoenix, but he says he likes risks and feels responsible to
take it back.</P>
<P>Once landing it in the airport he stole it from, the police surround him
and unnecessarily shoot him. When Daria hears this on the radio, she is
visibly shook up, as she enters the bourgeois dream-house of her boss's
firm, with all the luxuries and amenities, including an ornate pool. She
decides that she can't stay here anymore and sneaks away from her
capitalist pig lover, all-the-time picturing the luxury ranch house
being blown to bits, with all the consumer products in it, such as
refrigerators, TV's, air-conditioners, being blown-up. It is all in her
head, and she rides away from there with a smile on her face. The
explosions take place in slow-motion and Pink Floyd's "Careful with That
Axe, Eugene" plays as the products of commercialization go floating by.</P>
<P>Antonioni wanted to make a film that visually shows that it is a change
of attitude inside your head that changes the system and not violence.
That if you can't change yourself and are still caught in the
consumerism trap, you can't change the way society is driven, you will
only change the surface of things. Reality is inside your head. It is
not by killing off your enemies that you accomplish your aims, but by
getting your act together so that you are not part of the problem. It is
up to you to make the world a better place to live.</P>
<P>There was one other particular scene that got my attention, when Daria
arrives in an Arizona desert town that she doesn't even know the name
of, a real nobody place, coming there to meet a friend of hers from L.A.
who told her it is a great place for meditation. But when inside the
local cafe and bar, the group of emotionally disturbed kids her friend
brought here from L.A. are seen running around unsupervised and they
break the bar window. When she confronts them, they pinch her ass, while
her great meditator friend is nowhere to be found. She promptly takes
off, as Antonioni is sending a message that if you think you can escape
from the world and your responsibilities by retreating from it, you are
mistaken, you only make matters worst.</P>
<P>The film originally garnered bad reviews in general and ended up being a
commercial failure, subjecting the director to some unfairly harsh
criticism. But it was probably the most perceptive film made about that
turbulent time, and it is not outdated like most of the critically
praised films of that particular genre are when viewed today.</P>
<P>The nonprofessional actor stars lived in a Boston commune together, then
Daria briefly got married to Dennis Hopper. Mark went to prison for
robbing a bank, which he says was for political reasons. He died in a
1975 prison accident.</P>
