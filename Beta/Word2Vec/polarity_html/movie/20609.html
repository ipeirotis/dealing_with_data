<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>I felt like I was being one-lined to a loving death in this elegant
Oscar Wilde comedy/drama costume play turned movie, and I must confess,
I enjoyed every bit of the intelligence and the wit and the frivality of
it, as this tremendous ensemble cast fired away with a continuous volley
of epigrams. It is a modern play, even though it is one that was written
in the last century for an audience that was more or less reflective of
the characters portrayed on stage. For the elite audience that attended
the play, Oscar Wilde, after mocking the English nobility would, at
least, leave them with a thinly disguised compliment, by telling them no
one can be ideal. The film was put to screen by the manipulative
wizardry of Miramax (Shakespeare in Love, The Wings of the Dove), who
know from the success of some of their recent films quite well how to
popularize an already popular literary work by broadening its emotional
appeal. They gave the audiences what they wanted, a film that has a
romantic heart in it and is not just hilariously flippant, and they
should be commended for improving an imperfect but successful play. It
rarely happens when a commercial venture turns out to critically improve
a work of so called "art," so when it does happen, it should be shouted
from the highest mountain peaks.</P>
<P>Even before the film grandly opens at the party of the ideal husband Sir
Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam) and his loving Victorian wife, the
beautiful and the suffragette-minded Lady Gertrude Chiltern (Cate
Blanchett), we will meet all the main players and be introduced to some
of their mannerisms. Then we tune into the real hero of the movie, the
one whom I found it easiest to relate to, the slothful and cynical true
voice of Oscar Wilde for the film, the rakish Lord Goring (Rupert
Everett), who tells his loyal servant Phipps (Peter Vaughan) "To love
oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance." And while he is being
delivered his morning paper, a naked woman is in his bed. He will then
read aloud an item in the paper about the upcoming party, followed by
the title on screen "1895--The London Season, where people are looking
for husbands...or hiding from them." This now takes us seamlessly into
the park, where the shrewd Mrs. Laura Cheveley (Julianne Moore) is in a
carriage with the haughty Lady Markby (Lindsay Duncan) as they come upon
Gertrude, and we immediately see that there is some friction between
Laura and Gertrude, and that Lady Markby feels proud that she can
arrange for her visiting friend from Vienna to be invited to the party
she so badly wanted to attend.</P>
<P>Immediately, at the party, the idyllic love bubble of the Chilterns is
burst by the treacherous Mrs. Cheveley (the former lover of Lord
Goring), who meets with the righteously honest politician on the rise,
Sir Robert, in order to blackmail him into supporting an Argentinean
canal scheme she has invested a great deal of her money in. Sir Robert
has already said in Parliament that he regards that scheme as a
"swindle." She  threatens to reveal a letter he wrote her 18 years ago
that gave inside info on the Suez Canal to an Austrian baron before the
government announced its intentions. Sir Robert, if he doesn't change
his opinion, risks losing his wife if the letter is given to the press
and risks losing his credibility with the public if he supports the
canal. His best friend, Lord Goring, acts as the liaison, trying to
prevent the Chilterns from breaking up. He is also having an innocently
romantic relationship with Sir Robert's sister, Lady Mabel (Minnie
Driver).</P>
<P>Everything is thoroughly enjoyable and agreeable about this wonderfully
delightful work of subtle wit and brilliant dialogue. Rupert Everett
stands out as a sheer delight in a cast that is almost perfect (Julianne
Moore could have been a tad more sinister). Everett's role is one that
he relishes in, as he says of himself, "I love talking about nothing,
it's the only thing I know anything about." Minnie Driver is simply
bubbling over with charm and wit to match his. Their flirtations are one
of dueling wits, with amusing lunges and enough double-entendres to get
through any intellectual armor worn.  It is film laced with political
blackmail, an incriminating letter, mix-up in identities, questions
about friendship and loyalty, money as a means to an end, sex as a
weapon for marriage, the machinations of politics scorned at, a
potential tabloid scandal in the horizon and sanctimonious characters
fighting to avoid being toppled. Even the minor players were perfectly
cast, magnified by the performance of John Wood as Earl of Caversham,
Lord Goring's stuffy father, who is always lecturing him and trying to
get him married.</P>
<P>There are so many witty phrases to revel in, but my favorite one is when
Lord Goring says, "Morality is only for those you don't like."
Writer/director Oliver Parker (Othello) has created a lighthearted film
for all audiences who love the spoken word as if it were a treasure and
who find the intrigues of high society to be invigorating.</P>
