<PRE>                                 PHILADELPHIA
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring: Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Jason Robards, Mary
Steenburgen, Antonio Banderas.
Screenplay: Ron Nyswaner.
Director: Jonathan Demme.</P>
<P>     Maybe I've just been lucky, but after living in Northern
California for almost ten years I no longer think of "tolerance" as
merely a buzzword; it's part of the fabric of life.  Consequently, I
couldn't help but feel slightly patronized by the sense of outrage
which provides the backbone of Jonathan Demme's PHILADELPHIA.  The
message was important, but to me, it wasn't news.  When that message is
stripped away to permit examination of the filmmaking, I find as many
examples of what I consider bad decisions as I find good decisions, and
too many characters who come off as walking allegories.</P>
<P>     PHILADELPHIA is the story of Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks), a
successful attorney in a large Philadelphia law firm.  He also happens
to be gay and HIV-positive, facts unknown to anyone in the law firm
when he is handed an extremely important case.  Soon, however, the
appearance of Karposi's sarcoma lesions on Andrew's face make it clear
that he has developed AIDS.  When crucial documents in the important
case appear to have been misplaced, Andrew is fired, ostensibly for
incompetence.  Andrew believes differently, and takes his case to Joe
Miller (Denzel Washington), an ambulance-chasing personal injury lawyer
with a profound streak of homophobia.  Joe decides to set aside his
personal feelings to represent Andrew and attempt to prove that he was
fired simply for being gay and a person with AIDS.</P>
<P>     PHILADELPHIA opens strongly with an effective montage of city
scenes, underscored by the wonderful new Bruce Springsteen song "The
Streets of Philadelphia."  We see Andrew as a typical workaholic
attorney, already living with HIV as part of his life.  It is to
screenwriter Ron Nyswaner's credit that it doesn't offer the stock
scene of a doctor delivering the somber news; HIV from the outset is
simply one element in Andrew's life, but not the defining element.  Joe
Miller is equally well-established, both at work and at home, as an
Everyman who recognizes somewhere the social similarities between being
a black man and being a person with AIDS.  PHILADELPHIA sets the stage
effectively, making the way this case will affect the two men the focal
point of the story.</P>
<P>     The problems begin once PHILADELPHIA hits the courtroom.  As a
courtroom drama, PHILADELPHIA is fairly pedestrian stuff, lacking real
dramatic punch and giving in to preachy speeches.  Demme makes the
extremely questionable decision of framing much of one lengthy trial
sequence from Andrew's perspective as he grows weaker.  There are
distracting camera angles and sound echoes which make it difficult to
concentrate on what anyone involved is actually saying.  Andrew's
condition became the total focus at a time when it simply wasn't
appropriate in the narrative.  Outside the courtroom things aren't much
better.  The relationship between Andrew and his partner Miguel
(Antonio Banderas) is practically an afterthought, and it struck me
that their one shared kiss is hidden from the camera by Hanks' head,
and that neither one ever says "I love you."  PHILADELPHIA's most
talked-about scene involves Andrew responding to an aria, a scene which
seems calculated to be one of those tour-de- force moments that wins
Oscars.  I found it way over the top.</P>
<P>     Hanks' performance has been touted as an Oscar front-runner, and
while he makes some bold choices, I don't feel it's the best work he's
done, or even the best work he's done this year.  With the exception of
the aforementioned aria scene, the character of Andrew stagnates, and
becomes more of a representative gay man with AIDS than a real person.
The same is true of Jason Robards as the senior partner in Andrew's
firm; he's too cut-and-dried, right down to citing the Bible on the
witness stand.  By far the best work, and the most dynamic character,
is Denzel Washington's Joe Miller.  Once again Washington fills the
screen with energy, and isn't afraid to show Miller's warts, making him
a very real typical American.</P>
<P>     As with THE WEDDING BANQUET, I went into PHILADELPHIA wanting to
like it and glad that it had been made.  But once again I felt the
message deserved a better messenger, one that treats homosexuality as
matter-of-factly as the recent TALES OF THE CITY miniseries on PBS.
PHILADELPHIA is a good idea, just not a particularly good film.</P>
