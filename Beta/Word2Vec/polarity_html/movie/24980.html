<P>     In a lifespan of just over 24 months, the Sex Pistols managed to
distill the entire history of rock and roll into one short-lived,
phenomenally influential experiment. There were internal disagreements and
lineup changes. There were distractions from meddling girlfriends and
drugs. There were legal and fiscal wranglings with a shady manager and
anxious record companies. There were cries of outrage from adults who just
didn't understand the rebellious messages of this new musical form,
accompanied by the certain knowledge that civilization as we knew it was
about to come to an end. And finally, there was the inevitable
transformation of rebellion and singularity into its own kind of
conformity. </P>
<P>     Anyone at all familiar with the Pistols would hope to high heaven
that a film-maker wouldn't choose to tell their story in the measured
tones of hero worship. No such worries under the direction of Julien
Temple, who turns THE FILTH AND THE FURY into a multi-media Sex Pistols 
assault. Temple frames his archival footage of the band with modern day
interviews with the band's four original members -- vocalist John "Johnny
Rotten" Lydon, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen
Matlock -- and a 1978 post break-up interview with replacement bassist
(and eventual heroin casualty) Sid Vicious. Their voices describe a band
born out of the social conditions of mid-1970s England, a music of furious
discontent that made the Sex Pistols as reviled by their critics as they
were adored by their fans. They also tell of the factions within the band
between those loyal to the Pistols' manager and self-described creator
Malcolm McLaren and those who distrusted his business dealings and staged
outrageousness.</P>
<P>     Many of the stories told in THE FILTH AND THE FURY are by now the
stuff of rock legend: the profane appearance on an English television
show; the performance of "God Save the Queen" on the Thames during the
celebration of Queen Elizabeth's silver anniversary jubilee; the
one-song-and-out final concert at San Francisco's Winterland in January
1978. Julien Temple has already documented the Sex Pistols in 1980's THE
GREAT ROCK 'N' ROLL SWINDLE, so there was the danger that THE FILTH AND
THE FURY would feel not just like a canonization of a pioneering band, but
a recycled canonization. Instead, Temple captures not just the energy of
the Pistols, but their satirical sense of playfulness as well. That
expletive-filled television interview is described as a drunken Steve
Jones having fun at the expense of the equally drunk host; jabs at
"progressive rock" contemporaries like Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer
are accompanied by footage of stop-motion dinosaurs. With music, animation
and dozens of archival clips, Temple compiles a film that doesn't merely
lay out a Sex Pistols chronology; it captures the atmosphere and the
attitude of anarchy in the U.K.</P>
<P>     That's not to say that it's instantly reliable as the definitive Sex
Pistols story. SWINDLE may have been an obvious attempt at
self-congratulation by McLaren, but THE FILTH AND THE FURY occasionally
seems just as much like an ego piece for Johnny Rotten. The present-day
interviews are conducted with the band members in shadow, an effective
means of keeping the story in the "present" of 1970s England. They also
allow Rotten in particular to "set the record straight" in a manner that
sounds theatrically performed every time he opens his mouth. Rotten may
very well be a more reliable historian of the Pistols than McLaren, but
when he and Jones relate differing accounts of a hotel room snafu, it's
hard not to here Rotten's version as a bit of overdramatization. Make no
mistake, it's still tremendously interesting listening to Rotten's
perspective on the rise and fall of the band. It's also a little hard to
take when he actually begins crying over the tragic end of his friend Sid
Vicious.</P>
<P>     That's actually a fairly minor quibble with a film as vital and
generally unpretentious as THE FILTH AND THE FURY (you don't get less
pretentious than Steve Jones' crudely honest reason for wanting to be in a
band). While Temple clearly appreciates the Sex Pistols as the defining
force in English punk -- including footage of youngsters Siouxsie Sioux,
Billy Idol and Pogues frontman Shane McGowan at concerts or singing
Pistols songs -- he also confronts the bands members' dissatisfaction with
how their legacy has been defined. Rotten in particular bemoans punk being
"absorbed back into the mainstream," with middle-class kids wearing
leather the real early English punks could never have afforded. He's also
surprisingly philosophical about the band's disintegration during its 1978
U.S. tour. "The Sex Pistols had to end when it did," Rotten opines, "but
it didn't have to end _how_ it did." Of course, he probably would be less
concerned with the philosophizing than pure sensory jolt, and that's
something THE FILTH AND THE FURY provides. It took the Sex Pistols two
years to distill rock and roll into every one of its basic elements. It
takes Julien Temple 108 minutes to do the same thing to the Sex Pistols. 
It's a story with the frantic, two-and-a-half-minute raw energy blast of a
classic punk anthem.</P>
