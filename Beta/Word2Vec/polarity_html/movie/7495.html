<P>     TRAVELLER, the directorial debut of veteran cinematographer Jack 
Green, takes us into the world of blood-related grifters who pull two-
bit cons as a way of life.  They are the "Travellers", a close-knit band 
of Irish-American nomads who survive by preying on the gullibility and 
greed of others.  This movie tells the story of one such Traveller and 
the forces that lead him to question his position within the society.</P>
<P>     Bokky (Bill Paxton) is near the top of the North Carolina Traveller 
hierarchy.  He is respected by his peers, and the local leader, Boss 
Jack (Luke Askew), regards him as the son he never had.  One Fall day, a 
young man, Pat (Mark Wahlberg), arrives to bury his exiled Traveller 
father in a Traveller cemetery, and is met with cold stares and harsh 
words.  As an outsider, he is regarded with suspicion, but the Traveller 
blood in his veins runs true and Bokky agrees to take Pat under his 
wing.  Soon, the two have become a team and are pulling off some pretty 
profitable schemes.  Everything is going smoothly until Bokky falls for 
Jean (Julianna Margulies), one of his intended victims, and his 
loyalties become confused.  </P>
<P>     The plot of TRAVELLER, credited to Jim McGlynn, isn't all that 
complex or hard to follow.  It's episodic in nature, with each new scam 
representing another chapter.  The cons are fun to watch unfold.  
Sometimes, it's possible to see where they're going, sometimes not.  The 
script is smart and sneaky -- by never telling the audience more than is 
necessary, it develops a keen sense of suspense that persists until the 
gritty final reel. </P>
<P>     The great strength of the film, however, is character development.  
The two leads, Bokky and Pat, both have clearly-defined arcs.  Pat, 
desperate to prove himself to Boss Jack, works hard to learn the tricks 
of the trade.  Meanwhile, Bokky, even while teaching Pat how to scam 
people, is starting to see his marks as human beings, and his resolve to 
rip them off is beginning to waver.  He is suddenly reluctant to swindle 
a young couple out of their life's savings.</P>
<P>     For the most part, the acting is top-notch.  Bill Paxton, taking a 
brief hiatus from blockbusters like TWISTER to do a serious role in a 
low-budget feature, brings charm, depth, and feeling to a part that 
could have come across as cold and amoral.  Julianna Margulies (PARADISE 
ROAD, TV's ER) smolders in this low-key performance.  Character actor 
James Gammon is delightful as a fellow scam artist who turns Pat and 
Bokky's duo into a trio.  Even Mark Wahlberg (the former Marky Mark), 
not known for his acting, is competent. </P>
<P>     Here and there, TRAVELLER takes a wrong turn.  The culture of the 
band, which is arguably the most absorbing feature of the film, is 
worthy of a more thorough exploration than is offered.  We're teased 
with a possible romantic relationship between Pat and the Boss' daughter 
(Nikki DeLoach), which might have uncovered another dimension of 
Traveller society, but this subplot is abruptly dropped during the 
movie's second half.  Indeed, there are several occasions when TRAVELLER 
glosses over things that cry out for greater investigation (such as 
Bokky's lessons about how to pull a successful scam).  Still, these are 
mostly small gripes, and their impact upon the viewing experience as a 
whole is minimal.  TRAVELLER, the latest in a sub-genre that's becoming 
known as "Southern Gothic" (and includes the likes of ONE FALSE MOVE and 
SLING BLADE), is a fine film, and worth a trip to a theater.</P>
