<P>     Here's a word analogy:  AMISTAD is to THE LOST WORLD as SCHINDLER'S 
LIST is to JURASSIC PARK. In 1993, after Steven Spielberg made the 
monster dino hit, many critics described SCHINDLER'S LIST as the 
director's "penance" (as if there was a need for him to apologize for 
making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster).  Now, after a three-year layoff, 
Spielberg is back with a vengeance.  Once again, his summer release was 
special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on 
human appetizers.  Now, following his 1993 pattern, he has fashioned 
another serious, inspirational Christmas release about the nature of 
humanity.  That film is AMISTAD.</P>
<P>     Although not as masterful as SCHINDLER'S LIST, AMISTAD is 
nevertheless a gripping motion picture.  Thematically rich, impeccably 
crafted, and intellectually stimulating, the only area where this movie 
falls a little short is in its emotional impact.  Watching SCHINDLER'S 
LIST was a powerful, almost spiritual, experience.  Spielberg pulled us 
into the narrative, absorbed us in the drama, then finally let us go, 
exhausted and shattered, three-plus hours later.  Aspects of the movie 
have stayed with me ever since.  AMISTAD, while a fine example of film 
making, is not as transcendent.  </P>
<P>     The incident of the ship La Amistad is not found in any history 
books, but, considering who writes the texts, that's not a surprise.  
However, the event is a part of the American social and legal fabric, 
and, while AMISTAD does not adhere rigorously to the actual account, 
most of the basic facts are in order.  Several, mostly minor changes 
have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force.  On the whole, 
while AMISTAD may not be faithful to all of the details of the 
situation, it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired.</P>
<P>     One stormy night during the summer of 1839, the 53 men imprisoned 
on the Spanish slave ship La Amistad escape.  Led by the lion-hearted 
Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), they take control of the vessel, killing most 
of the crew.  Adrift somewhere off the coast of Cuba and uncertain how 
to make their way back to Africa, they rely on the two surviving 
Spaniards to navigate the eastward journey.  They are tricked, however, 
and the La Amistad, which makes its way northward off the United States' 
eastern coastline, is eventually captured by an American naval ship near 
Connecticut.  The kidnapped Africans are shackled and thrown into 
prison, charged with murder and piracy.  </P>
<P>     The first men to come to the Africans' defense are abolitionists 
Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and Lewis Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard).  
They are soon joined by Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey), a property 
attorney of little repute.  Aided by advice from former President John 
Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins), Baldwin proves a more persuasive orator 
than anyone gave him credit for, and his central argument -- that the 
prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men, not property -- convinces 
the judge.  But powerful forces have aligned against Baldwin's cause.  
Current President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne), eager to please 
Southern voters and 11-year old Queen Isabella of Spain (Anna Paquin), 
begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the 
Africans goes free.  </P>
<P>     At its heart, AMISTAD is a tale of human courage.  Cinque is a 
heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain 
and indignity he is subjected to.  He is a free man, not a slave, and, 
while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle, he will 
not give it up.  Effectively portrayed by newcomer Djimon Hounsou, whose 
passion and screen presence arrest our attention, Cinque is the key to 
viewers seeing the AMISTAD Africans as more than symbols in a battle of 
ideologies.  They are individuals, and our ability to make that 
distinction is crucial to the movie's success.  To amplify this point, 
Spielberg presents many scenes from the Africans' point-of-view, 
detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the 
white man's seemingly-strange "rituals".</P>
<P>     The larger struggle is, of course, one of defining humanity.  As 
the Nazis felt justified in slaughtering Jews because they viewed their 
victims as "sub-human," so the pro-slavery forces of AMISTAD use a 
similar defense.  The abolitionists regard the Africans as men, but the 
slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property.  In a 
sense, the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of 
civil war, which would break out less than three decades later, looming 
over everything.</P>
<P>     AMISTAD's presentation of the legal and political intricacies 
surrounding the trial are fascinating, making this movie one of the most 
engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history.  Four claimants come 
forward against the Africans:  the state, which wants them tried for 
murder; the Queen of Spain, who wants them handed over to her under the 
provision of an American/Spanish treaty; two American naval officers, 
who claim the right of high seas salvage; and the two surviving 
Spaniards from La Amistad, who demand that their property be returned to 
them.  Baldwin must counter all of these claims, while facing a 
challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a 
relationship he develops with Cinque.  Even though attorney and client 
are divided by a language barrier, they gradually learn to communicate.</P>
<P>     Aside from Cinque, who is a fully-realized individual, 
characterization is spotty, but the acting is top-notch.  Matthew 
McConaughey successfully overcomes his "pretty boy" image to become 
Baldwin, but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of 
his role in the La Amistad case.  Likewise, while Morgan Freeman and 
Stellan Skarsgard are effective as Joadson and Tappan, they are never 
anything more than "abolitionists."  Nigel Hawthorne, who played the 
title character in THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE, presents Martin Van Buren 
as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an 
election.  Finally, there's Anthony Hopkins, whose towering portrayal of 
John Quincy Adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has 
recently done.  Hopkins, who can convincingly play such diverse figures 
as a serial killer, an emotionally-crippled English butler, and Richard 
Nixon, makes us believe that he is Adams.  His ten-minute speech about 
freedom and human values is unforgettable.  </P>
<P>     One point of difference worth noting between AMISTAD and 
SCHINDLER'S LIST is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain.  
SCHINDLER'S LIST had Ralph Fiennes' superbly-realized Amon Goeth, who 
was not only a three-dimensional character, but a personification of all 
that the Nazis stood for.  There is no such figure in AMISTAD.  The 
villain is slavery, but an ideology, no matter how evil, is rarely the 
best adversary.  It is to Spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such 
a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist.</P>
<P>     AMISTAD's trek to the screen, which encountered some choppy waters 
(author Barbara Chase-Riboud has cried plagiarism, a charge denied by 
the film makers), comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the 
incident.  An opera of the same name opened in Chicago on November 29, 
1997.  Numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore 
shelves.  It remains to be seen how much longevity the AMISTAD phenomena 
has, but one thing is certain -- with Spielberg's rousing, substantive 
film leading the way, the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of 
American history.</P>
