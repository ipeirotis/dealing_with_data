<P>     The turning point in Christina Ricci's career came when she chose 
to appear in Ang Lee's THE ICE STORM.  Since then, nothing has been the 
same for the up-and-coming performer.  Before the 1997 feature, Ricci 
had turned up in host of bland, family-oriented features (THE ADDAMS 
FAMILY, CASPER, NOW & THEN, GOLD DIGGERS) as an innocent young girl.  
Although the films were often easy to dismiss, the actress' consistently 
fine performances were not.  Finally, with THE ICE STORM, Ricci was 
given a role of import in a film of substance.  Her portrayal of a 
sexually voracious teenager who sleeps with boys of her age (and 
younger) is riveting, and it ignited a phase in Ricci's career that has 
had her playing a drug-addled artist (FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS), 
an alluring hostage-turned-girlfriend (BUFFALO 66), and a promiscuous 
young woman who uses her sexuality as a weapon (THE OPPOSITE OF SEX).  </P>
<P>     Ricci's performance is only one reason why Don Roos' THE OPPOSITE 
OF SEX is a success.  This is perhaps the most audacious film of the 
year to date (at least among mainstream releases), filling the slot left 
vacant by 1997's IN THE COMPANY OF MEN.  THE OPPOSITE OF SEX is the kind 
of daring feature that doesn't open every Friday at the local multiplex; 
its frank, sometimes politically incorrect approach towards the act and 
politics of sex is refreshing.  And, in addition to dealing with 
intrinsically provocative material, first-time director Roos uses the 
unique approach of satirizing the conventions of road pictures and 
dysfunctional family dramas to tell his story.  In particular, he has a 
lot of fun with the voice-over.  The glib narrator, Deedee Truitt 
(Ricci), is aware that she's speaking to a movie audience, and, as a 
result, can't resist the opportunity to have some fun at the viewer's 
expense.  In her opening monologue, she informs us that "things get very 
complicated very quick, and you're going to have trouble getting through 
it without me talking," then, in case we mistake her for a cute-but-
misunderstood 16-year old, she warns us that "I don't have a heart of 
gold and I don't grow one later."  When a gun makes a brief appearance, 
she tells us not to forget about it.  ("Duh.  It's foreshadowing.")  At 
another time, she "shows" scenes of things that don't really happen, 
then laughs at our gullibility for believing them. </P>
<P>     Although Deedee is the narrator and, consequently, has the largest 
speaking part, she's not the film's central character.  That role 
belongs to her half-brother, Bill (Martin Donovan), "the definition of a 
softy."  Bill, a gay high school teacher, has been leading a peaceful 
existence until his pregnant sister runs away from home and comes to him 
for shelter.  Unablet to refuse anyone anything, he lets Deedee stay, 
and she repays his kindness by seducing his live-in lover, Matt (Ivan 
Sergei), who, after his fling with Deedee, decides that he's not really 
a homosexual – he's a bisexual.  Another constant presence in Bill's 
life is the always-miserable Lucia (Lisa Kudrow), the sister of his dead 
true love.  Then there are Jason (Johnny Galecki), who falsely tells the 
police that Bill molested him, and Sheriff Carl Tippett (Lyle Lovett), 
the genial cop who investigates the boy's claims. </P>
<P>     As comedies go, THE OPPOSITE OF SEX is one of 1998's most 
consistently funny.  Of course, humor is subjective, and I'm known for 
being a little warped in that area, so Roos' flamboyant, out-on-a-limb 
approach is perfect for someone like me.  The dialogue is crisp and 
distinctive, occasionally invoking the spirit of something written by 
Kevin Smith (CLERKS, CHASING AMY).  However, it's obvious to Roos (and 
to us) that this kind of slick, unconventional style can have trouble 
sustaining a feature-length movie.  No matter how outrageous the tone, 
it grows tiresome after a while, so the writer/director changes gears 
during the second half.  Although THE OPPOSITE OF SEX never completely 
loses its satirical, self-mocking edge, the final 50 minutes are more 
serious than what precedes them, and the humor is leavened by a couple 
of earnest, surprisingly-effective messages.  One particularly 
intriguing concept is Carl's assertion that maybe sex isn't for 
recreation or procreation, but for concentration – that when a man and 
woman sleep together, the experience attunes them to each other.  This 
is in contrast with Deedee's largely-negative view of sex.  For her, 
it's a burden that leads to such undesirable results as "kids, or 
disease, or relationships."  </P>
<P>     While Ricci's performance in THE OPPOSITE OF SEX is the standout, 
it's not the most surprising example of acting, at least when one 
considers her previous critical acclaim.  Instead, that distinction goes 
to Lisa Kudrow, who abandons the ditzy image she has refined on 
television (FRIENDS, MAD ABOUT YOU) and in movies (MOTHER, ROMY & 
MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION) in favor of a well-rounded portrayal of 
a bitter, lonely woman.  Lucia proves that Kudrow has a rarely-displayed 
range.  So, with Ricci and Kudrow leading the way, the women in THE 
OPPOSITE OF SEX are far more interesting than the men.  Martin Donovan 
underplays Bill as smart, affable, and bland.  Ivan Sergei plays Matt as 
dumb, affable, and bland.  And Lyle Lovett portrays Carl as strange, 
affable, and bland.</P>
<P>     The tag line for THE OPPOSITE OF SEX is:  "You'll laugh, you'll 
cry, you'll be offended."  While that's perhaps overstating the movie's 
impact, it's not completely off-base.  The film manages to mix a portion 
of successful drama into its primarily-comic foundation, and 
conservative movie-goers will likely be turned off by the no-punches 
pulled, occasionally raunchy look at sex.  However, with its memorable 
dialogue, solid performances, and idiosyncratic style, THE OPPOSITE OF 
SEX is sure to be appreciated by those who aren't frightened away by the 
cinematic equivalent of hot chili.</P>
