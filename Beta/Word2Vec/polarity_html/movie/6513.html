<P>     Shortly after midnight on a steamy June evening in 1963, civil 
rights activist Medgar Evers was shot to death outside his home in 
Jackson, Mississippi.  One shot, fired from a high-power rifle, exploded 
through his chest, ripped through the nearby wall of his house, 
ricocheted off a refrigerator, and broke a coffee pot.  The assassin was 
white supremacist Byron De La Beckwith, a man with such an intimidating 
personality that even the KKK feared him.  De La Beckwith was captured, 
but, after two trials ended in hung juries, he went free.  When, 30 
years later, at the behest of Evers' widow, Myrlie, Assistant DA Bobby 
DeLaughter re-opened the case, he had no idea of the difficulties he 
would face in obtaining a new indictment.  Evidence was missing, 
witnesses had died, and even the official court transcripts of the 
original trials could not be located.  On top of that, DeLaughter's own 
wife turned against him and his life was threatened.  Undaunted, he 
pursued the case, determined to see it through to the end.</P>
<P>     GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI, director Rob Reiner's 1996 Academy Award 
contender and his follow-up to last year's THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, tells 
this compelling story using a solid, if somewhat unconventional, cast.  
The lead, Bobby DeLaughter, goes to Alec Baldwin, the most "serious" 
actor in his family.  Baldwin is fine in the role, although far from 
Oscar material.  Whoopi Goldberg gives an uneven performance as Myrlie 
Evers, starting out rather unconvincingly, but finishing strong.  James 
Woods, who almost always plays bad guys these days, is creepy and 
unsettling as the despicably cock-sure De La Beckwith.  The supporting 
cast functions admirably, and includes Craig T. Nelson (TV's "Coach") as 
DeLaughter's boss, Diane Ladd (RAMBLING ROSE) as his mother-in-law, 
William H. Macy (FARGO) as his assistant, and Virginia Madsen (THE 
PROPHECY) as his racist wife.</P>
<P>     As a courtroom drama, GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI is reasonably 
successful.  The trial, which carefully follows the actual transcript 
from 1994, avoids the contrived, theatrical twists that mar many similar 
films.  There are no surprise witnesses or unexpected moves by either 
the prosecution or the defense.  Each side presents its case, then 
leaves the final decision in the hands of the jury.  As a result of this 
verisimilitude, the courtroom aspects of GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI are 
intelligent rather than over-the-top.  We care about the characters and 
what happens to them.</P>
<P>     As an examination of how the Civil Rights movement has changed 
lifestyles and attitudes in Mississippi (and, by extension, across the 
entire country) during the last 30 years, GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI is less 
effective.  One problem, which at least makes one wonder about the 
film's intentions, is fairly obvious:  this is yet another example of a 
story where a white hero enters the Civil Rights fray and becomes the 
lead player.  Even though this is the way events actually happened (the 
real DeLaughter is Caucasian), there's little doubt that setting up a 
white man (Alec Baldwin) as the central figure makes the film more 
"accessible" and appealing to the predominantly-white, mainstream crowds 
who frequent multiplexes. </P>
<P>     Even though none of this material is groundbreaking, it is 
presented in an interesting manner.  Reiner uses this situation to 
investigate two prevalent, albeit contradictory, views of how the Civil 
Rights movement has changed the nation.  Either we are making slow 
progress, step by step, to a better future, or, "emotionally, we will 
always be segregated."  DeLaughter's conscience becomes the battleground 
for these viewpoints.  But, although the script is tightly-written for 
the most part, there are times when it lapses into sermonizing (such as 
when DeLaughter tries to explain to his young children why Evers was a 
great man).  </P>
<P>     Whatever its faults, GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI is certainly an 
involving drama.  However, while I have no doubt that Reiner meant for 
this to be an indictment against racist attitudes and a survey of some 
of the successes and failures of the Civil Rights movement, it succeeds 
only sporadically at those goals.  At times, GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI 
resembles nothing more lofty than a toned-down, historically-grounded 
version of A TIME TO KILL.  (A white man in the "new" South faces racism 
and personal danger for defending the "black" perspective.)  So, 
although I recommend GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI and believe that it deserves 
to find a wide audience, I am cognizant that this is not a perfect 
motion picture.  It is occasionally thought-provoking, but rarely 
haunting.</P>
