<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It could be almost like a documentary that someone like ESPN would do,
such as there 'When Baseball was a Game,' but in this Depression-era
nostalgia piece about a genuine Jewish baseball superstar  --
supposedly, the first one who openly said he was Jewish and wouldn't
change his name -- the game becomes much more than what it is. It
becomes a look at the social and political climate of America just as
much as a baseball biography. This breezy documentary by the woman
director, Aviva Kempner, which took her 12 years to get enough funds to
release it, sings the praises of  the likable original "Hammering Hank,"
a baseball Hall of Fame slugger and an heroic figure among his Jewish
fans, and it relates the anti-Semitism that was present in the 1930s and
1940s. He was hailed as a messiah, a counter argument against those who
never imagined a Jew could be such a physical player, a star in
America's game. He broke the stereotype people had of Jews, because of
his natural ability and physical presence. Alan Dershowitz, the infamous
lawyer, says that he was the most important Jew of that period, giving
hope to all the others through his accomplishments, allowing them to
think that they could fit into the mainstream. He was articulate, a
great player, a great role model, had a great work ethic, and though not
a religious Jew, he realized how important his heritage was and how
others looked up to him to do what is right, and he would not play on
Yom Kippur, even during a pennant race, thusly gaining the respect of
the American public.</P>
<P>Born in 1911 in the Bronx, to Roumanian immigrant parents, he grew to
six-foot-four-inches while at James Monroe H.S. and attracted baseball
scouts from the hometown New York Yankees and the Detroit Tigers, but
wisely chose to sign with the Tigers because the great Lou Gehrig was a
fixture at first base for the Yanks. Also, the Tiger scout promised his
parents that they will let him go to college. But baseball was in Hank's
blood and he signed a bonus to play with Detroit forgoing his education
at N.Y.U., and after a short stint in the minors, he was called up to
the big club for the 1933 season. He immediately fitted into the team,
playing on an infield that had the great second baseman Charlie
Gehringer, an infield that would eventually set a record for how many
r.b.i's it would drive in. The team was good enough to win the pennant
in 1934 and give life to a town that was hit hard by the Depression.
Detroit was also noted for having two of the most vociferous
anti-Semites, Henry Ford and Father Coughlin, and for some bigoted fans
who couldn't accept him, calling him a sheenie and a kike from the
stands. But most of the vicious taunts came from opposing teams, who all
employed bench jockeys to call him anti-Semitic names. Of all the white
ballplayers, he was picked on the most because of his religion.
Interestingly, Jackie Robinson came up in 1947 the same year Hank called
it quits. Jackie went on to break the color-line and was the only player
to receive a harder time than Hank. It was as if Hank was passing the
baton to Jackie.</P>
<P>He was the first ballplayer to earn $100,000, which came during his last
season when he was suspiciously traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on the
whim of Tiger owner Mr. Briggs and not allowed to end his career with
the Tigers.</P>
<P>Greenberg's accomplishments on the ballfield are legendary. During the
1938 season, he was chasing Babe Ruth's 60 home-run record, and ended up
hitting 58 homers. He was the team leader that helped power the Tigers
to consecutive pennants in 1934 and 1935, as the Tigers won their first
World Series in '35. In 1945, after being the first ballplayer to enlist
in the service, he returned from World War 11 to lead the Tigers to
another pennant. Hank was proudest of the runs he drove in, in one year
he drove in 183 runs, one less than the record held by Gehrig. He also
became the first man to win most valuable player awards at two
positions, first base and left field. There is no doubt about it, Hank
was an inspiration to many people who needed such a heroic figure.</P>
<P>This film had a very skillful way of telling its story about a bygone
era, doing it in an effortlessly grand style, with a tongue-in-cheek
humor. Besides, any film that has a clip of the Marx Brothers breaking
up a symphony orchestra to make it seem like a baseball game, has a good
idea of when to be humorous and when to point out the seriousness of the
slurs Hank had to go through. Hank was a class act, never openly
complaining about what he went through, just talking about it because
that was the real way it was. He never even complains about how the
pitchers stopped pitching against him when he was closing in on the
Babe. He became living proof of Jewish acceptance in America. This
documentary makes use of the ones who loved Hank, by interviews with his
family, his fans, other players, sports writers, and celebrities.</P>
<P>The only fault of the film, was that the director became too close to
his subject, and perhaps, overdramatized the effects of Greenberg.
Though he was the ultimate Jewish sports hero of the time, there were
others who played important roles in allowing the Jews to become more
easily accepted into the American mainstream. The conclusion of WW11
also had a lot to do with the change of America's attitude, though it is
doubtful if anti-Semitism is through for good, as there are still other
barriers in America that have to be broken down, such as having a Jewish
president.</P>
