<PRE>THE PRICE OF MILK
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>The opening credits of THE PRICE OF MILK, a sweet, romantic fairytale 
from New Zealand's writer and director Harry Sinclair, are slowly 
revealed as a sleeping couple fights for control of a quilt.  As mounds 
of material are smoothed out, the embroidered names appear.  The quilt 
itself turns out to play a pivotal role in a movie that is so completely 
original that it's hard to describe.  Think of it as a wonderfully 
romantic Irish leprechaun story -- heavily scored with classical Russian 
pieces played by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra -- about missing quilts, 
cows and voices.  </P>
<P>Having trouble forming that vision in your head?  I'm not surprised, as 
this cute little charmer is a film to be experienced, not analyzed.  
Some of its best humor makes no sense whatsoever if you apply logic, but 
it sure is funny.  Nigel, for example, is the farm's dog, but, since he 
suffers from severe agoraphobia, he is seen only as a moving, barking 
box that is used to allay his fears.</P>
<P>Lucinda (Danielle Cormack) and Rob (Karl Urban) are two free spirits in 
their twenties who live together in relative poverty and absolute bliss 
on Rob's dairy farm.  They are hopelessly, head over heels in love.  
Lucinda, with her long curly, blond hair, looks like a cross between a 
doll and a hippie.  The disheveled Rob has a resemblance to Brad Pitt's 
gypsy in SNATCH.  In a New Zealand version of the California hot tub -- 
an old bathtub set out in the open and heated by coals -- Rob proposes 
to Lucinda by passing a ring under the water to her.  I thought she was 
going to wear it on her toe.  It's that kind of story.</P>
<P>In place of leprechauns we have "The Jacksons," whom everyone knows 
about, but no one is quite sure what they look like or even what size 
they are.  Some people think that they are tiny, and others believe that 
they are giants.  Rangi Motu plays a pixyish character known only as 
Auntie, who is clearly one of the infamous Jacksons.  She and her 8 
grown nephews, who are all about the same size and age, keep getting the 
upper hand in a series of encounters with our young lovers.  These 
confrontations put a strain on Rob and Lucinda's relationship, allowing 
the story to move beyond its comedic roots.  </P>
<P>The whimsical, romantic and dramatic music so makes the movie that it 
would be hard to envision the film without it.  Besides Nikolai 
Rimsky-Korsakov, there is music from lesser known Russian composers, 
including Alexander Tcherepnin.</P>
<P>I can't think of any movie quite like THE PRICE OF MILK.  In a time in 
which every movie seems as fresh as microwaved leftovers, THE PRICE OF 
MILK proudly stands alone.  And speaking of microwaves, Lucinda swears 
by them.  Nothing like nuking a big bowl of previously frozen English 
peas to satisfy her man.</P>
<P>THE PRICE OF MILK runs a breezy 1:27.  It is rated PG-13 for drug use, 
sensuality and brief nudity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up.</P>
