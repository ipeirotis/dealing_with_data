<PRE>JULIEN DONKEY-BOY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>I have good news for you.  You -- yes, you! -- could be a filmmaker and
have your name in lights.</P>
<P>No, you don't have to go to film school.  You don't have to think of a
story.  And you don't even have to film your movie; you already have the
ingredients on the shelves in your den -- those homemade videotapes.
No, not those sharp looking new ones made with your fancy new camcorder.
Those old, grainy, shaky ones, in which your subjects ramble
quasi-unintelligibly.  Take those, purposely assemble the clips in
random order, and, voilà, you are a filmmaker.  Your masterpiece can
even win the "Dogme 95" seal of approval, which says that your film was
made without use of artificial lights, sounds, props, etc.</P>
<P>Lest you think the chance of your rise to fame is a pipe dream, consider
JULIEN DONKEY-BOY by writer and director Harmony Korine (KIDS and
GUMMO).  There is probably a story buried there somewhere, but it takes
the press notes to decipher it, not that you'd care.  The film is the
first American movie made according to the Dogme 95 precepts.</P>
<P>Sandwiched between long cinematic wastelands are periodic incidents
designed to disgust us.  One has the lead character, Julien (Ewen
Bremner), take out his false teeth at dinner and dunk them several times
in his red soda.  (The colors in the film are so far off that one can
never be sure what the actual color was.)  Another has Julien leaning
over the camera as spit comes out from his mouth and snot drops from his
nose.  In the story's pièce de résistance, a performer comes to
entertain some kids.  His trick is that he stuffs more and more lit
cigarettes into his mouth, pretending to swallow them.  Eventually he
crams in an entire dozen and then spits them all back out, still
smoking.  Impressed, huh?</P>
<P>In another episode, an armless card player jokes about not having a card
up his sleeve.  And then there's the incident in which Julien's father
(Werner Herzog) wants Julien to put on the dress of his dead mother so
the father can dance with him.</P>
<P>"Shut up, shut up," the father says after hearing Julien recite a poem
made up almost entirely of the word "chaos."  "I don't really like it.
It's too artsy-fartsy."  The father then goes on to describe part of a
"real movie" -- a Dirty Harry movie.  The father's mere description of a
scene from that movie was better than the entire JULIEN DONKEY-BOY, a
movie so edgy that you'd like to push it off the edge of a cliff.</P>
<P>JULIEN DONKEY-BOY runs a tediously long 1:36.  It is rated R for
language, some sexuality and disturbing images.  It would be acceptable
for teenagers, who would likely be just as bored as the adults.</P>
