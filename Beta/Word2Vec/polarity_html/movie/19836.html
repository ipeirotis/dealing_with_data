CRUISE, THE (director: Bennett Miller; cinematographer: Bennett Miller;
cast: Timothy "Speed" Levitch, 1998)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"The Cruise" could be described as a whirling dervish tour both of New
York City and of Levitch's fertile persona. The guide, a struggling
28-year-old playwright, living in other people's homes to help him get
by on his $10 an hour pay scale at Gray Line Tours (he earns about $200
a week). He chose to work at this smaller tour company because his
former job at the bigger Apple Line, did not pay as much. This
documentary gives us a rapid-fire tour of the city and his lifestyle,
and is both an encyclopedic look at the city and a slyly amusing look at
the loquacious tour guide. According to him, the cruise is his
philosophy of life: "it is about flesh, respect, exhibitionism-- it is
looking at a flower's beauty and becoming the flower, and the flower
looking back at him." He is the eccentric, Bob Dylan look-alike, named
Timothy "Speed" Levitch, in need of approval from an audience for a job
well done.</P>
<P>In a place like Manhattan where it is easy to get lost in its few
million people, it is non-conformists' characters like Speed that make
things interesting and worthwhile. His tour emphasizes his love-hate
relationship with the city, which is now in its August love phase. A
tour that became legendary in the few years he worked for this company,
drawing an international array of tourists atop the double-decker bus
that tours Manhattan's 2.4 million people (under his breath he says he
heard the other day the figure might actually be 1.7 million, but I
don't care).</P>
<P>There are 200,000 people who work at the World Trade Center, he
mockingly tells us, as it sinks in how much humanity that is to be in
such a small space. He, also, tells us that he likes to
spin around under the twin towers of the World Trade Center and, when
thoroughly disoriented, to look up and reel under the illusion that the
buildings are toppling down on him.</P>
<P>His knowledge of the literary figures and where they lived is truly
spellbinding, as he tells about where Thomas Paine died, Mark Twain
lived, where the opium smoking Edgar Allan Poe wrote the "The Raven,"
how the poet Dylan Thomas died in the White Horse Tavern after having 16
martinis and his last words were bring me another.</P>
<P>His view of the Chrysler Building, quoting the critic Lewis Mumford,
that the top three floors which are an imitation of the Chrysler's car
front grill, is of an "uninspired voluptuousness." That Central Park was
designed by the transcendentalist Fredrick Law Olmstead, whose vision
for the park was not to play baseball or jog or roller blade or a place
in which to work up a sweat but to focus on nature in a peaceful
meditation.</P>
<P>Speed confesses he took the job mainly to pick up girls. Work to him is
one of the poisons of civilization. Civilization is a place that is
splitting us part; it encourages people to never say the truth. One
feels nauseous but not sick in it. This is a most unusual opinion for a
tour guide to have who is promoting the accomplishments of one of
civilization's most advanced cities. Speed is more at home telling us
the cruise is a way of being yourself and about how Henry James lived
his life here, than he is about impressing the tour with the huge
phallic symbol the tour bus approaches, called the Empire State
Building.</P>
<P>He drops the names of celebrities to point out where they reside, but
when he mentions Greta Garbo, he says she chose to live in NYC because
it was the only place in the world where she could be alone.</P>
<P>He gets a childish glee when reading from a sign he sees on one of the
buildings near where he is free-loading, saying 'Everything You Know Is
Wrong'. For him, it is these little things in life that one notices that
give it its relevance. What apparently irks him, is that his
grandparents consider him to be a failure because he doesn't have a
regular type of job and is materially floundering. This causes him to go
off on one of his diatribes about his need for personal freedom, which
shows him to be a bit insecure, even with all his bravado when he
intellectualizes. But he was confident enough of himself to quit his job
and go into business for himself after this documentary; he now gives
his own private tours.</P>
<P>I loved this ecclectic tour; it is shot in a clear video which is
blown-up to 35mm, and looks magnificent in B & W, giving the film the
proper atmospheric expression for its tour; the documentary works so
well because Speed's for real, as is his flowery monologue and his
genuine NYC nasal accent. His battle with his tour line wanting him to
wear a uniform to work or else they will have to let him go, is one that
I side wholly with him: Stop trying to make people conform. If you were
ever interested in a tour of NYC, this is a good one to catch, and you
don't even have to visit the city.</P>
