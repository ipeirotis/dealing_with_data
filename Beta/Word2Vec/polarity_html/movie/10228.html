<P>     The scrutiny surrounding TOMORROW NEVER DIES, the eighteenth 
"official" James Bond film (not counting CASINO ROYALE or NEVER SAY 
NEVER AGAIN), isn't as intense as it was around GOLDENEYE, but the 
attendant hype is, if anything, even more severe.  Product tie-ins are 
everywhere.  Turn on the TV, and you'll see Pierce Brosnan's Bond 
hocking cars and credit cards.  (Product placements in the film are at 
an all-time high.)  With GOLDENEYE, producers Barbara Broccoli and 
Michael G. Wilson successfully re-invented 007 for the '90s (although, 
truth be told, little modification was necessary) and proved that the 
venerable action hero could still be a viable box office draw (GOLDENEYE 
was the first Bond film to break the $100 million mark).  Now, with 
TOMORROW NEVER DIES, it's back to business as usual -- continuing the 
once-again healthy franchise. </P>
<P>     TOMORROW NEVER DIES is a better film than GOLDENEYE.  In fact, it's 
the best Bond film in many years.  For the first time since the 
legendary Sean Connery left the part, this movie feels like a Connery 
Bond adventure.  Pierce Brosnan, having left behind the jitters he 
occasionally exhibited during GOLDENEYE, now inhabits his character with 
a suave confidence that is very like Connery's.  The villain of the 
piece, Elliot Carver (played with panache by Jonathan Pryce), is cut 
from the Blofeld/Goldfinger mold -- sinister, cunning, and charismatic.  
(How many of the Roger Moore/Timothy Dalton bad guys fit this type?)  
The henchman, Stamper (Gotz Otto), bears more than a passing resemblance 
to Robert Shaw's killer in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.  The ever-reliable "Q" 
(Desmond Llewelyn) is still around, showing off his latest wares and 
telling 007 to "grow up."  Added to that are the usual Bond girls (Teri 
Hatcher and Michelle Yeoh), the gadgets, the chase scenes, the fights, 
the explosions, and a John Barry-esque score (by David Arnold) that 
makes repeated and effective use of the "James Bond Theme."</P>
<P>     As is usually the case in a 007 flick, the bad guy is a 
megalomaniac.  There's a twist, however -- Carver doesn't want to rule 
the world, he wants to rule the world's media.  The Rupert Murdoch-like 
figure is launching his own cable news network, and, to encourage 
viewers to tune in, he has decided to literally make headlines.  Using 
the advanced technological capabilities of the Carver Media Group, he 
engineers a conflict in the South China Sea between two Chinese planes 
and the HMS DEVONSHIRE.  The ship is sunk and one of the planes is 
destroyed.  War between China and Britain looms, with Carver having the 
inside story.  And that's where Bond comes in.</P>
<P>     Equipped with a brand new BMW that can almost drive itself, 007 
goes undercover into Carver's empire, pretending to be a banker.  At a 
posh party held by the tycoon, he meets Carver's wife, Paris (Teri 
Hatcher), an old flame.  Also present is Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh), a 
Chinese secret agent posing as a newswoman.  It doesn't take long for 
Bond to rub someone the wrong way, and soon he's ducking behind a 
printing press to escape a hail of bullets, then racing through the 
streets of Hamburg in his souped-up car.  With the clock ticking, Bond 
and Wai Lin have less than forty-eight hours to stop World War III.</P>
<P>     In TOMORROW NEVER DIES, the series breaks a little new ground.  Wai 
Lin becomes the first "Bond girl" to function more as a partner for 007 
than as a love interest, someone to be rescued, or both.  Played by Hong 
Kong star Michelle Yeoh (also known as Michelle Khan), who is best known 
in America as Jackie Chan's co-star in SUPERCOP, this character is just 
as physical and lethal as Bond, and she never screams for help.  Brosnan 
and Yeoh click, and if there was ever a Bond girl worth considering for 
an encore, Wai Lin is it.</P>
<P>     I can't be as positive regarding Teri Hatcher, who turns the 
supposedly-exotic Paris into a bland, unalluring figure.  Her shared 
past with 007 is supposed to bring out his vulnerable side (last seen at 
the end of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE), but it's hard to believe 
that such an uninteresting person could inspire any kind of emotion.  
Hatcher is the film's most obvious weak link -- fortunately, her screen 
time is limited.  </P>
<P>     The action sequences are suitably entertaining.  It's impossible to 
count the number of bullets fired, and there are pyrotechnics aplenty, 
including exploding missiles, a fireworks show on the ground, and a 
fairly spectacular climactic conflagration.  There are a couple of 
memorable chases, including one with a driverless car and another with a 
low-flying helicopter closing in on a motorcycle.  For those who crave 
flashes, bangs, narrow escapes, and other action film staples, TOMORROW 
NEVER DIES delivers.</P>
<P>     While the script isn't as openly jokey as some of the Roger Moore 
screenplays, it contains a fair number of one-liners.  While some of 
these are predictable, several of them are unforgettably witty.  "M" 
(MRS. BROWN's Judi Dench) makes an acid comment about the roles of men 
and women in the politics of war, and Moneypenney (Samantha Bond) offers 
a pun about Bond's canny knowledge of different languages (surely the 
best line of the film).  There's also some playful repartee between 007 
and his Chinese counterpart.</P>
<P>     Bond fans will likely love this movie.  Detractors will yawn it 
away as "more of the same."  In a way, however, that's the point.  No 
one really wants Bond to change or evolve, at least not significantly.  
We attend movies like TOMORROW NEVER DIES because they offer a 
predictably entertaining time with a popular superhero who can save the 
world with one hand while holding his vodka martini (shaken, not 
stirred) in the other.  TOMORROW NEVER DIES isn't fundamentally much 
different from GOLDENEYE or GOLDFINGER, for that matter.  It's the same 
basic formula put to effective use.  What separates a good Bond movie 
from a bad one isn't the plot -- it's the supporting cast, the 
intangibles, and the energy level.  With only a few exceptions, TOMORROW 
NEVER DIES scores high marks in all three categories.  Following this 
effort, there's no doubt that, once again, James Bond will return.</P>
