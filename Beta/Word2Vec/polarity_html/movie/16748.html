<P>UNMADE BEDS (director: Nicholas Barker; cast: Brenda Monte, Michael De
Stephano, Aimee Copp, Mikey Russo, 1997)</P>
<P>Whether the story is entirely true or in some parts made up, as the
director stated it is, is unimportant; the film covers the intriguing
subject matter of how four single New Yorkers exist for a period of
nine months, featuring the real lives of two female and two male
actors who play themselves, concerned with getting older and still
being single. Their single scene is provocatively portrayed as being
sad and luridly comical. It is a film that highlights the problems
that can be found in urban areas across America, as we bear witness to
the plight of these singles trying to search for a mate through the
internet and the personals, faced with agonizing loneliness and
unresolved psychological problems. That these four are not
particularly people that I can readily sympathize with, does not alter
the fact that this is a very human story being told, one that has many
implications on our culture, relating how alienated a people so many
of us have become in this modern world.</P>
<P>The result is an interesting and stylized docudrama, a "Rear Window"
for singles. The film imitates those famous apartment windows Jimmy
Stewart looked into for that 1950s look at New York City. This time it
is not a crime that we see, but is a voyeurist's delight, and there is
something that seems to excite us when we sneak a look at what someone
does in the privacy of their own home, as if we are seeing something
about them that we shouldn't see. But it is the four singles who
remain the focus of the film, which is really not a documentary,
except in its style.</P>
<P>Brenda Monte is Italian, she does not care for Jewish men and will not
even consider dating them because she does not find them attractive,
she is most proud of her big breasts, has a 20-year-old daughter from
a previously failed marriage, and she tells us she receives no child
support for her. This could be a personal ad about her, if it also
included that she wants a guy not for sex or love(she can have sex
whenever she wants to), but for monetary reasons. She wants to work
out some deal with a guy where they come to some arrangement
satisfactory to both of them, but she must get money for it, and it
should be clear that she is not a prostitute. Her vulgar story is
interspliced with the three other stories, but there is no connecting
links to the others.</P>
<P>Michael De Stephano is the nicest one of the four, except this little
negative fixation he has about homosexuals. It probably stems from his
fear that people will think that he is queer because he is not
married. He is a 40-year-old romantic, who is troubled that women find
his diminuitive height to be a no-no for them. He wants a permanent
relationship with marriage in mind. He is serious, stable, and
straightforward, and sounds a lot like what women want in guy, but he
says that is what they say they want, but in reality they are really
attracted to the jerks who lie to them and treat them badly, going
after them just for the sex.</P>
<P>Aimee Copp has the most serious problems of the four, she is obese,
depressive, has lost hope, suffers from a poor image of herself, and
desperately wants to get married.  She relates these feelings to her
lifetime childhood friend Laurie, who happens to be skinny, and is not
faced with the tormenting dating problems her 28-year-old friend is
having.</P>
<P>Mikey Russo is a braggart, who backs up his claims that he only goes
out with beauties by showing snapshots of some of his previous
dates. He is obnoxious but not as obnoxious as he makes himself out to
be. Though it is very hard to feel sympathy for him, especially after
he shows us how he will get out of a date with a mutt, which in his
lingo, is an ugly dog, by having someone at work beep him so he can
make an excuse to leave. This 54-year-old failed screenwriter and
current security director prides himself on being a gentleman, and
makes no bones about the fact that he is a womanizer, and admits that
he is his own worst enemy. All he wants in life is to take an
attractive lady to bed.</P>
<P>This film might be upsetting to some, but it is a fresh look at an old
problem, and its aim is readily accomplished, as it offers us an
unorthodox study in human behavior under the guise of being a
documentary.</P>
