<P>     Albert Finney is one of today's best character actors, and lately
he's been spending a lot of time in the skin of a lonely, aging
Irishman.  In addition to his role as the father in THE RUN OF THE
COUNTRY, he has appeared as a similar character in THE PLAYBOYS and A
MAN OF NO IMPORTANCE.  Similar, yet not the same.  Accomplished thespian
that he is, Finney does something subtly different with each of the
parts, and though many of the particulars are the same, no one would
confuse any of the three men.</P>
<P>     Yet Finney's character is not the focus of THE RUN OF THE COUNTRY.
His is a supporting role, presenting an opportunity for conflict with
his teenage son, Danny (Matthew Keeslar).  This is Danny's story--how,
coping with the recent death of his beloved mother, he struggles to find
independence from an overbearing father.  Part of this process is moving
out of his childhood home and in with his friend, Prunty (Anthony
Brophy), a cattle herder with a love of booze and a penchant for crude
talk.  Another part is falling in love.  The object of his affection is
Annagh (Victoria Smurfit), a girl from just north of the border
separating Catholic South Ireland from the Protestant North.</P>
<P>     Though it takes place in contemporary Ireland, the way in which
people live--many in ramshackle huts with little evidence of modern
"conveniences"--gives the story a timeless quality.  Likewise, the
characters would probably be equally at home in the nineteenth century
as in the twentieth.  Danny and Annagh are both virgins well into their
teens and Danny's father is opposed to any sort of contraceptive.
Religion is a powerful force, and the penalties for premarital sex are
terrible to contemplate.</P>
<P>     The best-crafted element of the film is the love story.  Director
Peter Yates brings real feeling and tenderness to the interactions
between Danny and Annagh, from their first furtive glances at each
other to Danny's faltering attempts to address her in conversation.
Annagh is somewhat more world-wise than Danny, which makes it amusing
to watch her nonplussed reactions to some of his unintentional double
entendres--phrases he innocently thinks have only one meaning.</P>
<P>     The relationship between Danny and his father, although of equal
importance to the romance, is less developed.  Drawn with broad strokes,
this conflict always seems more peripheral than central, which robs a
cathartic scene of emotional power.  Finney does all he can with the
material, creating a mild character always on the brink of an emotional
eruption, but Matthew Keeslar can't keep up with him.  In fact, Keeslar,
who is at times flat, isn't the equal of any of his co-stars.  Both
Victoria Smurfit and Anthony Brophy have impressive debuts.</P>
<P>     The script, adapted by Shane Connaughton (the writer of MY LEFT
FOOT) from his own book, has a fair number of affecting sequences, and
manages to deftly mix humor and serious issues.  While the political
situation and the possible involvement of the IRA are kept in the
background, they are not ignored.  Part of growing up in Ireland, after
all, is coming to grips with this volatile element of life.  At one
point, Prunty advises:  "Have a dream ya can live for, lad, not one
that'll put you in the grave."  More crucial to the story, however, are
the boundaries created by religion, education, and class.  Every
conflict in this film has its roots in one of these three causes.  So,
although THE RUN OF THE COUNTRY has its weak spots, it nevertheless
gives us a more original coming-of-age story than that which typically
graces American screens.</P>
