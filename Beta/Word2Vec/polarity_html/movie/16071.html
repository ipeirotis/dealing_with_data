<P>Bill Condon's "Gods and Monsters" is a fascinating look into the last 
days in the life of gay director James Whale (Ian McKellan), who made 
the horror classics "Frankenstein" and "Bride of Frankenstein." Since I 
was unfamiliar of Whale prior to viewing the film, there is no way to 
know how accurate the film is, but I suspect that much of it only came 
from Whale's inner fantasies and hallucinations. </P>
<P>Whale, who fought in WWI and then went on to become known for his work 
on horror pictures, decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to 
quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him. As 
the film tells it, during the end of his life, Whale, at his large home 
in L.A., became infatuated with the tall, handsome, and much younger 
man, Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser), who was working as the gardener at 
his home. James Whale, we learn quickly was, what many people refer to 
him as in the film, "a dirty old man." In one of the opening scenes, a 
young film enthusiast visits Whale's home to interview him and Whale 
agrees, on one condition: for every question he answers, the young man 
must take off an article of clothing. Because of this episode, we know 
exactly what it is Whale wants when he asks Clayton to pose for him for 
a painting, later making the excuse that his bright, white shirt is 
disracting only so he will take it off. Clayon agrees, and doesn't 
really think much of this, much to the warnings of his friends, becoming 
more and more intrigued in the stories Whale tells him about his past. 
Certainly, the relationship between Whale and Boone is headed for a 
downfall, since Whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man, 
even though Boone is not gay, and Whale himself realizes he is nearing 
the conclusion to his life, as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes 
and moments of true catharsis.</P>
<P>"Gods and Monsters" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of 
a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast, due to his 
sexual preference, and never got the recognition he would have liked, 
since he longed to be referred to as a "motion picture director," rather 
than a "horror director." And in one heartbreaking scene, he attends a 
party with Boone being his guest, held by director George Cuckor, and 
finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore. It 
is evident that Whale's first love in his life was making movies, and 
when his career ultimately fell apart, so did his passion in life. </P>
<P>As played brilliantly by Ian McKellen, James Whale comes off as a sad, 
but dignified man, and a person who was not afraid to stand out from 
others, just as long as he knew he was being true to himself. He never 
hid the fact that he was gay, however, even if it meant threatening his 
filmmaking profession, and it was this unblinking honesty that made him 
a great person. Through the complicated relationship that develops 
between Whale and Boone, Boone, of course, only things of Whale as a 
possible friend or someone he can talk to, while it means so much more 
to Whale, who sees Boone as sort of his salvation in life. Although 
Boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people's homes, Whale 
views him as the ideal man, not only one that is good-looking, even 
though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings, but one 
that will actually listen to him. Since Whale lives with only his loyal, 
but disapproving maid (touchingly portrayed by Lynn Redgrave), it is 
Boone that Whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world, 
and the only reason Whale finally decides to attend the gathering of 
George Cuckor.</P>
<P>Although an extremely fine and mature picture, a few small elements hold 
the film back from ultimate greatness. It is appreciated that the film 
does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments, but 
it is a little thin, and the structuring of the "on-again-off-again" 
friendship at the film's center is fairly predictable. We know early on 
where these two characters are headed, and we can guess that there will 
be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds. 
In lesser hands, this set-up might have felt too calculated, but it is 
not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film 
to be much more than this. Also, a subplot is briefly brought up between 
Clayton and a waitress working at a bar (effectively played by Lolita 
Davidovich), but abruptly dropped and never brought up again. If the 
film was not going to follow up on this side story, then it, perhaps, 
should have been taken out altogether.</P>
<P>"Gods and Monsters" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture, 
impressively directed by Bill Condon, who, I sense, relates to or fully 
understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between Whale 
and Boone. The film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an 
untimely end. Walking away from "Gods and Monsters," it was Ian 
McKellen's marvelous and astounding performance that left the most 
impression on me, and I doubt there could have been anyone who could 
have stepped into the role more fully and believably. It is a sad 
testament when a person's true talent and love is unfairly taken away 
from them, based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal 
life, which, ironically enough, is no one else's business in the first 
place. </P>
