<P>     The first thing to note about WAITING TO EXHALE, Forest Whitaker's 
theatrical feature debut as a director, is that it will likely be a huge 
success with its target audience.  Many black women will see themselves 
in this motion picture, and, subconsciously using their personal 
background to fill in gaps left by the screenplay, they will declare 
this film a triumph.  I wish I could be as positive with my opinion, but 
I found WAITING TO EXHALE to be seriously flawed -- a string of 
connected vignettes that propel the four main characters along easily 
predicted character arcs.</P>
<P>     Of the quartet of stories, Bernadine's is the most compelling.  
It's no coincidence that this character is played by Angela Bassett, the 
best actress in the cast.  Bernadine has been dumped by her husband of 
eleven years (Michael Beach), a rather slimy fellow who has left her 
with their two children so he can move in with his white mistress.  
Needless to say, Bernadine doesn't react well to this news and her 
response -- torching his car with all his possessions in it -- will 
almost certainly garner loud cheers from women in the audience.</P>
<P>     Although not as interesting as Bernadine, Loretta Devine's Gloria 
offers some worthwhile moments.  She's a single mom trying to cope with 
her son's growing need for independence, her ex-husband's confession 
that he's gay, and her own lackluster sexual life.  Fortunately for her, 
a handsome new neighbor (Gregory Hines) moves in, and he seems to have 
all the answers.</P>
<P>     WAITING TO EXHALE's other two characters -- Savannah (Whitney 
Houston) and Robin (Lela Rochon) -- are basically separate aspects of 
the same personality.  Both are stuck in bad relationships that they are 
unable or unwilling to escape from.  Neither of these stories is of more 
than passing interest, and the movie slows to a crawl when Houston or 
Rochon takes center stage.</P>
<P>     Whitaker's direction, like the tone, is uneven.  Some of the 
switches from comedy to drama are forced and abrupt.  That said, 
however, WAITING TO EXHALE contains a fair number of genuinely humorous 
sequences, many of which make pointed comments about male insensitivity.  
There are also several memorable serious scenes, the best of which team 
Angela Bassett with Wesley Snipes.  Not only does this pair sizzle, but 
the dialogue is intelligently-written and the performances are on-
target.  </P>
<P>     The most significant fault in WAITING TO EXHALE is its character 
presentation.  With the exception of Bernadine, I never felt anything 
for the women populating this film, as they failed to capture my 
interest or sympathy.  Part of this can be attributed to bland 
performances by Houston and Rochon, but the script must bear an equal 
share of the burden.</P>
<P>     No doubt about it -- this is a "women's movie" (or, as it's 
alternatively referred to, a "chick flick"), but it's among the year's 
weakest.  HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT and MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO 
covered comparable ground earlier in 1995, and there are similarities 
between WAITING TO EXHALE and THE JOY LUCK CLUB (especially since co-
writer Ronald Bass was involved in the book-to-screen transition of Amy 
Tan's novel).  Of all those films, however, this one has the most 
artificial and disjointed "feel".  Personally, I don't buy the "male 
bashing" accusation that has been leveled at WAITING TO EXHALE.  The 
treatment of men in the movie seems fine, and there are other problems 
more worthy of attention.  Given the dearth of significant roles for 
black women in motion pictures, it's refreshing to see these four 
bonding on the big screen -- and that's almost reason enough for this 
film to have been made.  Nevertheless, it's difficult to deny that 
another layer of substance is needed to lift the movie about this 
superficial level of melodrama.</P>
