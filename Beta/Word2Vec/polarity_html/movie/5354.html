<PRE>                ONCE UPON A TIME ... WHEN WE WERE COLORED
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     ONCE UPON A TIME ... WHEN WE WERE COLORED is based on the best
selling memoirs of Clifton Taulbert.  It tells of a time and a people
in the south that is rarely dealt with on film.  It starts in Colored
Town  which is the name of the black community on the wrong side of the
railroad tracks in Glen Allan, Mississippi.  The film starts in the
year is 1946 when segregation is in full force.</P>
<P>     Wait a minute, you are probably saying.  I have seen a lot of
movies about racial discrimination in the south.  As you start to tick
off the movies (MISSISSIPPI BURNING, etc.), ask yourself how many of
these focus on the black community itself.  If you examine most of the
films, you will see that they are more about whites and what bad things
the whites do to the blacks.  You see a lot of blacks as victims, but
rarely do you see the blacks coming together for community, for
support, and for fun as you do in ONCE UPON A TIME ... WHEN WE WERE
COLORED.</P>
<P>     Here the whites appear periodically and serve to remind the
audience of why the blacks suffered.  Even the whites are more
realistically drawn than normal.  You see how uncomfortable some of
them are with the system they feel trapped in, but go along with
anyway.  Other whites rebel and try to help.  All of this
notwithstanding, the whites play a minor role in the picture, which I
found totally refreshing and much more involving.  Other than "Roots,"
which was set in a different era, I do not remember a film that taught
so much of what it is to be part of the black community.  Massive
discrimination is shown certainly, but the great script adaptation
(Paul W. Cooper) keeps the focus on the blacks themselves.</P>
<P>     Like the marvelous film TO LIVE from a couple of years ago, the
show is told in small segments.  It starts when Cliff is born and then
skips to age 5 (Charles Earl Taylor Jr.), 12 (Willis Norwood Jr.), and
finally 16 (Damon Hines).  This means the films spans the turbulent era
of 1946-1962.  Since I was born in 1946 and grew up in the south, the
discrimination presented here from the separate water fountains to the
rest rooms labeled "whites" and "colored," I can remember all too well.
Repugnant as it was, it did happen; I remember. I was there.</P>
<P>     In one of the most poignant, but simple scenes from the show,
Cliff's grandfather "Pappa" (Al Freeman Jr.) asks 5 year old Cliff
several times before they leave to make the big trip to an adjoining
town if he needs to go to the bathroom again, and Cliff says no.  When
Pappa stops for gas, the child announces he has to go, but Pappa shakes
his head pointing out that the service station is small so it just has
a white's restroom.  The child, in pain, must wait until he can go in
the woods later.</P>
<P>     Much of the show is devoted to the milieu of the blacks' lives:
their fishing along the river, their one room school house for all
eight grades, their large picnics, and their worship of God ("If you
call Jesus, his line is never busy").  You relive their smaller
tragedies too as when Joe Louis, "The Brown Bomber", loses the heavy
weight championship after holding the crown for 12 years.</P>
<P>     The blacks are shown as a hopeful lot, and as the narrator (Paul
W. Cooper) says, "Everyone clung to the idea that if you worked hard,
you get a piece of the American dream."  They are also defiant against
injustice, as when one of the women cotton pickers says of the field
boss, "He ain't nothing but a redneck trying to be a white man."</P>
<P>     The only white person that comes off well in the film is Miss
Maybry (Polly Bergen) who gets Cliff books, but warns him, "Books are
like eggs.  You got to crack 'em open to get anything out of them."</P>
<P>     Eventually the seeds of revolution are set.  Even Pappa moves from
passive aggression to active defiance.  As he sums up his anger, "we
got peace with the white man as long as we do what he says."</P>
<P>     The acting is good all round, but the star of the show has to be
Al Freeman Jr. He shows great inner strength, bravery, and
intelligence.  You may remember him from his forceful performance as
Elijah Muhammad in MALCOLM X.  I liked the other actors and actresses,
but none stood out for me the way his performance did.</P>
<P>     The cinematography by John Simmons has the perfect nostalgic sepia
look to it.  The direction by Tim Reid has good pacing except in the
middle where the show loses energy.  Some of the incidents chosen for
illustration work much better than others so, although I really liked
the film, I found it uneven.</P>
<P>     ONCE UPON A TIME ... WHEN WE WERE COLORED runs 1:55.  It is
correctly rated PG.  There is no sex, no nudity, mild violence and only
a few bad words.  It would be fine for any kid old enough to be
interested in the subject.  I liked the show a lot, although I wish it
were more even and had a stronger middle.  I recommend this excellent
show to you and award it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
