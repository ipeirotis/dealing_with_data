<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A "Hollow-wood" production that couldn't be more hollow or Hollywood in
style, and to its only benefit, is visually pleasing. It presents a
classic mysterious aura about it through scenes of thick fog, horrid
decapitations, and framed shots as if it was a period art picture
coming off its frame and onto the screen. But the story, that's a
different story; it is abominable. It is so ridiculous and incredulous
that the filmmaker completely ruins Washington Irving's great short
story. It is not the imaginative parable it was meant to be, but a story
about a serial killer. So, you can forget the book, obviously Tim Burton
did, that is if he ever read it. Here he throws away any imagination
derived from the once (a very long time ago) popular book. In the late
1950s, the story's legend was common knowledge across most of America.</P>
<P>The film is not helped by a cast (I might add a rather talented cast of
British and Americans) that are sleepwalking through their parts. The
two stars, who have inane and unappealing and underwritten roles, and
seem to be acting as if they have no idea of what they are saying or
doing in this film, but seem to enjoy playing it up for the camera,
while showing no chemistry for any romance to be deemed possible between
them; which, without the two stars being credible performers, the film
has little chance of succeeding.</P>
<P>This film has box office appeal as a date movie for the high school set,
comforting each other as they snack on popcorn (which the theater owners
will be largely appreciative of), and the teens, in all probability,
will be reacting with bemused glee or mock horror to all the packets of
ketchup unleashed during the Headless Horseman's romp through the Sleepy
Hollow of 1799. Who else this movie should appeal to, is not for me to
judge. But, when the audience leaves the theater, no harm is done, this
is a totally forgettable film. There is no need to worry about
nightmares over the gratuitous violence seen. This one is so obviously
just a movie, that it can't even begin to match the book for its
eloquence and the great manner of the book's very germane writing style,
that is both lucid and thought provoking. If anything good can be said
about this film, it would be that it brings back to the public's
attention the forgotten writer Washington Irwing, someone who knew how
to craft a ghost story back in the turn-of-the-19th-century and is still
very readable. It's just too bad that a good movie couldn't result from
such an accessible work.</P>
<P>It's best to forget about this movie as in any way connected with the
novel, the only thing  that seems to jive is the time period, the
location, and the character called Ichabod Crane (Depp). But this time
Crane is a constable, leaving NYC on orders from his superiors to hunt
down a serial killer by using his innovative Sherlock Holmes-like
logical detection methods, which are not appreciated by the local police
authorities in NYC. So Crane is not the schoolteacher and choirmaster,
as he was depicted in the book. From here on, the movie is off on its
own tangent, playing havoc with the story. Katrina Van Tassel (Christina
Ricci), the wealthy daughter of the local farmer, will be Crane's love
interest, though she already has a suitor in the brave but chillingly
jealous Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien). In the book, the Headless
Horseman is imaginary. It is Brom, who dresses up as one to frighten the
naive Ichabod away from his rich and attractive woman, and it is the
only way the story can make sense. In the movie the Horseman is real,
and the story becomes a vulgar mystery with some inept attempt to bring
in an air of magical mystery to it, and it almost completely ignores the
romantic rivalry between the two suitors, which was at the heart of
Irving's story.</P>
<P>The town fathers, Reverend Steenwyck (Jones), Magistrate Philipse
(Griffiths), Notary Hardenbrook (Gough), and including the now
wealthiest resident of Sleepy Hollow, Baltus Van Tassel (Michael
Gambon), the father of Katrina, married to her stepmother, Lady Van
Tassel (Miranda). All the town fathers believe the previous 5 murders to
be the work of a legendary Headless Horseman who haunts the area, but
the skeptical Crane scoffs at this. It is only after he sees for himself
that this is true that he decides there is a motive behind these serial
murders, they are not random acts of violence.</P>
<P>Tim Burton ("EDWARD SCISSORHANDS"/" ED WOOD"/"Mars Attacks!"/"Batman")
has succeeded in robbing the story of anything but a cursory look at
Irving's story. How a film could go so far afield, is not unusual for
Hollywood, but in this case the film has gone too far afield from the
story to even claim it is based on the book. Burton has made a story
about a headless horseman who lives inside a tree trunk and is
controlled by a twisted person who uses him to commit murders that will
benefit their cause, but he has miserably failed to capture the
imagination the story requires in its storytelling.</P>
<P>I would suggest reading the short story (about 40-pages) before or after
seeing the film, and then see what you think of the film. I read the
book after the film and am grateful that it called Washington Irving to
my attention, again. Otherwise, I can't say enough bad things about the
film's crass aim to take away the imagination of the story and replace
it with not one shred of what Irving was after in his ghost story about
romantic jealousy but here becoming a story about jejune classical
horror images and a tacked on banal murder story. I'll admit, the movie
looked good, better than most horror movies I might have raved about,
but even with all the gory murders taking place and an excuse for a
who-done-it movie evolving, a tedium set-in and the film seemed to lack
suspense, breath and dimension; and, like a beautiful person without
much else, what else can you say that is complimentary after you say,
you look good!</P>
