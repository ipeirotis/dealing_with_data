<P>     Upon hearing that DIARY OF A SEDUCER was based on a book by noted=20
thinker Soren Kierkegaard, I wondered if I, not being a student of=20
philosophy (and not having read DIARY OF A SEDUCER), might be at a=20
disadvantage.  As it turns out, while writer/director Daniele Dubroux=20
toys with some of Kierkegaard's ideas, this is basically a quirky,=20
lighthearted comedy that isn't remotely interested in deep thought. =20</P>
<P>     The film is structured in an atypical fashion, and it's virtually=20
impossible to predict at the beginning where it's likely to end up. In=20
fact, what opens as a fairly straightforward comedy about the failed=20
exploits of an inept seducer turns into something dark and offbeat, with=20
more than a slight element of magic thrown into the mix.  DIARY OF A=20
SEDUCER is presented in a non-chronological fashion that makes it a=20
little confusing to determine the relationship of certain scenes to=20
others.  In fact, there are times when the movie seems more like a=20
series of loosely-connected episodes strung together than a feature with=20
a central narrative.  The "umbrella story" that binds DIARY's diverse=20
elements is not the film's strongest aspect.</P>
<P>     The central figure is Claire (Chiara Mastroianni), a college=20
student who one day brings home a down-on-his-luck young man named=20
Sebastien (Mathieu Amalric).  Sebastien tells Claire a sad story about=20
being gay and misunderstood, but his real goal is to seduce her.  When=20
his unsubtle attempts to sleep with her fail, he turns his attentions to=20
Claire's mother, Anne (Dubroux), who is both less gullible and more=20
willing than her daughter.</P>
<P>     Initially, it seems that the Claire/Sebastien/Anne triangle is=20
going to provide DIARY's main storyline.  Ultimately, however, it proves=20
to be little more than a minor comic subplot.  The primary narrative=20
involves a magical copy of Kierkegaard's DIARY OF A SEDUCER, which casts=20
a love spell on anyone who reads it.  That person becomes obsessed by=20
the one who gave them the book to read.  So, when a thoughtful, reserved=20
young man named Gregoire (Melvil Poupaud) presents Claire with the=20
volume, she ends up in his thrall.</P>
<P>     Dubroux has populated her film with a wild assortment of oddball=20
characters.  In fact, no one in this film is "normal" by traditional=20
standards.  There's an eccentric party host who waves a gun at his=20
guests, a strange scientist who keeps decaying oxtails in his apartment,=20
and an psychiatrist who ruins his marriage by calmly telling his wife=20
that he's obsessing over a patient.  Even Gregoire, who initially seems=20
almost ordinary, is hiding a startling secret, and it's not just that he=20
shares his residence with an agoraphobic grandmother.=20</P>
<P>     One of the picture's strongest assets is the performance of leading=20
lady Chiara Mastroianni (MA SAISON PREFERE), the daughter of Catherine=20
Deneuve and late actor Marcello Mastroianni.  Talented, attractive, and=20
charming, Mastroianni does much of her acting (and reacting) with facial=20
expressions, some of which are priceless.  Many of the other cast=20
members, including veteran French actor Jean-Pierre Leaud, the=20
delightfully bumbling Mathieu Amalric, and Dubroux herself, perform on=20
an equally high level.  The lone exception is Melvil Poupaud, whose=20
Gregoire is supposed to come across as mysterious and brooding (he is=20
referred to one at least one occasion as "Hamlet"), but instead seems=20
ineffectual.</P>
<P>     I appreciate DIARY OF A SEDUCER for its energy and humor (this is a=20
rare French film that delivers laughs without resorting to the stupidity=20
of movies like THE VISITORS).  There are things here that don't work =96=20
the entire magic book plot strand is poorly developed and ineffectively=20
resolved (the payoff, such as it is, doesn't live up to expectations). =20
But the movie holds the viewer's interest, and, though the final=20
destination reached by DIARY OF A SEDUCER may be something of a=20
disappointment, the journey undertaken to arrive there is enjoyable=20
enough to provide adequate compensation for any eventual shortcomings.</P>
