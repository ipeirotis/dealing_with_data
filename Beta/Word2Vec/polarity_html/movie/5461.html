<PRE>                                 DRUNKEN MASTER II
                                   (TSUI KUN II)
                       A film review by Christopher E. Meadows
                        Copyright 1996 Christopher E. Meadows</PRE>
<P>Directed by Carina Lau; starring Jackie Chan, Anita Mui, Ti Lung</P>
<PRE>Rating: 8/10 (**** out of *****)</PRE>
<P>In the wake of the smashing success of "Rumble in the Bronx," it's
looking more and more likely that more Jackie Chan films will see
American release.  Rumor has it that one of these films will be
Drunken Master II.</P>
<P>The version I have is a copy from the laserdisc; it's widescreen and
bilingually-subtitled, as are most Hong Kong films these days.
Availability over here in the United States is very limited; these
films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from Asian
distributors such as Tai Seng.  The subtitling on the copy I have is
slightly hard to read; the letters are white and a bit small.
Although the American release will almost certainly be dubbed, this
review is of the subtitled version, so please keep that in mind if
you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and
see it.</P>
<P>To be fair, I must admit that I've never been very fond of
"period-piece" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous
China of the distant or not so distant past.  Perhaps it's because
most of those I've seen were filmed on inferior stock, with either
butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling, or perhaps it's
because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and, in
many cases, all but nonexistant.  In fact, many of them get so wrapped
up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely
until only a few minutes before the end.</P>
<P>Or, for that matter, it might be because the Jackie Chan films with
more modern settings (Armour of God, Rumble in the Bronx, etc.) tend
to have more spectacular stunts, often involving large motor vehicles
and large explosions, whereas period pieces simply have the martial
arts.</P>
<P>Having said that, I must now turn right around and say that Drunken
Master II is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above, is
one of the better martial arts films I've seen, and I quite enjoyed
it.  Surprised?  Well, so was I.</P>
<P>Drunken Master II is about a young man named Wong Fei-Hong (played by
Jackie Chan) who is a master of the Drunken Boxing style of Kung Fu.
Where he learned this style is uncertain, as his father, Wong Kei-Ying
(Ti Lung) is steadfast in his opposition to Fei-Hong's practicing it
rather than some more normal style of kung fu.</P>
<P>Apparently, Fei-Hong is some sort of figure from Chinese folklore,
rather like Paul Bunyan is for Americans, but I've heard very little
about this, and could quite well be wrong, so I'll leave analysis of
that to the people who know it better.  One of my friends points out
that the character of Wong Fei-Hong is also featured in the "Once Upon
a Time In China" movies, but I have not yet seen those.</P>
<P>The plot of Drunken Master II is somewhat hazy, as are the plots to
many such films, but if you're watching a Jackie Chan film, odds are
you aren't expecting something on the order of "War and Peace".  The
story seems to revolve around Those Evil Foreigners who are spiriting
away ancient Chinese relics (and hence, China's cultural heritage)
while overworking, underpaying, and beating up Chinese workers in a
nearby steel mill.</P>
<P>However, this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main
story of the film--Fei-Hong's perpetual struggle to win his
girlfriend, supplicate his father, keep his (pregnant) mother (played
by Anita Mui) from fighting, and keep from getting beaten up by Evil
Foreigner thugs.</P>
<P>The MacGuffin that drives the plot(s) is a precious antique jade
imperial seal which is being taken away by the Evil Foreigners.  In
the beginning, Fei-Hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover
an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father
was bringing back for a customer.  In the process, he clashes with
another thief, who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead
with the ginseng.</P>
<P>After Fei-Hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the
Evil Foreigners' lackies, thanks to some timely intervention by a
general's son (a cameo appearance by Andy Lau, who would later take on
the starring role in Drunken Master III!), comedic chaos ensues back
at the Wong household when Fei-Hong and his mother attempt to come up
with a replacement for the missing ginseng.  And so it goes.</P>
<P>And the plot thickens later on, such as when Fei-Hong's girlfriend
maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival, or when Fei-Hong and
the thief, now revealed to be a loyalist Manchu officer trying to
recover the seal and stop the Evil Foreigners, are attacked en masse
(another grand kung-fu movie tradition), but I think I've already
spent more time on the plot than it really deserves.  Let's move on to
the real draw of Jackie Chan movies...the action.</P>
<P>There's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie...of
course, in a kung fu film, that's to be expected.  However, this isn't
just another kung fu movie; this one has Jackie Chan doing the fight
and stunt choreography, and Jackie Chan is a genius.</P>
<P>The primary martial arts "style" featured in the film is Drunken
Boxing, a form of Kung Fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his
guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk.  Further,
for the purposes of this film at least, Drunken Boxers fight better
when they actually _are_ intoxicated...but there's a fine line between
just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor.</P>
<P>Under normal circumstances, the idea of someone staggering around
looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly
might seem rather stupid, but Jackie pulls it off with flair.  The
kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that
it is pointless to try to describe it on paper, so I'll just say that
the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in
themselves make the movie worth watching.</P>
<P>Another thing Drunken Master II has going for it is the stunt work.
Even without motor vehicles (well, not counting a train), there are
some remarkable stunts in this film.  Among other things, Jackie dives
off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals (not once, but
at _least_ twice, if you count the outtake shown during the credits).
(Quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the WWW movie
database.)  Unlike in American films, these stunts are _not_ faked.</P>
<P>Drunken Master II stars several veteran actors of the Hong Kong movie
scene, including Jackie, Ti Lung ("A Better Tomorrow" 1 & 2), and
Anita Mui (the "Heroic Trio" series, "Rumble in the Bronx").  The
performances are first-rate, especially when it comes to the comedy
parts of the film.  The scene where Fei-Hong and his mother conspire
literally behind Fei-Hong's father's back to cover up for the missing
ginseng root is hilarious, as is the scene where Fei-Hong's mother,
having just revealed that she is pregnant, is threatening to hurt
herself (in order to draw her husband's anger away from Fei-Hong).
Jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of
mastery over the years, and he's in fine form all through Drunken
Master II.</P>
<P>As far as cinematography is concerned, it certainly works for this
film.  It's nothing spectacular, but is at least a dozen times better
than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s.  The picture is crisp
and clear.  One thing I find particularly worthy of mention is that,
at least in the copy I have, the screen was wider than any film I've
ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was
blocked out above and below.  (Watch this on a bigscreen TV or movie
theater if you can.)  It will be an utter shame if this film is
eventually pan-and-scanned for American video release.</P>
<P>Drunken Master II shows the full potential of "period piece" kung fu
movies, and it's good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for
such movies.  The plot does meander a bit, but that's to be expected
in this type of film.  If you like this kind of movie, you'll love
this movie, and if not, well, give it a chance anyway.  If nothing
else, the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the
price of admission or rental.</P>
