<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Set in the French Riviera, this erotic thriller directed by Dominique
Deruddere (Crazy Love/Wait Until Spring Bandini), is a story about whose
got control: a virile, not too bright, arrogant, handsome young hustler
on the run, Chris (Kamerling); or, a very wealthy, crafty, older
impotent invalid, ex-playboy Glover (Postlethwaite), who is in a wheel
chair and living in a ritzy hotel with nothing but time on his hands.
Into his suite 16 stumbles the dazed Chris, bleeding profusely from his
head wound, suffered when his gigolo robbery took a bad turn. Chris
believes he might have murdered the older woman with the pooch, whom he
enticed while hanging out in the hotel lobby to take him up to her room
for sex, but when she refused to be robbed that easily and conked him on
the noggin, he threw her against the wall, thinking he killed her.</P>
<P>The ego-maniacal Glover has grown lonely and twisted inside, and
strangely enough is not frightened of the young murderer on the run, who
holds him hostage. Instead he makes him an offer he can't very well
refuse, stay with me and I'll give you everything you want. Chris' needs
are material things such as clothes, beer, food, cocaine, and women. In
return, Glover receives a vicarious thrill watching him on a hidden
video camera while Chris makes it with the prostitutes he supplies him.
It all turns out to be a tedious game to see who is in control: brains
or brawn. The kid plays his part like he's a lump of coal and the sex is
so uninviting, making it seem just as boring as watching paint dry on a
wall.</P>
<P>Glover's servant, Paul (Jansen), serves as the intermediary, looking out
for Glover and carrying out all his orders. And like all the characters
in this film, is not developed. There is no rhyme or reason for all this
sleaze to be taking place, except for making the audience into voyeurs,
like the invalid.</P>
<P>What is quickly resolved, is that Glover isn't queer, just manipulaive
and mentally sick. It is also determined that Chris is a misfit, unable
to accomplish even his mundane aim in life to become rich and live in
the Caribbean. That he is a failure in everything he does, even as a
hustler, blaming all his misfortune on a poor-upbringing, is never
followed through storywise. That explanation of him doesn't ring true,
anyway, as he always has a blank and uninteresting look on his face, and
nothing he does throughout the film is taking him to anything but a
dead-end. So it becomes hard to feel anything for him, but pity and
contempt.</P>
<P>The film hit a dry spot for a long while, until a pretty school-age
working girl, Helen (Geraldine Pailhas), enters the picture and the
threesome play off each other's flaws. She livens things up a bit,
brought into the picture because Glover has upped the ante, he now wants
Chris to pick out a woman in the street and murder her, and she's the
one he picks.</P>
<P>Chris doesn't have it in him to be a cold-blooded murderer, so he
pretends to be killing her so he can collect the huge sum of money
offered him to do the job. Glover is disappointed in the young man and
ends up inviting Helen back to the suite for some more fun (sic) and
games. The sadistic games are better delivered now with the presence of
Helen, but the menage a trois doesn't have the nuances, wit, or actors
to pull off the macabre effects it was trying desperately to get away
with. And the new rivalry between the girl and boy, never amounts to
much of a story.</P>
<P>The film tries to build to a powerful climax. It becomes obvious that
Glover has a death-wish and has been preparing all-the-time for this and
now seems ready, as he reads from a poem by a zen monk who is about to
die, which goes something like this-- "In all my 56-years alive, I've
seen no miracles. It is okay to die today. Day after Day does not the
sun rise in the east?"</P>
<P>But even that attempt to get some life into the story fizzled, as the
film just wound down trying to outsmart itself with shockers to its
denouement, but ended up not being a very thrilling thriller or even
living up to its reputation of being a controversial film. It was just a
dull, exploitive movie, distinguished only by the fine performance of a
good actor, Pete Postlethwaite, who was overwhelmed by being in such a
trying film.</P>
