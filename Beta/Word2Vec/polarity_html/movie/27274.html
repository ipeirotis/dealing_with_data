<P>     In an early scene in THIRTEEN DAYS, Kenny O' Donnell (Kevin Costner)
sits at the breakfast table with his wife and children. It is October
1962, and O'Donnell is a special advisor to President John F. Kennedy
(Bruce Greenwood). As the conversation turns to field trips and report
cards, alarm bells begin going off. Not literal alarm bells for some civil
defense drill -- metaphorical, artistic alarm bells for viewers with a
sense of deja vu. This is a film about the Cuban Missile Crisis, but here
we are with a crew-cut Costner in his domestic glory. Will THIRTEEN DAYS,
like JFK before it, make the mistake of looking at a pivotal moment in
American history and asking, "How did it affect Kevin Costner's fictional
family?"</P>
<P>     Then, for most of the film, something wonderful happens: We see no
one but men in suits, trying to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem. As
tautly directed by Roger Donaldson, THIRTEEN DAYS finds riveting drama in
passionate debate, tricky politics and impossible decisions -- at least
until the O'Donnell kin start turning up again. Most of the narrative is
spent in the war rooms and strategy sessions that find JFK and his key
advisors -- O'Donnell, his brother and Attorney General Bobby (Steven
Culp), Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker) -- trying to
determine the appropriate course of action after spy planes identify
Soviet nuclear missile sites under construction in Cuba, just a couple of
weeks away from being functional. Do nothing, and doomsday is a five
minutes flight from half of America. Try diplomacy, and the sites become
operational while offers and counter-offers take place. Sneak in to
attack the sites, and the Soviets retaliate in Europe, setting off a
likely World War III.</P>
<P>     THIRTEEN DAYS is a history-based thriller that faces a variation on
the knuckle-headed joke promulgated by the anti-TITANIC contingent: In
this case, we know the boat (or the human race) _doesn't_ sink. But
THIRTEEN DAYS isn't about whether or not the world will be bombed to
cinders; it's about the astonishing real-life war game played by capable
but flawed people for the fate of civilization. For a film that is devoted
largely to debate and description of scenarios, THIRTEEN DAY is incredibly
tense. We watch politicians go toe-to-toe with soldiers over the
appropriate philosophical footing for dealing with the Red Menace. We
watch brinksmanship played like two kids shoving each other on a
schoolyard. It's the kind of smart film-making of ideas that can keep you
on the edge of your seat waiting for a phone to ring, or not to ring.</P>
<P>     Mostly, however, it's a profile in the courage under fire of John F.
Kennedy. Plenty of films have opted either to canonize JFK as our great
slain king or demonize him as a womanizing rich kid, but I don't think any
film has ever made him as compelling a dramatic character. As played with
a piercing intellect by Bruce Greenwood, Kennedy is portrayed as an often
short-tempered man with burdens to bear (the subtle acknowledgement of his
chronic back pain is one of many effective shorthands in David Self's
script). He's also the essence of a great leader, bringing the finest
minds together, considering the greatest possible good and finally
trusting his own reason and judgment. Greenwood's dynamic performance
finds JFK's legacy not in some legend of golden boy heroism, but in the
idea that he carried out his responsibilities with character.</P>
<P>     All is exceedingly well in THIRTEEN DAYS until the story begins
drifting back to O'Donnell fretting over his loved ones. Costner is a
much-maligned dramatic actor, and he doesn't do himself favors here with a
honking Boston accent that's borderline absurd next to the subtler
intonations of Greenwood and Culp (as scary a dead ringer for RFK as you
could imagine). When one scene after another in the final half hour of
THIRTEEN DAYS finds Costner staring pensively at one of his children,
sharing a quiet moment with his wife or rubbing his tightly-closed eyes,
it becomes too easy to lose focus on the big picture for some misguided
sense of "humanizing" the story. There are plenty of dramatically
fascinating humans in THIRTEEN DAYS without ever leaving the closed
conference rooms of the White House and the Pentagon. Policy can make
surprisingly intense cinema, without a breakfast table or report card in
sight.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 hits and missiles:  8.</PRE>
