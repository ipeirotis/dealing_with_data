<P>     The success of Jane Austen on the silver screen has led to a sudden 
outpouring of movies based on classic literature.  The flood, which has 
already started, will include new features from the works of William 
Shakespeare, Henry James, Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, and Henry 
James.  Suddenly, all the novels we were forced to read in high school 
and college English classes are being filmed.  And, if you ignore last 
year's ignoble THE SCARLET LETTER, not one (thus far) has been botched 
up.</P>
<P>     THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY, the first motion picture adaptation of 
James' beloved classic, presents a stark contrast to the light-and-sunny 
Austen movies.  Although it examines some of the same issues as PRIDE 
AND PREJUDICE, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and EMMA, the perspective is much 
darker (although not, it should be pointed out, as dark as that chosen 
by Hardy).  Those expecting a light romance from THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY 
are in for a rude awakening.  </P>
<P>     Even though THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY deals with characters and 
situations in late nineteenth century Europe, its relevance for today's 
audiences is undeniable.  Social standards and practices have changed 
dramatically in the last one-hundred years, but human nature remains 
immutable.  Actually, director Jane Campion (THE PIANO) is a little too 
obvious about connecting this 1881 story with the 1990s.  She opens the 
film with a brief montage featuring contemporary, young Australian women 
ruminating about kissing, love, and intimacy, then abruptly shifts to a 
close-up of Nicole Kidman's face.</P>
<P>     Kidman, an Australian-born actress using a passable American 
accent, plays Isabel Archer, a headstrong-but-naive young woman who, as 
the story opens in 1872, has recently arrived in England from America.  
While there, she's staying at the estate of her aunt (Shelly Winters) 
and uncle (John Gielgud).  Her closest companion and confidante is her 
cousin, Ralph Touchett (Martin Donovan), a consumptive who encourages 
his father to will a large sum of money to Isabel.  She is also pursued 
by two suitors:  the rich and unexciting Lord Warburton (Richard E. 
Grant) and the dashing Caspar Goodwood (Viggo Mortensen).  She rejects 
both, saying "I don't want to be a mere sheep in the flock.  I shall 
probably never marry."  Her desire is to explore the world and forge her 
own way in it.</P>
<P>     When her uncle dies, leaving her a fortune of 70,000 pounds, she 
has the financial means to do so.  She begins to travel, spending a 
great deal of time in Italy.  But her naivete enables her to be led 
astray by the sinister Madame Serena Merle (Barbara Hershey), whom she 
falsely believes to be her friend.  Madame Merle contrives a meeting 
between Isabel and the dangerous Gilbert Osmond (John Malkovich).  Soon, 
Isabel, seduced by Osmond's promises of love, agrees to marry him, 
believing that she will have the upper hand in their union.  Too late, 
she recognizes Osmond's true nature.</P>
<P>     Those familiar with Jane Campion's previous effort, THE PIANO, will 
not be surprised by the dismal tone of THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY, which, if 
anything, is even more grim than that of the novel.  Campion films over 
half of the scenes in dim light, making effective use of contrast to 
highlight character attributes.  Isabel is frequently shown standing in 
patches of light while Madame Merle and Osmond keep to the shadows.  
Occasionally, Campion gets a little too artsy, as in a surreal, black-
and-white dream sequence where Isabel's subconscious wrestles with 
Osmond's declaration of love. </P>
<P>     There are problems with PORTRAIT's structure and pace, which could 
easily be the result of trying to condense a 600+ page book into a one-
hundred forty-five minute movie.  A great deal of background is omitted, 
which makes the beginning of the film erratic and, at times, almost 
incoherent.  The first third -- that portion which occurs before Osmond 
makes his initial appearance -- is rather dull and uninvolving.  
Isabel's character doesn't really start developing until Osmond comes on 
the scene.  Up to that point, she's just an independent 23-year old with 
insatiable curiosity but not much personality.  Later, especially as the 
movie builds to an emotionally-wrenching climax, we are drawn into 
Isabel's world.</P>
<P>     As has been the case in almost every period drama released in 1996, 
the acting is impeccable.  Nicole Kidman impresses as Isabel, especially 
in the late scenes.  We see the character's once-steadfast resolve 
crumble then attempt to re-assert itself as she faces her physically and 
psychologically abusive husband and learns the secret shrouding the 
identity of his lone daughter (Valentina Cervi).  Since Campion has a 
great love of close-ups, Kidman's face and eyes enhance her performance.</P>
<P>     John Malkovich is at his creepy best, playing Osmond as a vicious, 
malignant Svengali.  This kind of villain is far more interesting than 
the ranting psychopaths who populate films with less ambition.  Osmond 
is truly frightening, and a great deal of credit goes to Malkovich.  
Watching this performance, it's easy to understand how Isabel became 
trapped in such a relationship.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast is solid, and includes Martin Donovan (FLIRT) 
as Isabel's one true love, Viggo Mortensen (DAYLIGHT) and Richard E. 
Grant (TWELFTH NIGHT) as her disappointed suitors, Valentina Cervi as 
her step-daughter, Barbara Hershey as the duplicitous Madame Merle, and 
Mary-Louise Parker (BOYS ON THE SIDE) as Henrietta Stackpole, Isabel's 
female compatriot.  The settings and period detail are attended to with 
particular care.</P>
<P>     THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY is a difficult story to film, and Jane 
Campion and screenwriter Laura Jones have done an admirable job with 
this adaptation.  The motifs of love, betrayal, and accepting the 
consequences of one's actions are well-established.  The movie does not 
attain the emotional depth of Michael Winterbottom's recent JUDE, but 
there are definite thematic and tonal similarities.  The result is a 
fascinating portrait not only of a lady, but of the society and marriage 
that entrap, then attempt to destroy, her.</P>
