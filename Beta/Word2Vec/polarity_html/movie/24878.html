SMALL TIME CROOKS</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * *</PRE>
<PRE>Directed by: Woody Allen
Written by: Woody Allen</PRE>
<P>Ray Winkler (Woody Allen) is an ex-con who now works a menial job and
dreams of a better life. His latest lame-brain idea is to rent space
in a store across from a bank and tunnel under the street into the
bank's vault.  Ray brings three friends, Denny (Michael Rapaport),
Tommy (Tony Darrow), and Benny (Jon Lovitz), into his scheme to help
him dig the tunnel. His wife, Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), and her brain
dead cousin, May (Elaine May), work a cookie shop in the space they
have rented to hide Ray's activities. The plan doesn't work quite the
way Ray intended. In fact, it doesn't work at all.  The group has been
so busy tunnelling they haven't noticed what a hit Frenchy's cookies
are, and they decide to turn the little store into a huge
franchise. Ray and Frenchy are now rich beyond their wildest dreams,
but it affects them in two very different ways. Ray somehow turns into
even more of a slob, wanting nothing to do with a rich
lifestyle. Frenchy has become so completely infatuated with her new
way of life that she hires an art dealer, named David (Hugh Grant), to
teach her how to act like her new wealthy friends. Soon Ray and
Frenchy are drifting down very different paths, and Frenchy starts to
think she may have outgrown Ray.</P>
<P>Let me start by saying that I have never cared for Woody Allen's
films, thus my opinion of this movie may be a tad biased. I've never
understood Allen's humor - like when Frenchy says something sarcastic
to Ray, and he responds with "I'm this close to popping ya Frenchy,
just one more word." It wasn't funny back when Jackie Gleason said
something similar, and it's somehow even less funny when Allen says it
now.  The only funny thing about it is that I think Tracey Ullman
could probably beat Allen up. I will say this, "Small Time Crooks"
actually starts off rather funny, with Ullman given a few amusing,
witty comebacks to some of Allen's dumber statements. In fact, the
first third or so of the film is really quite funny. Watching the four
bumbling criminals try to carry out their plan is uproariously funny
at times, especially when they break a pipe in the wall and flood the
entire store. Unfortunately, once they make their fortunes, and the
whole rags-to-riches story takes over, all the humor is sapped out of
the movie. I suppose Allen was trying to show the benefits of a simple
life compared to an extravagant one; but if that's the case, he failed
miserably. Both lifestyles looked pretty horrendous.</P>
<P>Woody Allen has always seemed to be one of the more irritating actors
in Hollywood. I think his stuttering over every word and bumbling
around like a buffoon is supposed to be funny, but here's the fact of
the matter: Woody Allen is too smart to play a stupid character. I've
seen him in interviews, and the man is too intelligent to convincingly
play a bumbling idiot.  This may be why he has surrounded himself by
characters even dumber than Ray.  Michael Rapaport ("True Romance") is
notorious for playing brainless characters, and he plays more of the
same here. Jon Lovitz ("Trapped in Paradise") is infamous for playing
irritating characters, and Benny probably would have been fairly
annoying if given more screen time. Actually, nearly the entire
supporting cast is stupid (I mean that in an unfunny way), irritating,
or both. The only exceptions are Tracey Ullman, in the film's first
half, and Elaine May (you remember, she wrote and directed "Ishtar"
way back when) as the hilariously dense May. If it hadn't been for
Elaine May's presence, I probably would have rated this film quite a
bit lower.  She is so likeable and naive that she can't help but make
the movie at least somewhat enjoyable. Last, we have Hugh Grant
("Mickey Blue Eyes"), who serves no purpose and seems to realize this
judging by the performance he gives.</P>
<P>The thing which most bothered me about "Small Time Crooks" was that
Allen leaves a dozen or so loose ends. Characters vanish half way
through the film and are never heard from again; romantic angles arise
but are never dealt with; and the ending doesn't tie things up quite
the way I would have liked.  There are numerous other faults, though
they are fairly minor. There isn't much of a soundtrack; some of the
scenes feel rushed (the first dinner party and the aftermath of the
cookie company being created), while others seem to drag on forever
(any scene with Hugh Grant); and the comic pacing is non-existent at
the film's midpoint. The film's high points are Elaine May, Ullman's
occasional smart-alec comments, and the attempted bank robbery.
"Small Time Crooks" does run an admirable 94 minutes at a time when
films running less than two hours are becoming a rare breed. Fans of
the old Woody Allen films will probably enjoy it because he's back to
his screw-ball antics rather than the dramatic pictures of the last
few years. If, like me, you don't care for Allen's brand of humor, I'd
suggest you skip this one. I give it three out of five stars.</P>
