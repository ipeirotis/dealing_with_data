<P>One of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable.  You know, the one
where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information, and suddenly spots the clue
which reveals who the killer is.  Sure, it's been used over and over, but for some reason, it is always fun to
watch.  This cliche pretty much describes the level KISS THE GIRLS works on: overused, but always fun.  One of
my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is, but how it goes around giving its
story.  This rule applies highly to KISS THE GIRLS.</P>
<P>There is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie, and KISS THE GIRLS is
certainly well made.  However, the whole film screams of unoriginality, and so it relies on the power of its
actors and the technical detail to pull it through.  Well, not only are the actors capable of pulling it
through, but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up.  Unfortunately, one of the
most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers (one that SEVEN, a film a lot like this one,
knew not to make) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits.  That may give the actor credit
for the role, but throughout the film, hidden in my mind, I was waiting for him to appear on screen, which
spoiled the mystery.  However, credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most
of the film.  </P>
<P>Plotwise, KISS THE GIRLS shows almost no originality.  We are introduced to Detective Alex Cross (Morgan
Freeman), a forensic psychologist, and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the
hero.  He gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself.
Obviously Cross succeeds at getting the gun, but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene.  At
his house, Cross is told that his neice, Naomi (Gina Ravera), has been missing for four days.  This provides
the motivation for Cross to find the killer, but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship
between the two, and as a result, we can't sympathize with Detective Cross.  However, what makes KISS THE
GIRLS slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees... before she is abducted.  Dr. Kate
McTiernan (Ashley Judd, the actress of the Judd family) is a smart, athletic woman, and because of these
traits, becomes a target for Casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself.  Because of these
character-developing scenes, we care for McTiernan, making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful. </P>
<P>After being abducted, McTiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods.  Remembering that
the killer gave her certain rules, she decides to break one of them by calling out.  When Casanova comes to
punish her, she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall.  After she is found, she begins to help
Cross find his neice.  From this moment on, KISS THE GIRLS takes on the form of every other serial killer
film, as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive. </P>
<P>Many people will compare this film to 1995's SEVEN, another killer film starring Morgan Freeman, but I presume
that the similarities are intentional.  The screenplay, by David Klass, is adapted from the novel written by
James Patterson, and yet I don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form.  What makes KISS
THE GIRLS so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness.  The cinematography, by Aaron
Schneider, is reminiscient of SEVEN, and sometimes I felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to
impress us.  Sometimes a simple shot is the best one.  However, many of the shots are stunning, and unlike
SEVEN, most of them take place during the day, in sunlight.  The scene when Ashley Judd is running through the
forest is extremely well done, in more than one way.  The camera work is terrific, but the editing makes this
scene work so well.  The chaotic and MTV-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness,
exactly what Judd's character is experiencing. </P>
<P>However, the best aspect of KISS THE GIRLS is its actors.  Morgan Freeman is one of today's most powerful and
believable actors.  Detective Cross is a very good character for him, although it is just a similar one to the
character in SEVEN.  Because of Freeman's powerful presence, he carries half the film by himself.  The other
half is carried by Ashley Judd, one of today's most promising dramatic actresses.  In fact, her performance is
better than Freeman's, if that is even possible.  Her character is more original than Freeman's, and she
handles it wonderfully.  We finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just
scream.  The supporting cast is highly underdeveloped, but the cast members do as much as they can with it.
Cary Elwes portrays a cop in North Carolina, and unfortunately has scraps for a character.  Tony Goldwyn fairs
slightly better, but we don't really get to know his character either.  Gina Ravera gives a good performance,
but again she isn't in many of the scenes.  So as a result of all these small supporting parts, the weight of
the film lies on the two leads, and they do a phenomenal job.  Some of the best acting of this genre, and some
of the best acting of the year.</P>
<P>Two other essential aspects of the film are quite good.  Director Gary Fleder does a good job of controlling
his actors, but the second half of the film loses believability, especially during the revelation of the
killer.  He also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have, losing a lot of
tension during many scenes.  However, to his credit, he does manage a terrific first half.  Part of the blame
falls on David Klass.  I'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more, but Klass focuses on
the two main parts.  While this may give the two leads more screentime, many of the small characters are
one-dimensional, and the killer, when revealed, is extremely implausible.  Thanks to the smart dialogue
adapted from the novel, KISS THE GIRLS always seems intelligent.  None of the conversations are laughable, and
all move the plot forward without seeming forced.  One of the biggest problems I had with the movie was the
motive of the killer.  I blame this mainly on the casting director, because the killer's motive is because of
rejection from women (or so I assume from the opening monologue), but the killer himself is very attractive
(One of my friends is a, shall we say, big admirer of the killer).</P>
<P>KISS THE GIRLS is rated R for terror, violence, language, and suggested sex.  With all the implausibilities of
this film, and with the mediocre second half, KISS THE GIRLS somehow manages to thoroughly entertain.  In
fact, I had the urge to see it again just for the performances.  The cinematography adds a lot of mood to the
already creepy tone, and the script is usually smart.  This is clearly one of those movies which rely on the
acting to pull it through.  Morgan Freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor, and Ashley Judd adds
another notch on her acting belt.  I must also say that I loved the ending.  The showdown between good and
evil was quite tense, and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer.  Perhaps it may not be
possible, but most of the film isn't anyway.  </P>
