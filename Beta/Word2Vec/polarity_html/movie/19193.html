<P>SIGNS OF LIFE (LEBENSZEICHEN) (director: Werner Herzog; cast: Peter
Brogle (Stroszek ), Julio Pinheiro (Gypsy), Wolfgang Reichmann
(Meinhard), Wolfgang Stumpf (Captain), Athina Zacharopoulou (Nora),
Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg (Becker), Achmed Hafiz  (Greek Resident),
Heinz Usener (Doctor), Henry van Lyck (Lieutenant), Florian Fricke
(Pianist), Ger.-1968)</P>
<P>A WW11 German soldier, Stroszek (Brogle), during the occupation of
Greece, towards the end of the war, is wounded 4 weeks after landing
there. While recovering from his wounds in the hospital, the handsome
soldier marries the Greek nurse, Nora (Athina), who was treating him.
His superiors decide to send him to this safe haven, the island of Kos,
where he will rehabilitate in a house they took from a Greek family,
with two other wounded soldiers, Becker (Ungern-Sternberg) and Meinhard
(Reichmann). Becker is a classical scholar and suffers from
constipation, while the belligerent Meinhard is a crane operator in
civilian life. This is Werner Herzog's first feature and is easily his
most conventional story to date; which, nevertheless, results in a
rather interesting drama even if it is a somewhat heavy handed
metaphoric one when it relates the mental breakdown of Stroszek to the
irrationality of war.</P>
<P>There is nothing for the soldiers to do on this barren island, with its
torrid Greek sun bearing down on them, which makes their stay here seem
like an imprisonment. The island is occupied by their forces to guard a
valueless munitions site. The Partisan army doesn't even attack this
island. So the men, stuck here indefinetly, search out things to do so
that they don't go crazy: They paint the house. Meinhard builds a device
to trap the cockroaches that are all around, that he animatedly detests
as useless creatures, deserving their cruel fate.They try their hand
unsuccessfully at raising goats. When one of them finds some gunpowder,
Stroszek teaches them how to make rockets. But he is going off on
lethargic mood swings, where he can't function for long periods at a
time. His marriage seems to be based solely on a physical attraction,
where it is not only the language barrier that keeps him non-communitive
with his wife, there seems to be, also, a total lack of understanding
for each other.</P>
<P>The Gypsy (Pinheiro) is an interesting diversion for the men. He comes
upon their house and tells them he is a king, probably born in Portugal,
who has lost his tribe, and is now in the process of searching the whole
world for his people. He engages them in conversation, shows them a card
trick and blends in with the island's other inhabitants. But the
soldiers don't buy into his story, even though his life story is
probably more real than theirs.</P>
<P>A Turk, who is a Greek resident (Achmed), fully translates for them the
stories they are reading about Kos on the walls of some of the abandoned
castles, which make the claim that the island was once ruled by pirates.
He also complains that he can only pray three times a day instead of the
customary Moslem five, because the people on the island interfere with
his practice.</P>
<P>When a piano player plays Chopin and tells them how Chopin was really
mean in his music contrary to the way most interpret his work, we see
for ourselves how this music seems to have a dizzying affect on
Stroszek, who is beginning to show some serious signs of cracking.</P>
<P>His mental breakdown goes over-the-top when the men go out on a patrol
mission and discover a field of windmills, which the disturbed soldier
starts shooting at. Finally, he goes berserk when back in the house,
grabbing a rifle and shooting at his wife and the two soldiers, chasing
them all the way to town, where he kills a donkey and then proceeds to
take over the munitions site, threatening to blow up everyone on the
island. At last, he is captured, and order is restored to the war
effort.</P>
<P>Herzog's characters exhibited many bizarre touches that made them full
of life, certainly different from any American film about Nazi soldiers.
These soldiers seemed like flawed human beings, trapped by the
environment they were in and their own idiosyncratic nature, all of
which made this ordinary film seem rather special and well-worth taking
note of.</P>
