<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Robert Mitchum is cast as a stable citizen, going against typecast, who
plays the bachelor San Franciscan, Dr. Jeff Cameron. He is burdened with
an unbelievable melodramatic story and the dullish performance of his
femme fatale co-star, Faith Domergue, as the alluring Margo Lannington,
two obstacles that are difficult to overcome. Faith is the gorgeous
protege of studio boss Howard Hughes, and makes her inauspicious film
debut here.</P>
<P>This is a film that is always enticing but could have been much better
served with a different femme fatale playing Faith's part. It was
beautifully photographed by Nick Musuraca in the dark B&W style of noir
and so ably directed by John Farrow, who successfully caught the
nightmarish visions of the tale. It is interesting mostly as a character
study of a capable man blinded by lust whose life is almost destroyed.
Mitchum is the innocent man who is framed and doesn't realize he is
innocent until it is almost too late, recovering in the nick of time
because he has such a strong character and will to live. Mitchum's
convincing portrayal of the innocent man on the run, is what makes the
soap opera story more compelling than it ought to be.</P>
<P>The overworked Dr. Cameron has an unidentified suicide patient thrown on
his lap, whom he treats and finds himself attracted to, and when she
sends him a telegram with her correct address, he pays her a visit and
finds out her name is Margo Lannington. Jeff goes out with her, ignoring
his 'nice girl' nurse girlfriend Julie (O'Sullivan), unaware that Margo
is married to an elderly millionaire, Frederick (Rains), as she tells
him that he's her strict father.</P>
<P>When Margo tells him that she is leaving for a trip to Nassau, Jeff gets
tanked up on some kind of potent Hawaiian drink and goes over to meet
her dad. He finds the truth out and leaves the house upset that Margo
lied to him, but returns when he hears her screams. She claims that
Frederick pulled off her earring, and the jealous husband pushes Jeff to
the floor and Frederick retaliates as he picks up the fireplace poker
and gives Jeff a concussion, before he gets punched out by Jeff. While
Jeff retreats for an ice bag for the victim, Margo suffocates her
husband with a pillow and pins the murder on Jeff. She refuses to allow
Jeff to call the police, saying they will never believe it was an
accident and gets Jeff while he's still in a drunken state to drive with
her to Mexico, all the time fearful that the police are on their trail.
They are so fearful of this, that they fail to get Jeff a prescription
to treat his concussion, and go into a panic about everything they do.</P>
<P>In this l'amour fou tale, Jeff begins to become suspicious of his honey
as he sobers up, remembering the warnings about her state of mind
Frederick mentioned. He will discover in this last dingy border town
they travel to how sick she is, after making their way through bleak
towns in northern and southern California and through dusty roads in
Arizona. They run out of money and have to sell a diamond necklace to
some hustlers, who help them plan their escape across the border.</P>
<P>Spoiler to follow: Proceed to last paragraph if you don't want to know
the ending.</P>
<P>When Jeff refuses to go with her to Mexico after learning that she
killed her husband, she thereby smothers him with a pillow while he is
in his weakened condition because of his concussion, leaving alone for
Mexico. She is surprised when he comes after her and begs him to go
back, but when he continues toward her, she pulls a gun out and starts
wildly shooting at him before the cops at the border kill her, but not
before she proclaims Jeff's innocence.</P>
<P>The movie plays like a noir cliché. But Mitchum saves the day,
realistically showing how a swell guy and such a competent doctor could
be so vulnerable. Claude Rains as always is magnificent, in a small part
but one where his every gesture seems to be constrained in a maniacal
rage ready to burst open. The touch of madness he brings to the film, is
best exemplified by his mischievous smile while meeting his wife's
lover, Mitchum.</P>
