<P>     Even before I was a film critic, I was a studio marketing executive's
worst nightmare.  The standard for selling films has long been to provide
an easy frame of reference for the potential viewer, some comparison to a
well-known and well-liked predecessor to latch on to.  "From the director
of INDEPENDENCE DAY" one ad might trumpet, while another features a
critical comment that the film is "the best romance since GHOST."  Such
tactics have long left me skeptical, fearing yet another bandwagon-riding
copycat rather than looking forward to something with enough substance or
style to stand on its own.</P>
<P>     In my heart, I know PAULIE is an attempt to cash in on the family
film success of recent talking animal pictures like BABE and HOMEWARD
BOUND.  Like BABE, Paulie features a friendly, stubbornly loyal animal as
its protagonist, this one a smart-aleck parrot named Paulie (voice of Jay
Mohr); like HOMEWARD BOUND, it sends the talking animal on a long journey
to find his owner.  If your first instinct is to think of PAULIE as a
dopey rip-off, be prepared for a pleasant surprise. PAULIE may never reach
the enchanting heights of BABE, but it's consistently charming in its own
low-key way.</P>
<P>     PAULIE begins at the ending, in an animal research facility where
gentle immigrant janitor Misha (Tony Shalhoub) is amazed to find a
babbling, mango-loving bird caged in the basement.  Paulie then proceeds
to tell Misha a strange and wondrous flashback tale:  his separation from
Marie (Hallie Kate Eisenberg), the little girl who loves him; a friendship
with a kindly widow (Gena Rowlands); a stint entertaining the customers of
a mobile taco stand owner (Cheech Marin); and eventually a life of crime
assisting a small-time hustler (also played by Jay Mohr).  Though the
adventures are basic and sometimes silly, they are accompanied by lessons
gently taught.  Paulie learns about death, about the consequences of
stealing, about the virtue of politeness, and about the importance of
persistence in pursuing one's dream.  Simple stuff, to be sure, but more
edifying family fare than a dozen recent Disney films put together.</P>
<P>     More generally, PAULIE is a family film which doesn't begin with the
assumption that young audiences respond only to stupidity.  With the
exception of a token instance of flatulence humor and a few coarse
insults, scripter Laurie Craig keeps the gags above the belt, opting to
use animal tricks and verbal sparring for amusement.  Jay Mohr's Paulie is
an obvious hommage to Buddy Hackett (obvious enough that Hackett shows up
in a cameo), but he creates just enough feisty personality to make the
bird's story matter without making him annoying.  PAULIE also features an
unusually strong cast, headed by a grandmotherly Rowlands and the always
appealing Shalhoub (adding a Russian accent to his Nationality of the Week
repertoire).  This is one feature parents and kids will be able to sit
through together with smiles on every face.</P>
<P>     It would be easy to embrace PAULIE excessively simply because it
doesn't crash into a pile of singed green feathers the way you might
expect.  In fact, it's hardly a classic-in-the-making.  The episodic flow
of the narrative sends Paulie jumping to his next new pal just as we've
gotten interested in the last, and takes off on odd tangets involving a
flirtatious female parrot (voiced by Tia Texada, who also plays Mohr's
girlfriend in human form) and tentative swipes at animal testing.  Most
disappointing of all is a conclusion which leaves us with an odd romantic
pairing as its happy ending.  It's an uneven effort, but it's satisfying
to note that it's actually an _effort_.  PAULIE could have cruised along
on talking animals and foolishness; instead, it tells a story of
friendship and good manners with a few sharp jokes.  How nice to find a
fun bit of entertainment, and not just "the best talking animal movie
since BABE."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 PAULIE-glotisms:  6.</PRE>
