<PRE>Rating * out of 5</PRE>
<P>        Sometimes I wonder just what the censors are thinking. Take
this film, "Naked Killer", among it's ingredients are heavy doses of
violence, rape sequences, straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our
system calls "coarse language". But what do those intelligent people
at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get
offended? One word - Penis.</P>
<P>        That's it. In spite of everything else in the movie the one
thing that the censors decide is too much is "Penis.". It really
restores you're faith in the system, huh?  Anyway, that's just a side
point. When Naked Killer was released in the local independent cinemas
around Melbourne, it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip, cool,
controversial thriller. What they forgot to mention was that it isn't
very good.</P>
<P>        The plot involves male cop Tinam (Simon Yam), investigating a
series of brutal murders. While getting a haircut he meets and finds
himself attracted to a girl named Kitty (Chingmy Yau), who, after
extracting revenge on the man who killed her father, falls in with
professional killer Sister Cindy (Svenwara Madoka).</P>
<P>        Realising Kitty has potential, Cindy decides to train Kitty in
several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new
identity. However in the course of his investigation Tinam (Who
believed Kitty had disappeared), runs into her again, but isn't quite
sure if it's her. To complicate matters the actual serial killlers,
Princess and Baby, who a former students of Cindy, and have been told
to kill their old master and her new student. From then the action
ensues...</P>
<P>        All in all, This is not a well done movie. The script is
awful, the direction all over the place, the editing is jerky and
confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor. However the are a
few stand alone pieces that do entertain. The shoot out in the car
park is almost Woo-like in adrenaline. The fight scenes are energetic
and I guess it must get a few points for trying something a little
different.</P>
<P>        Let me put this way, If you like action - get something else,
if you like strong women in movies - get something else, if you have
do decide between this and "Black Cat" for your Hong Kong Female
Action - don't get either.  Even for curiosity value it just isn't
worth it. Let's face it - If ever the was a movie that became popular
on it's subject alone, this is it.</P>
