<PRE>The Art of War
A film review by Max Messier
Copyright 2000 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Wesley Snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles.  Murder at
1600, U.S. Marshals, Money Train, Drop Zone, Boiling Point, and the
ultimate camp film - Passenger 57.  The Art of War is another entry in
this very ugly and unique category.  Ultimately, it is little more than
a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the Warren Report,
ugly violence that would have made Peckinpah cringe, and terrible acting
by B-list actors like Michael Biehn and Anne Archer.  Oddly, it feels
like the undiscovered sequel to another Snipes "masterpiece," Rising
Sun.</P>
<P>The movie revolves around the convenient story of a special UN operative
caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a Chinese ambassador,
the Chinese Triad Brotherhood, a rich Chinese businessman (played
by…that bad guy from Rising Sun, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) a Chinese UN
interpreter, and, inexplicably, Donald Sutherland.  The film ends with
more confusion than a boatload of Chinese immigrants trying to register
at Ellis Island.  Or should I say the film ends with the most blatant
ripoff of both The Matrix and all of John Woo's Hong Kong films
combined.</P>
<P>I am really at a loss to figure out why Wesley Snipes had the gumption
to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers
of the film.  I usually enjoy Snipes' movies - though his dramatic roles
better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his
action films.  Simply, I am amazed by the how inane the script was,
filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences. 
Director Christian Duguay (Screamers) has a strange attraction to the
viciousness of violent acts -- showing splattering brains, people
impaled with broken shards of glass, and lots of gargling and gagging as
blood sprays everywhere.  It also sickens me to know that Oliver Stone,
one of the greatest directors working today, had his hand in producing
this monstrosity.  I guess Snipes sold Stone on the conspiracy angle and
Stone chose not to read the script, watch the dailies, be involved in
casting, or anything else -- or else he'd be filing a court order to
remove his name from the credits.</P>
<P>It's also seems evident that with the Russkies as our new bosom buddies
and the Middle Eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last
couple of years that the new international enemies in Hollywood are the
Communist Chinese.  I'm sure over the next couple of months, even more
"Chinese conspiracy/martial-arts action flicks" are going to be popping
up in your local multiplex.</P>
<P>Hopefully they won't include Wesley Snipes.</P>
