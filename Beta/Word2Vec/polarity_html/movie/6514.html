<P>     Every time I think Hollywood has slipped beyond redemption, someone 
in the system produces a film like JERRY MAGUIRE that renews my faith.  
Apparently, creativity is not dead in the mainstream movie market -- not 
entirely, at least.  This is the kind of movie that reminds me why I 
started reviewing in the first place.  JERRY MAGUIRE is magic on 
celluloid -- fresh, funny, romantic, and upbeat.  You'll leave the 
theater with a smile on your face and perhaps a tear in your eye.</P>
<P>     Personally, I never really bought Tom Cruise as the action lead in 
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.  Here, however, the actor is playing to his 
strength, which lies in an arena that demands less testosterone.  Leave 
the stunts and explosions to Schwarzenegger and Stallone.  Cruise is 
best when he stays low key and flashes the occasional smile.  And, in 
this picture, surrounded by a superlative supporting cast, his ability 
shines.  JERRY MAGUIRE works because we root for the title character, 
and it's Cruise's performance that forges the link between his screen 
personae and the audience.</P>
<P>     As the movie opens, super sports agent Jerry Maguire is facing a 
crisis of conscience (that he still possesses one after working in such 
a cynical, materialistic business is something of a miracle).   He 
wonders what he has become -- "Just another shark in a suit?"  He 
realizes that he hates himself and his place in the world, and laments 
that, although he has a lot to say, no one will listen.  So, late one 
night, he writes a Mission Statement called "The Things We Think and Do 
Not Say: The Future of Our Business".  The essay attacks the sports 
agency business, advocating a more humane approach.  The next day, a 
copy is distributed to everyone in the office.  And, although Jerry's 
co-workers applaud his courage ("Somebody finally said what had to be 
said"), his bosses are offended, and he loses his job.  Only one client, 
unremarkable Arizona Cardinals tight end Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.), 
elects to remain with Jerry as he strikes out on his own.  Also joining 
him is a 26-year old single mother, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), who 
is so moved by Jerry's Mission Statement that she's willing to throw 
away a safe job to be part of his new venture.  </P>
<P>     In an era of downsizing and force reductions, it's easy to 
understand what happens to Jerry.  He speaks his mind, crying out for 
compassion and caring, only to be slapped down.  He is branded as a 
loser because he dares to swim against the heartless, prevalent business 
currents.  Jerry finds himself in deep, uncertain waters, but his 
indefatigable spirit, bolstered by tireless support from Rod and 
Dorothy, helps him navigate the most dangerous eddys.</P>
<P>     JERRY MAGUIRE is about redemption and love.  It's about finding 
one's heart and soul in a business climate that attempts to rip both 
away.  Writer/director Cameron Crowe, who previously helmed SAY ANYTHING 
and SINGLES (in addition to scripting FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH) 
brings both a strong sense of verisimilitude and a lively wit to his 
film.  Even as JERRY MAGUIRE reaches out to the heart, it tickles the 
funny bone.  Not only does Crowe have a knack for creating multi-
dimensional personalities for secondary characters with minimal screen 
time, but he uses traditional formulas in unique ways to serve his 
themes.  For example, a common sports cliche is integrated into JERRY 
MAGUIRE in such a way that it doesn't seem cheap or overdone.  It's not 
the point of the movie; it's just another piece in the overall puzzle.</P>
<P>     Cruise, always a popular box-office draw, shows why he got to the 
top.  With a fine performance, he forms the glue that holds the 
production together.  Of course, it helps that the cast includes three 
stupendous supporting actors, not to mention a child performer (Jonathan 
Lipnicki, playing Dorothy's son) who threatens to steal several scenes 
on cuteness alone.  </P>
<P>     Cuba Gooding Jr., who was excellent years ago in his BOYZ 'N THE 
HOOD debut, but hasn't done much since, invests Rod with a remarkable 
level of energy and enthusiasm.  And, although his favorite phrase is 
"Show me the money!", we recognize quickly that a love of family, not 
greed, is what motivates this athlete.  Regina King (CLOCKERS) is 
wonderful as Rod's fanatically supportive wife.  With a standout 
performance, she transforms what could have been an minor role into 
something noteworthy.</P>
<P>     Then there's Renee Zellweger (THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD), who will 
undoubtedly receive raves for her portrayal of Dorothy, a determined 
woman following her own vision of the yellow brick road.  Zellweger 
displays an appealing blend of strength and vulnerability, and her 
chemistry with Cruise is nearly perfect.  Their first romantic scene is 
charged with a playful, but undeniable, eroticism.  If there's one 
downside to the actress' appearance in JERRY MAGUIRE, it's that she's 
not on screen enough.  And, even if Jerry isn't immediately smitten,  we 
are.</P>
<P>     While the budding romance between Jerry and Dorothy is JERRY 
MAGUIRE's most enchanting element, the remainder of the film has the 
necessary appeal to keep our attention when Zellweger isn't around 
(Cruise, on the other hand, is in just about every scene).  Crowe, who 
doesn't have a subpar entry on his short resume, has crafted another 
winner here.  In fact, with its attention to detail, top-notch 
performances, and universal themes, JERRY MAGUIRE marks his most 
successful movie to date.  For anyone who has forgotten the feelings 
that a wonderful movie can trigger, JERRY MAGUIRE provides a welcome 
reminder.</P>
