<P>     Like last year's atrocious ROOKIE OF THE YEAR, LITTLE BIG LEAGUE
is a boy's fantasy.  At one time or another, almost every baseball
lover dreams about what it would be like to take a turn at bat, manage
from the dugout, or pull the string on a big trade from the front
office.  The unfortunate thing is that too often this sort of fantasy
doesn't make a good drama--passable entertainment, perhaps, but there
isn't enough meat for anything more solid</P>
<P>     Personally, I prefer baseball movies flavored by nostalgia.  Using
real, current major league teams is problematic because it forces a
fanciful film into the realm of reality--not a good place to be for
something like LITTLE BIG LEAGUE.  At least in this case, unlike in
MAJOR LEAGUE 2, today's players aren't snubbed.  There are plenty of
cameos by big-leaguers, including American League All-Stars Ken Griffey
Jr. and Randy Johnson.</P>
<P>     The premise is relatively simple.  Billy Heywood (Luke Edwards) is
one of Minnesota's biggest baseball fans--and why not, since his
grandfather (Jason Robards) owns the Twins.  It comes as something of a
surprise to everyone, however, when, after Granddad's death, the will
reveals that the baseball team has been bequeathed to Billy.  The
eleven-year old takes his new role very seriously--so seriously, in
fact, that when he fires the current manager, he decides to come down
from the front office and manage the Twins himself.  Predictably, the
players are not enthralled about being ordered around by a kid, and
they make their feelings known.</P>
<P>     The most serious failing of LITTLE BIG LEAGUE is the screenplay.
>From beginning to end, the movie feels painfully scripted.  There is
no sense of spontaneity, and none of the actors gives a strong enough
performance to transcend this limitation.  The first half of the motion
picture is especially poor, as characters and situations are introduced
in contrived fashion.  Are we really expected to believe that no one at
a little league game other than Billy knows that three men on one base
means two outs?</P>
<P>     The antiseptic clubhouse atmosphere is not representative of that
of a real baseball team.  Sure, there are the petty jealousies and ego
trips, but none are presented in a convincing fashion.  Without
exception, the players are ciphers with cardboard personalities.  The
lack of salty language is as obvious as the lack of enthusiasm, and
there's far too much culture and civility.</P>
<P>     The interesting thread that flows through the film deals with how
the pressure to win can quell the simple fun and enjoyment of playing
the game.  Billy starts out saying that all he wants is for everyone to
enjoy themselves--don't worry about errors or wins; just give a good
effort.  However, before long, he has become part of the
business--making personnel decisions based on who's more likely to get
the game-winning hit.  The smile and youthful enthusiasm are gone.
Billy is neglecting his friends so he can do paperwork.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the resolution of this situation is simplistic and
disappointing.  Like so much else in this motion picture, it feels
phony--just another easy way out of a tough situation.  Life, even on
the baseball diamond, isn't like that, and for a movie with a lesson to
teach, this sort of facile solution rings false.  The enjoyable
portions of LITTLE BIG LEAGUE can't camouflage the limited quality of
the production.</P>
<P>     The humor is low-key and occasionally effective.  There is a
running gag concerning the proliferation of statistics in the game.
There's also an amusing incident where Billy's mother scolds him for
using foul language in an argument with an umpire.  Unfortunately,
there are too few of these moments.</P>
<P>     Modern-day baseball is a business.  This is something that LITTLE
BIG LEAGUE wants to ignore, to the detriment of its credibility.  Even
players who are on the field because of a love for the game don't act
the way the members of Billy's team do.  This film never believably
captures the sport it portrays, and that leads to a picture that's
closer to a strikeout than a home run.</P>
