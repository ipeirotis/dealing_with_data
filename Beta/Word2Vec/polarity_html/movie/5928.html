<P>"There will be another," the ads for this sequel proclaimed, and why 
not?</P>
<P>True, Brandon Lee is dead, but there would be no reason for him to 
appear in a followup to 1994's The Crow, anyway. The idea of spinning 
artist James O'Barr's original comic book series into a sequel franchise 
revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come 
back from the dead in each movie, taking its own righteous vengeance 
against the world. Given that basic framework, the story could move in 
any number of directions.</P>
<P>Of course, it doesn't. Stubbornly, The Crow: City of Angels backtracks 
to the beginning of the previous film, when Lee's Eric Draven found 
himself drawn back out of his grave to do a Charles Bronson on the thugs 
who tortured him and his girlfriend to death. I remember the first film 
primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality. In flashback, we see the 
most excruciating crimes exacted on Eric and his lover, and then we 
watch in real-time as Eric pays each perpetrator back in kind. It's loud 
and repetitive, true, a sadist's delight -- but it's also horrifying and 
fascinating.</P>
<P>City of Angels gives us more of the same, but less skillfully. There's 
an audience guaranteed for a film like this, although bad reviews and 
poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won't be much of a 
success. In fact, Miramax subsidiary Dimension Films was so fearful of 
the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of 
advance screenings. (I've never understood the reasoning behind this 
tactic, since good notices have never been key to the success of movies 
like The Crow.) So much for any confidence in the worthiness of their 
followup.</P>
<P>This time, Ashe (French-accented actor Vincent Perez) is retrieved from 
his watery death (he and his young son were shackled together, shot, and 
then thrown off a pier) by the crow who serves as his link between the 
worlds of the living and the dead. Perez might have some screen presence 
if he's given something to do with himself, but here he's simply thrown 
in front of the camera as a pretty face. At first, he's shivery and 
frightened, but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and 
becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave. He's befriended by Sarah 
(Mia Kirshner), presumably an older version of the child who narrated 
the first film. Kirshner, so beguiling in Exotica, is here an 
exquisitely photographed blank. Tattooed with angels' wings, Sarah is 
just about as lovely as women come, but she serves no purpose, not even 
as seductress.</P>
<P>The gang of punks who killed Ashe are ostensibly commanded by Judah 
(Richard Brooks), but a far more interesting choice as leader would have 
been Iggy Pop, who plays a gaunt fellow named Curve. Iggy, all bones, 
veins, and drawl, is the only one who seems to have shared in the 
aesthetic of ruin that defines this film. Like all good things here, 
he's dispatched too soon and without much imagination. In the meantime, 
we're subjected to tedious glimpses of Judah's compound, where bondage 
is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in S&M 
fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren't 
distinctly secondhand. Even the soundtrack is tired. More than anything 
I've seen from Hollywood lately, City of Angels smacks baldly of product 
-- it's a movie with a lousy script but a great look.</P>
<P>Critics have been quick to fault the direction of MTV veteran Tim Pope, 
but his work isn't that bad per se. He's got a good eye, and some 
intriguing visual ideas -- if anything, this movie has a few too many 
scenes of ridiculously striking imagery. His major stylistic failing is 
that he can't seem to direct an action scene, and the quick, nonsensical 
cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie. But as 
director, he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that 
wasn't, the performers who couldn't, and an apparent lack of ideas on 
the parts of everyone involved. Who bought David S. Goyer's anemic 
script, anyway? The producers of this Crow were either too dim to 
realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash, or too cynical to 
figure their audience would know the difference.</P>
