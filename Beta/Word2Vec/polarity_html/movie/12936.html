<P>     Perhaps, for the first time in a decade, the pressure is off.  Ever
since THE LITTLE MERMAID re-vitalized Disney's animation efforts in 1989,
the studio's annual animated feature has been one of the year's most
scrutinized releases.  After steadily increasing grosses from BEAUTY AND
THE BEAST and ALADDIN, the stakes were raised even higher when THE LION
KING became a $300 million blockbuster.  Then came POCAHONTAS, THE 
HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and HERCULES, which made "only" $350 million
between them, leading wags to wonder whether the Mouse had lost its touch.
They'd gotten too "politically correct," came the analysis, or too dark.
They'd strayed from the successful formulas which had filled the seats
with youngsters and sent tie-in products scurrying off the shelves.</P>
<P>     Now that no one expects $300 million every time out of the gate,
maybe Disney will get the credit it is due for pushing the limits of 
animated film-making.  MULAN defies convention yet again, bypassing the
well-trodden ground of Western literature and mythology to tell a
2,000-year-old tale from Chinese legend.  The title character (Ming-Na
Wen) is a less-than-demure young girl who seems destined for an uncertain
place in Imperial Chinese society when she fails the tests of the local
matchmaker (Miriam Margolyes). Then the empire is threatened by an
invading Hun army led by Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer), leading the emperor (Pat
Morita) to call on every family to provide one male for military service.
With her aging, lame father Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh) as the only male family
member, Mulan decides to honor her family in a different way by disguising
herself as a man and joining the army.  Accompanied by a disgraced,
redemption-hungry dragon guardian named Mushu (Eddie Murphy), Mulan sets
out to find her destiny in battle, and perhaps fall for her commanding
officer Li Shang (B. D. Wong) along the way.</P>
<P>     The "YENTL goes to China" plot line is basic Disney stuff on a 
certain level -- yearning young protagonist, societal restrictions,
complicated romance, lessons in personal growth and tolerance of
individuality all around.  It's a bit surprising then to find the set-up
as drawn-out as it is in MULAN.  Though there's a bit of comic relief in
the bumbling encounter with the matchmaker, the first half hour is largely
devoted to character development and motivation -- good things on general
principle, of course, but over-indulged here to contribute to an extremely
slow start.  It doesn't help that the early songs by David Zippel and
Matthew Wilder -- yes, the same Matthew Wilder of "Break My Stride" fame
-- are the kind of uninspired post-Howard Ashman ditties which make you
wish someone could get over the Broadway musical paradigm for animated
features.  That opening 25-minute stretch is plenty earnest, but it's
hardly confidence-inspiring.</P>
<P>     When MULAN finally does hit its own stride, beginning with the
visually striking sequence in which Mulan leaves home, it's a solid and
energetic piece of work.  The script incorporates comic relief into its
redemption story much better than POCAHONTAS or HUNCHBACK wedged in its
token gags, providing a fine showcase for Eddie Murphy's fast-talking
dragon and Harvey Fierstein's entertainingly incongruous voicing of a
he-man soldier.  The musical numbers also pick up steam in the second half
of the film, perhaps not providing break-out hummable hits but at least
setting a firm musical tone.  Mostly, however, the film becomes a dazzling
adventure, highlighted by a spectacular battle sequence between Huns and
Chinese soldiers in a snowy mountain pass.  By the time the sharply-paced
climactic confrontation rolls around, with its balanced doses of humor and
suspense, you may have forgotten MULAN's less-than-stellar start.</P>
<P>    I suppose what gives MULAN an added kick are the touches which stray
from familiar Disney patterns.  Notably, the villainous Shan-Yu remains in
the background for most of the film as a mysterious genuine threat -- no
comic sidekicks, no songs, no glib one-liners.  That leaves more time to
develop Mulan's resourcefulness, creating a smart and savvy heroine who
happens to be an Asian woman, a rarity not just in animated films but in
films of any kind.  This may not be the kind of cuddly, inviting film of
which stuffed animal sales and video buying binges are made; indeed, it
may be over the head of kids much younger than 7 or 8.  Fact is, it
doesn't exactly warrant that ubiquitous Disney label of "masterpiece."
Sometimes you're going to take a few false steps when you make a choice
not merely to follow the old steps.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 MULAN ruses:  7.</PRE>
