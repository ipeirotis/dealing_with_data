<P>     The cinematic cynic in me suspects that the lofty, unwieldy title of
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM has as much to do with
timely marketing as it does with a nod to literary fidelity.  After all,
when adults are flocking to the Oscar-winning SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE and
teens are catching "The Taming of the Shrew" turned into 10 THINGS I HATE
ABOUT YOU, the Bard would seem to be riding a unique wave of
cross-demographic hipness.  Then again, Shakespeare has always been
pitched both at the gallery and at the groundlings, mixing the matters of
kings with the matters of clowns.  To that extent, this MIDSUMMER NIGHT is
truly William Shakespeare's in its mix of disparate elements, with all the
delights and potential pitfalls that accompany them.</P>
<P>     Writer/director Michael Hoffman transports the tale from Greece to
19th century Tuscany, where many plotlines swirl around the impending
wedding of Duke Theseus (David Strathairn) and Hippolyta (Sophie Marceau).
Hermia (Anna Friel), the daughter of one of Theseus' courtiers, is
forcefully engaged to marry Demetrius (Christian Bale), but Hermia instead
shares a love with Lysander (Dominic West).  Demetrius, meanwhile, is the
object of affection of Hermia's childhood friend Helena (Calista
Flockhart).  Another thread finds a group of amateur actors, led by the
weaver Nick Bottom (Kevin Kline), preparing a play to be performed for the
Duke's wedding, perhaps to receive an award if it is well-liked.  The
paths of these characters all cross in the nearby forest, where
complications ensue as the machinations of the Fairy King Oberon (Rupert
Everett) and his mischievous servant Puck (Stanley Tucci) -- aided by a
little love potion -- cause every romantic entaglement to become further
entangled.</P>
<P>     At its most basic level, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM is a precursor to
bedroom farce without the slamming doors (doors being hard to come by in
the forest).  As the enchanted lovers become a circle of frustration --
Lysander is made to love Helena, who still loves Demetrius, who still
loves Hermia, who still loves Lysander -- saucy exchanges alternate with
good old-fashioned female mud wrestling.  It takes more than a little
while for the film to find its pacing, hindered by the atypically awkward
work of Strathairn, but once the pleasantly low-tech, stage-set world of
the forest becomes the focus, the high and low comedy both begin working.
The one major hindrance may be the clash of acting styles:  while Bale,
Friel and West go for pure Royal Shakespeare, Flockhart plays Helena as a
neurotic mess fretting over her appearance a la Ally McBeal.  It's an
interesting interpretation, but one that doesn't always mesh with the
other players.</P>
<P>     The other major sub-plot becomes both A MIDSUMMER NIGHT DREAM's high
point and its source of greatest disappointment.  Kevin Kline, turning in
one of his better performances, plays Nick Bottom as a wonderfully
tragi-comic sadsack, an unhappily married laborer with grand dreams of how
the stage will offer him a chance at greatness.  When he is simultaneously
transformed into an ass and into the object of desire of the love
potion-affected Fairy Queen Titania (Michelle Pfeiffer), it's touching to
note how his moment of glory makes him oblivious to his physical state.
Unfortunately, Hoffman doesn't exploit Kline's performance for all it can
offer, never really delivering a satisfying resolution to the character he
has set up.</P>
<P>     He does, however, build to a wonderfully comic climax as the actors
finally perform their play within the play.  The bumbling performance is
pure slapstick -- malapropped lines, misaligned props, over-the-top acting
and, to quote SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, a bit with a dog.  The one nice twist
comes as Flute (Sam Rockwell), the actor-in-drag performing the ingenue
in the play, breaks from character to deliver an earnest paean to true
love.  It's a sweet note on which to end a play of sometimes discordant
tones, perhaps making this DREAM seem less uneven that it should.  The
course of this tale about the course of true love never does run smooth;
it merely offers a fanciful comedy deserving enough of the author's name.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 enchanted forests:  7.</PRE>
