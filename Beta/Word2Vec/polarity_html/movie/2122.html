<P>     A guy with a name like Rowdy Herrington had better make a more
impressive film than this if he doesn't want his name to get confused
with that of a professional wrestler.</P>
<P>     Tom Hardy (Bruce Willis) is a cop on Pittsburgh's water rescue
squad whose discovery of bodies floating down the river causes him to
revisit an ugly and tragic past.  Two years ago, he lost his
detective's shield when he claimed that the murder of his father,
Police Chief Hardy (John Mahoney), was committed by a cop.  No one
believed him, and the force as a whole labelled him a turncoat.  Now
Tom has a new partner, Jo Christman (Sarah Jessica Parker), who accepts
that Hardy's story may be more than a fantasy, and together the two
begin an illegal investigation of a new series of murders, which Tom
believes are inextricably linked to the chain of events which resulted
in his father's death and his own disgrace.</P>
<P>     Disappointment abounds for anyone expecting DIE HARD on water.
The only similarity is actor Bruce Willis, but this film is sadly
lacking both the slick direction of the DIE HARD movies and the
entertaining script.  For STRIKING DISTANCE, we get a routine cop
story, complete with far too many chases, moments that stretch the
viewer's credulity past the breaking point, and few legitimate
surprises.  The action is depressingly routine, and Bruce Willis has
only one or two opportunities for wise-cracking, which is clearly one
of his fortes.</P>
<P>     Actually, for the first half of the movie, the plot doesn't seem
all that bad.  It's full of cliches, but that's to be expected, and it
contains far too many stock situations, but that shouldn't surprise
anyone either.  However, any shred of competence shown by the early
script unravels as the movie zips along to its ridiculous conclusion.
The revelation of the killer is an absolute joke (and I don't mean a
funny one).  I didn't figure out the identity early, but I would have
had I not given the writing more credit than it deserves.  You see, I
was hoping things might turn out to make (gasp!) sense.</P>
<P>     Perhaps someone could tell me why Sarah Jessica Parker, who really
isn't a bad actress, would take this thankless role (the standard
answer to this question is "money").  This is a prototypical "token
female."  Not only is Jo totally uninteresting, but she's stupid.
It's sad to see anyone in a part this poor, but even more distressing
when the performer isn't some no-name actress in her first major motion
picture.  Did Ms. Parker actually think STRIKING DISTANCE would
advance her career?</P>
<P>     Bruce Willis, who has shown moments of undeniable ability (IN
COUNTRY, while not a great film, was a tour de force for the actor),
manages to be little better than annoying in STRIKING DISTANCE.  Some
of it surely has to do with his character:  a morose, self-centered man
with a drinking problem. (Why do these movies always have to have
alcoholic heroes?) There are a couple of solid scenes where Willis
stays within himself, but those are few and far between.</P>
<P>     Now, as for the relationship between Jo and Tom, I didn't buy it
for a moment.  Not only does it start far too quickly, and with too
flimsy of a premise given the circumstances, but it generates neither
heat nor romantic tension.  It's not that the two don't have
chemistry--given an opportunity, they might have--but the movie doesn't
allow anything to develop.  A couple of bed scenes is about the extent
of things as far as we're concerned.</P>
<P>     The opening car chase is enjoyable, even if parts of it are close
to self-parody (I was reminded of LAST ACTION HERO).  After that,
however, everything settles into the usual action film routine.  There
are about two more chases than necessary--on land and in water.  My
philosophy about chases is that they should be avoided unless the
director has something new to show off.  Needless to say, STRIKING
DISTANCE breaks that rule.  No one could accuse Herrington of anything
close to originality.  He goes strictly by-the-book, churning out a
picture that is pure formula, with a generous does of idiocy thrown
in.</P>
<P>     There are a lot of other bad things I could talk about--the
overblown score, the silly portrayal of the police, the bad dialogue,
the poor lighting in almost every scene--but I think it's pretty clear
how few are the virtues of STRIKING DISTANCE.  In fact, one of the
positive points is that the movie is too loud and noisy to fall asleep
during, which is surely what most people would do if their attention
was based on story and character.</P>
