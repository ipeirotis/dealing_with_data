<P>     Considering the wealth of material provided by the recent tragedy 
in Bosnia, it's surprising that Michael Winterbottom's WELCOME TO 
SARAJEVO is the first major Western motion picture to take place in the 
war-torn country.  It's possible to argue that the reason for this is 
that English-speaking directors are intimidated by the sheer scope and 
complexity of the conflict, and they somehow feel that any attempt on 
their part to chronicle even an aspect of the war would be inadequate.  
More likely, however, it's a pragmatic realization -- films about this 
particular subject are anathema to the public, and, because of that, 
they are likely to result in an anemic performance at the box-office.</P>
<P>     There are many possibilities why movie-goers would react negatively 
to a film about Bosnia, but the most likely reason has its roots in the 
way the media covered the conflict.  During the early 1990s, we were 
bombarded by images from the war on a daily basis.  All the networks had 
reporters on the front lines, and, as a result, every nightly newscast 
featured images of bodies, soundbytes of world leaders condemning the 
attempted genocide, and pictures of bombed-out cities and villages.  
But, to keep viewers from turning to another channel, it was all 
sanitized.  There was no sense of true horror; this was half a world 
away.  It didn't seem real, and the television coverage was edited in a 
manner designed to keep our repugnance at bay.  Consequently, the public 
became apathetic about the Bosnian war, and, after a while, began to 
tune it out.  Yet, on some level, everyone recognized that something 
genuinely terrible was transpiring; we just didn't want to understand 
the depth of it.  So a movie that challenges us by revealing truths 
about this conflict threatens our comfort level in a way that 
SCHINDLER'S LIST (about events that happened 50 years ago) never did.  
We don't want to know; it's too unpleasant and disquieting.</P>
<P>     WELCOME TO SARAJEVO isn't just the story of an outsider's 
perspective of the conflict; it's a compelling examination of the role 
the media played in reporting and shaping the average person's views of 
the war.  And, while there's nothing revolutionary or extraordinary 
about the dramatic narrative, the subtext gives Winterbottom's movie its 
force.  As a tale focused upon the horrors of war, WELCOME TO SARAJEVO 
doesn't cover any new ground, but as an autopsy of what the conflict 
meant to a worldwide television audience, this is new and disturbing 
material.  Oddly enough, the film has as much in common with Gus Van 
Sant's attack on television news, TO DIE FOR, as it does with pictures 
like VUKOVAR and PRETTY VILLAGE, PRETTY FLAME.  </P>
<P>     Unlike those two films and numerous others that show the Bosnian 
war from an insider's viewpoint, WELCOME TO SARAJEVO makes its main 
character a British TV news reporter.  The movie does not delve deeply 
into the reasons for the conflict, nor does it burden viewers with 
lengthy discourses on the centuries-old racial and religious strife.  
Instead, we are presented with a shocking snapshot of how things were 
during several months in late 1992 and early 1993.  We witness the 
bodies, the carnage, and, most chillingly, concentration camp images 
that echo those seen in post-World War 2 photographs.  </P>
<P>     The British newsman at the center of WELCOME TO SARAJEVO is Michael 
Henderson (Stephen Dillane), whose character is based on a real-life 
individual (just as the movie's script was developed from the non-
fictional account, "Natasha's Story").  He's a veteran war reporter 
stationed in Sarajevo along with his cameraman, Gregg (James Nesbitt), 
and his producer, Jane (Kerry Fox).  Other reporters include the cynical 
American Jordan Flynn (Woody Harrelson) and a freelancer named Annie 
(Emily Lloyd), who is young and driven.  For his part, Michael is 
growing disenchanted with his network's coverage of the news, and this 
leads to his involvement in an ongoing story about a front-line 
orphanage.  What begins as a series of reports turns into a crusade, 
with Michael imperiling both his career and his life to get one 9-year 
old girl, Emira (Emira Nusevic), out of the country at a time when the 
official policy is "no evacuation."  WELCOME TO SARAJEVO charts 
Michael's progress from dispassionate watcher to activist.</P>
<P>     Throughout the film, we are given glimpses of the way the 
journalists on the scene report the news, and what becomes of their 
stories.  One particularly graphic massacre is bumped from the top of 
the hour in favor of an item about the separation of the Duke and 
Duchess of York.  Michael's producer, Jane, warns him that his crusade 
about the orphanage may be falling on deaf ears.  It's all about 
ratings.  Information is less important than entertainment, and it's 
difficult to make such a grotesque, twisted war, where sniper fire kills 
innocent bystanders, entertaining.  By using a combination of real 
archived video, faux video filmed specifically for this movie, and 
normal 35 mm footage, Winterbottom creates a kaleidoscope of juxtaposed 
images.  We're never sure what's true and what isn't -- whether a video 
of writhing, bloody bodies is genuine or a realistic recreation.  This 
technique further illustrates how blurred the line has become between 
authentic, hard news and its controlled, entertainment-controlled 
counterpart.</P>
<P>     In previous films like GO NOW and JUDE, Winterbottom has shown a 
keen understanding of character and an unwillingness to toy with an 
audience's emotions through overt manipulation, and both of these 
characteristics are evident in WELCOME TO SARAJEVO.  The main characters 
of Michael, Emira, and Flynn are all well-defined and strongly 
portrayed.  Stephen Dillane is entirely believable as the lead, and 
Woody Harrelson, who is slowly developing into an effective dramatic 
performer, fleshes out Flynn.  Young Emira Nusevic is heartbreaking in 
her pivotal role.  There are also several noteworthy supporting players, 
including Goran Visnjic as a citizen of Sarajevo who works as Michael's 
driver and Marisa Tomei as an idealistic "do-gooder."</P>
<P>     WELCOME TO SARAJEVO debuted at 1997's Cannes Film Festival, where 
it received numerous plaudits but no awards.  This impeccably-crafted 
movie is a daring and powerful piece of work, not only for its 
willingness to film an unpopular subject, but for the unique perspective 
it offers, and it stands proudly alongside Winterbottom's other films.  
Hopefully, neither the title nor the subject matter will deter viewers 
from experiencing this memorable motion picture.</P>
