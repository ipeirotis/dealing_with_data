<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"The Talented Mr. Ripley" offers another screen adaptation of the
Patricia Highsmith novel, the first being Rene Clement's "Purple Noon
(59)," a more straight- forward Hitchcock type of film that the French
actor Alain Delon couldn't do much with. Then there was Wim Wenders
better version, "The American Friend (77)," where Dennis Hopper got into
the sinister con man's character and showed how his criminal guilt was
related to Germany's postwar guilt. This time, in a grander and more
elaborate version, Tom Ripley (Damon) is a closet homosexual and someone
capable of killing anyone who interferes with his plans to assume
someone else's identity, which makes the crime thriller take on a
slightly different meaning from the way Highsmith intended it to be
perceived (she also wrote the novel for the great Hitchcock film,
"Strangers on a Train"). For her, life had no escapes or false
sentimentalities attached to it, it's just a trap that everyone is in
and can't get out of, exceptthey can try to make things better for
themselves through their cunning ways.</P>
<P>Anthony Minghella (The English Patient) will make the theme of the film
into an identity crises problem that Ripley has and allow the film to
become a character study about a sociopath who can complacently say
about himself, "I always thought it would be better to be a fake
somebody than a real nobody." He has removed most of the complicated
psychological layers of the character and made Ripley into a seemingly
nicer sort of person, the murder he commits is not premeditated as in
the novel but comes about when he is provoked beyond what his fragile
nature can take.</P>
<P>Ripley is first seen playing the piano in a borrowed Princeton insignia
blazer he got from the piano player he replaced at a rooftop reception,
and the ambitious NYC men's room attendant with the Ivy League looks is
spotted there by Herbert Greenleaf (Rebhorn), the shipping magnate, as
he approaches Ripley with the thought that he is a college classmate of
his son's and comes from the same upper-class strata, and he therefore
makes a snap decision to have Ripley go find his wandering playboy son
in Italy and urge him to come home. For his troubles, he will be paid a
thousand dollars and expenses.</P>
<P>Minghella paints a picturesque view of how these rich Americans in the
late 1950s live as ugly Americans in Europe, as the photography is
brilliant, with its array of luminous colors, from Mediterranean places
such as San Remo, Palermo, Roma, and Venice. The beautiful
scenery,villas, luxurious hotels, and splendid boat rides are just right
for getting the audience all excited about taking a look at how the
smart-set travel and spend their leisure time. This fits in nicely with
the touristy look of the film. But the story, as engrossing as it is,
can so easily be forgotten when the film ends.</P>
<P>This is a big budget Miramax film, not an arthouse personal film. Its
magnificent look took away any kind of noir intent the novel might have
had if the film was done in the pure form it was written in.</P>
<P>The film becomes primarily a character study about Ripley and not a film
that is too concerned about filling all the holes it has in its plot,
which are enough to sink a ship. Ripley is unsatisfied with his lot in
life and takes this once in a lifetime chance to be with the elite. He
manages to engage the manipulative and good-looking Dickie (Jude) in the
Italian seaside town he is idling away his time in, who seems to act
more queer than Ripley but apparently isn't, as he is sexually active
with his girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth), someone Ripley tries to befriend.
She just seems to be along for the ride- her part is a rather
inconsequential one, though it is in the same vein as the tiresome parts
she usually stars in, but here we are, at least, spared from seeing
tears come down her reddened cheeks. We just see her justifiable
petulant anger, as she gives Ripley that knowing bitchy look of
disapproval, indicating I know what you did to my Dickie.</P>
<P>Ripley's main intent, will be to concentrate on absorbing himself in
Dickie's personality and to try to ingratiate himself with the
womanizing and capricious wastrel- a part that Jude does a good job of
conveying, as he captures the character's nasty mood swings as well as
his goofy flippant side. One of the ways Ripley endears himself to
Dickie, is sharing in his love for jazz with him, even though, he is
only interested in the music because he knows that Dickie is. This
friendship, built on his telling Dickie the reason that his father sent
him here, will work out well as long as Dickie finds him amusing, but
the relationship soon becomes frayed, as Dickie becomes irritated with
some of his homoerotic gestures and grows tired of his lingering
presence around him.</P>
<P>When asked by Dickie what his one talent is, Ripley names three- forger,
liar, and impersonator. As the creepy young man will use his acquired
talents to ingratiate himself to his superiors; he is seen here as being
less a scam artist than he is of being someone trying desperately to fit
in where he doesn't belong. When he senses he can't be a hanger-on with
Dickie or Dickie's crowd anymore, he seizes the moment to kill Dickie
and take his identity, as he discovers he has a talent for murder also.</P>
<P>Having already maneuvered his way into Dickie's crowd, but with no great
lasting friendships in sight, his two greatest successes being with the
textile heiress Meredith Logue (Cate) and the wealthy Peter
Smith-Kingsley (Davenport). He met Meredith aboard the ship to Italy,
and told her that he is Dickie Greenleaf and managed to get her to think
they are kindred spirits and to have her fall pathetically in love with
him. She will turn up at odd moments in his travels and be portrayed as
the spoiled rich girl who doesn't know what to do with herself. The
trick in this relationship, is for Ripley to think quickly on his feet
so that she will not know that he is an impostor. His other positive
relationship will be a homosexual one, as Peter will know him as Ripley
and be used by him to cover his murderous tracks.</P>
<P>The strongest performance in the film comes from Freddie Miles (Philip
Seymour Hoffman), as an edgy, playboy friend of Dickie's, who smells out
Ripley but just fails to realize how deadly he can be. The scenes with
Freddie pushed the envelope wide-open and made the average intelligence
that Ripley possessed diminish in his chilling presence. Hoffman's
screen presence sparked keen interest in the story and made it seem more
powerful when he was onscreen. When he wasn't onscreen, the story wasn't
quite as fascinating, which made me wonder if he would have been even
more suited to play Ripley than the bland Damon was.</P>
<P>As the story gets violently out-of-hand, the pleasure in the film
becomes mostly in watching the obvious lies Ripley tells when confronted
by someone who knows that he is not being straight with them and yet he
is shown to still manage to think fast on his feet and come up with a
fitting story to put them off his trail. And, even if, there seems to be
little sympathy for the idle-rich during Ripley's spree, there also
becomes less and less sympathy for the psychopathic Ripley, who the
filmmaker was insidiously trying to get the viewer to identify with.</P>
<P>The only question remaining becomes not why Ripley is doing this but
whether or not he will get caught. Thereby, the film loses touch with
the character who falls too far from the graces of any rationality for
social acceptance, who is seen drowning in his own lies and trapped in
his own guilt-ridden nature. In the novel, Ripley is more of a
long-range scheming sociopath than he is in the film. The new
spontaneous twists in the film changes the mood of the story, and makes
it more creepy but not more endearing. I think the reason for that, is
because the Matt Damon part loses the character's rich rebellious flavor
and makes him become less an antihero than viewed as a serial murderer.
To fully identify with Ripley would require the viewer losing himself
totally in the character and seeing the world only through Ripley's
narcissistic eyes, and that is the way Minghella probably wanted one to
see the film and understand how Ripley operated. The problem with that,
is it simplified all the dark notions of Ripley's character and
lightened the burden of the story too much, trying to make it conform
with the '90s style of film. As a result, this seductive film comes to a
conclusion that failed to live up to the gamesmanship offered throughout
most of the story. The film became less meaningful the longer it went
on, and it ran for 139- minutes.</P>
