DIARY OF A SEDUCER (director: Daniele Dubroux; cast: Chiara
Mastroianni(Claire), Melvil Poupaud (Gregoire Moreau), Hubert
Saint-Macary (Hubert Markus), Mathieu Amalric(Sebastien), Daniele
Dubroux (Anne), Jean-Pierre Leaud (Hugo), Micheline Presle (Diane),
Serge Merlin (scientist), 1995-Fr.)</P>
<P>The movie is very loosely adapted from Soren Kierkegaard's early
treatise on beauty, infatuation and the power of intellectual
persuasion. An old copy of the Danish philosopher's work is passed from
person to person to act as a love potion, as it turns those who possess
it into becoming irrational romantics.</P>
<P>The film is a romantic comedy, with the trappings for a detective story
thrown in for good measure, as murder somehow gets into the story, with
the help of all the vulnerable and oddball characters who are involved
in the romantic shenanigans going on. But the explicit sex is kept to
the minimum; instead, it uses the need to find romance as a form of
irony to point out the thin line that separates love from madness. The
film is very brutal on psychoanalysts and their pet theories. It
pretends to be supportive of philosophy and its intrinsic intellectual
powers that society has very little value for, but does not move the
film in that direction. Instead, it opts for light comedy.</P>
<P>Gregoire Moreau (Melvil Poupaud) is a philosophy student who looks a lot
like the young Greenwich Village Bob Dylan looked ...his diabolical aim
is to score girls, and the Diary is the perfect prop for him to do this.
We pick up the tale, when he lays his trap for Claire (Chiara
Mastroianni), a college student, who is undergoing  psychoanalysis. All
the characters in this story have some problem with understanding who
they are and what are the boundaries for their behavior. So, even if the
story tends to be implausible, it still makes sense in a nonsense sort
of way, as Claire, soon after reading the Diary, drops the virginal and
sexually ambivalent suitor Sebastien (Mathieu Amalric), who has somehow
managed to move in with her and her single mother, Anne (Daniele), who
happens to be a doctor. The chemistry is much better between Sebastien
and Anne, a match that no one can possibly believe should be taking
place, but is funny to watch as the opinionated and pushy Sebastien
operates his inane charm on the sophisticated and attractive older
woman, until she nearly makes a complete fool of herself. He does this
without having read the Diary, but is working on his own diary, which
Anne reads and is insulted but somewhat flattered by, reading the
immaturity of his statements about her that he wrote in the diary, of
how he would like to conquer her since her daughter has rejected him.</P>
<P>Hugo (Jean-Pierre Leaud) who seems to be reduced to playing small parts
as  weirdoes in recent films, I'm thinking of films like IRMA VEP, is
smashing in his role as the former professor of Gregoire who has gone
mad after reading the Diary, waxing on at a party about his love for the
stand-offish Diane (Micheline), who is the agoraphobic, former actress
grandmother of Gregoire. At his party, which he invited thirty guests,
he manages only to lure Claire and a late arrival and two musicians
playing music from India, who all leave after seeing how bizarre Hugo
is, waving a gun, talking about suicide if he can't have Diane, and
ranting like a lunatic.</P>
<P>The main focus of the story is about the developing relationship between
the nice girl Claire and the stealth, quiet-spoken Gregoire. Claire,
dependent on her all-knowing shrink, Hubert (Hubert), for answers,
naturally she tells him about the Diary, Gregoire, and the corpse she
found in the refrigerator of his apartment. The shrink reads the Diary
and falls madly in love with Claire, losing hold of himself and
endangering his marriage, this is in contrast to his previously superior
rational couch-side manner he had when doing a therapy session. He is
now in need of a shrink, himself.</P>
<P>With all these characters and precarious situations abounding, the movie
still had a flatness to it, though, admittedly, in some spots the
craziness of the characters was hilarious. The flatness is derived from
some spark that is missing from the film. As for me, I wasn't taken with
the main character, Gregoire, and therefore, had little interest in his
strange love affair and his affixation with magic. The story itself was
weakened by its not being developed further. It seemed to be thrown
together as if it were a series of comedy skits. The film did have a
good sense of tongue-in-cheek humor, keeping it lighthearted. But for a
film about a book a great philosopher wrote, not to be thoughtful, is in
my humble opinion, only an example of a filmmaker trying so hard to be
devilish but succeeding only in becoming vulgar in a Philistine way.</P>
