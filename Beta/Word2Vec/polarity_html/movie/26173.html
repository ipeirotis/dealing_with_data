<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This psychological thriller is based on John Hopkin's play "This Story
of Yours." This is a brilliantly acted picture, especially the
performances of both Sean Connery as the veteran policeman but the now
emotionally tortured inquisitor, Sgt. Johnson, and the perverse
character Ian Bannen plays, as Kenneth Baxter, who is brought in for
questioning by the police as a suspect during a child-molestation
investigation.</P>
<P>The film was in some ways spoiled but not ruined by the pretentiously
arty way it was directed. It framed its shots in an exaggerated arty
manner, which took away from the subtlety of the unfolding story. There
was also one glaring weakness, since the girl victim was still alive,
the questioning should have been halted till she was well enough to
identify the suspect, since it was disclosed that she was in the
hospital but would definetly recover from the attack. This would have
prevented the brutality resulting from the questioning.</P>
<P>There are puffy white bulls eyes exhibited around Johnson's head
everytime the burned-out cop is having visions of what the perverted
rapist had been doing to the 12-year-old girl he attacked, as he gets
increasingly incensed while questioning Baxter. He identifies so much
with what the perp is thinking, that he can just look at him and know if
he did the crime or not. That Baxter and Johnson are of the same mind
and know how to inflict hurt on each other, becomes the theme of the
film, as Johnson is seen changing places with Baxter during the course
of events.</P>
<P>The film opens in the police station, where Johnson is going berserk and
then is restraint by the other police in the station. The story then
goes into a flashback and we see Sgt. Johnson stationed by an elementary
school, watching all the children getting picked up by their parents,
since there has been three recent cases of child rapes in the area.</P>
<P>We see the rapist wait in the car near the school and follow a girl who
is alone, Janie Edwards, across the commons and attack her in a muddy
area. When the girl is reported missing the police search the area and
Johnson discovers her cowering in the mud, in a state of shock. He is
badly taken aback when he sees her in this condition, boiling over with
anger, imagining what the rapist did to her.</P>
<P>The police who are checking out everyone who looks suspicious, bring in
Kenneth Baxter, who is covered with mud and is seen walking around in
the downtown area. At the stationhouse they can't wait to grill him and
begin the questioning despite not given the word to do so by their boss.
The audience knows that he is guilty because we saw him at the scene of
the crime. Johnson knows he's guilty by just looking into his eyes. The
police who question him can't get him to say anything but learn that he
is a married man with two teenage daughters and is considered a
respected member of the community. The police boss arrives at the
stationhouse and the police halt their questioning, as the boss wants
some evidence presented before holding him on any charges.</P>
<P>But Johnson has become obsessed with this case, more than any of the
others he has worked on in his 20 years on the force, as he sneaks back
into the room the suspect is being held and relieves the guard from the
room. Baxter senses that Johnson knows he did it and fears him. During
the course of this unauthorized interrogation, the things inside their
two heads will come out in the open. Johnson says that this type only
respects pain and that he has been smugly laughing at the other officers
questioning him. In this claustrophobic holding-room, Johnson bullies
Baxter, while Baxter sneers at him in a mocking tone. When Johnson
snaps, he begins to punch Baxter around the room, which brings the film
back to the beginning of the flashback, when the other police in the
station come in to stop him. Johnson is put on suspension and told to
remain home for the night. Ironically, Baxter is rushed to the same
hospital the girl is in.</P>
<P>At Johnson's home, we see how unhappily married he is and how his life
seems empty and unfulfilled, as he gets into a long brewing spat with
his wife (Merchant). The dynamics between the two is powerful and
stinging to both psyches, as the two can't commute to each other, there
is nothing left in their marriage. In the middle of their argument the
police come by to inform him that Baxter died. He is brought down to the
station and the tables are turned on him, he is now being questioned by
a superior officer from headquarters (Trevor), and is being bullied in
the same way he has done to countless suspects.</P>
<P>The film remains fascinating, aided by impeccable performances and a
dialogue that has some bite in it. The film might appear too stagy for
some, but I found it an absorbing experience. It held my interest
throughout.</P>
