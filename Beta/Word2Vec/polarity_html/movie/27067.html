<P>     If it was director Darren Aronofsky's goal to use REQUIEM FOR A DREAM
as a variation on A CLOCKWORK ORANGE's Ludivico treatment ... well,
mission accomplished. His adaptation of Huber Selby, Jr.'s novel is a
dazzling multi-media assault, a tale of degradation and shattered lives
that will make you feel as though you need a brain enema to cleanse your
memory of its most disturbing images. Aronofsky's singularly inventive
visual style, combined with one of the year's most chillingly evocative
scores by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet, dares you not to look
away, lest you miss something potentially extraordinary. REQUIEM FOR A
DREAM is arresting, compelling and frequently flat-out horrifying.</P>
<P>     So why isn't it one of the best films of the year, if not _the_ best
film? Because for all of Aronofsky's stylistic prowess, and all the film's
visceral power, this narrative falls into an all-too-common trap: It
spells out too much of the subtext, and doesn't trust the viewer to get
the point without a good-old fashioned bludgeoning. The story focuses on
four characters in search of an exit in Brooklyn. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen
Burstyn) is a widow who spends her days eating chocolates and watching
info-mercials in her Coney Island apartment. Her only son Harry (Jared
Leto) is a heroin addict who keeps pawning Sara's television to fix
himself, his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and best pal Tyrone
(Marlon Wayans). Harry and company have a plan to become independent by
going into the dealing business themselves, a plan they think will make
all their dreams come true. Sara, meanwhile, may have a chance to fulfill
her own dream of being a contestant on a TV game show, but first she'll
have to lose a lot of weight to get into her favorite red dress -- even if
that means taking a few habit-forming diet pills.</P>
<P>     During the portion of REQUIEM FOR A DREAM when these characters still
have hope that their dreams may come true, it's a dynamic film experience.
Aronofsky eschews the typical fetishistic shots of injections,
substituting rapid-fire montages to represent the characters' respective
fixes. He gets inside the highs and lows, sometimes with sound (a
depressant turning words from the television into a gradually slowing
record), sometimes with images (a fish-eye lens distorting Sara into a
startling grotesquerie). There are brilliant moments both when the film is
at its most kinetic (Sara's speed-fuelled cleaning jags) and at its most
serene (Harry and Marion sharing a tender split-screen moment in which
their physical connection is disturbingly disjointed). As he demonstrated
in 1998's PI, Aronofsky is one of the few true visionaries making American
movies.</P>
<P>     There's style to spare in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, but there's not as
much substance as there should be, and what substance there is becomes too
blatant in its presentation. Early in the film, an intriguing theme
develops as we see Sara indulge in her sweets and self-help TV: Even as
she frets over Harry's addiction, it's clear she seeks some mood-altering
quick fixes of her own. But Aronofsky spells it out when he has Harry
note, "What's mom's fix? Television!" Similarly, a subtle moment in which
Sara is given a preferred seat among the women outside her building --
just because she may be on television in the near future -- is underlined
by Sara's comment on her royal treatment. Every time REQUIEM FOR A DREAM
is on the verge of being about more than its characters' inevitable spiral
into agony, it quickly offers the Cliff's Notes version and moves you
along to the next moment of personal hell.</P>
<P>     And eventually, all those moments of personal hell become wearying.
As splendidly acted as REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is -- and every one of the four
principals is very good, particularly Burstyn -- it's ultimately a film
that pays far more attention to the things drugs does to these people than
what it takes away from them. It becomes such a relentless parade of
dignity-destroying acts and physical disintegration that the broadly
sketched characterizations vanish in the wake of their misery. It
conditions you to feel repulsed by what drugs do to these people without
allowing you to feel for them as people. This is spectacularly staged and
marvelously performed "Just Say No" melodrama -- REEFER MADNESS for the
art house set. It's impossible not to get REQUIEM FOR A DREAM's message,
and nearly impossible not to applaud the messenger. But after 102 minutes,
it feels like you've been strapped into a chair while the message imbeds
itself into your pried-open eyeballs.</P>
