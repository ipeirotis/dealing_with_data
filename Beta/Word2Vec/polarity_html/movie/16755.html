<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece):
4 and half stars</P>
<P>Shakespeare in Love's recipe for success is a simple one.  Due to the
film's superb screenplay and sound acting, director John Madden is able
to pick and match the best parts of three different genres.  Clever
comedy, charming romance and absorbing drama fit neatly into this period
piece, which has a distinctly contemporary feel.  Ordinarily it would be
fair enough to point out that a director probably shouldn't attempt to
have the best of both worlds (so to speak); but here, Madden has the
best of three.</P>
<P>Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has writers block.  He's just begun
working on a proposed play titled "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's
Daughter," but struggles to find inspiration to express himself.  But,
like the play's title, Shakespeare's life soon changes for the better.
He finds motivation in the form of Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), who is
destined to marry the snobby Lord Wessex (Colin Firth) at the command of
Queen Elizabeth herself (Judi Dench, in a cleverly arrogant
performance).  Shakespeare and Viola live out their doomed romantic
fantasy, whilst the formalities (and informalities) of producing a
theatrical production blare in the background.</P>
<P>Those interested in Shakespearean times will appreciate the film's
suggestions and insights into what happened during this era.
Shakespeare in Love suggests how the mysterious death of famous
playwright Christopher Marlowe (played by the always dependable Rupert
Everett) occurred, and hints at how the prohibition of women on the
stage was eventually revoked (during the era, men had to play women in
drag).  On the other hand, those who desire two hours worth of solid
entertainment will get more than they paid for. Comic performances from
Geoffrey Rush as a struggling theatre owner and The Full Monty's Tom
Wilkinson as the play's producer aid the film in keeping it accessible
for everyone.</P>
<P>Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow shine in the two meatiest parts.
Scenes in which Shakespeare puts pen to paper work better than you may
expect; each bringing a magical touch and an involving atmosphere.  As
he writes, we can almost feel the love that inspires him.  Paltrow
delivers one of - if not the - best performances so far in her career.
She has always had enough talent to make a difficult part work, and
should have made a performance like this a long time ago (her roles in A
Perfect Murder, Hush, Sliding Doors and others restricted her charisma).</P>
<P>With so many films nowadays that try to tell too much in too little time
(or, alternatively, films that tell too little in too much time), here
is one that never oversteps the mark.  There are so many paths the film
could have taken, but Madden focuses almost entirely on the central
relationship and the first ever production of "Romeo and Juliet."
Shakespeare in Love's recipe for success is a simple one, but not an
easy one to pull off.  Its carefully crafted screenplay interlaces
drama, romance and comedy smartly and efficiently in this charming and
passionate tale.  Shakespeare in Love has a big heart, but never loses
its grasp on reality or the tragedy of forbidden love.  Not only does it
work as an upbeat period piece, but also as just about anything you want
it to be.</P>
