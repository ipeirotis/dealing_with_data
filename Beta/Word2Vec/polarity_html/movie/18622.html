THIEF, THE (VOR) ( director: Pavel Chukhrai; cast: Sanya-6-years-old
(Misha Philipchuk), Toljan (Vladimir Mashkov), Katya (Yekaterina
Rednikova), the 12-year-old Sanya (Dima Shigarev), Amalya Mordvinova
(doctor's wife), 1997-Russian)</P>
<P>Certain people just never have any luck. Katya (Yekaterina) is such a
person.  Katya's husband died on the front during WW11 and this
attractive young lady, is left with a child, Sanya (Misha), to raise on
her own. It is now 1952 and she boards a train with her 6-year-old
Sanya, and a handsome soldier flirts with her, and she instinctively
takes up with him, happy to have someone strong take care of her. The
film is narrated by the child who is now an adult, speaking in a
voiceover, telling about how that event on the train, when the soldier,
Toljan (Mashkov), acted as a father to him, was the most momentous time
of his life, that irrevocably changed it, eventually even stealing away
the dreams and visions he once had.That the soldier turned out, not only
to be an army deserter, but a thief, who steals everything he can, even
his mother's heart, is the basis for him telling his sad and ponderous
story. (Can a Russian film be anything but ponderous?)</P>
<P>The strength of this symbolical film, is in the way the director Pavel
Chukhrai, is able to explicitly show the harshness of the Stalin years
as it infected the daily life of its citizens.The thief himself has a
tattoo of Stalin on his chest, which he uses to impress those who look
at his strong body.</P>
<P>Katya (the symbol of mother Russia) slowly begins to see how rotten he
is, despite his disarming smoothness and beguiling charm he could lay on
at the drop of a hat. When in the boarding house, where they get a room,
under the false pretense that they are a family, he invites all the
boarders to the circus, and while they are there, he sneaks back to the
house and robs them. Katya followed him home from the circus and cursed
her fate when seeing what he was up to, but she fell in love with the
rascal and made the choice of  running away to the next town with him
anyway, in the hopes he could be a good father to her son and provide
for the family.</P>
<P>Sanya would not call him father, only uncle, and found it difficult to
adjust to the close attention the mother was paying to Toljan, that once
went exclusively to him. He has constant haunting visions that his real
father was watching him, wanting him to be loyal only to him.</P>
<P>Toljan's way of introducing him into manhood, is to have the kid strike
back at the boys who beat him. The threat of giving the strap to Sanya,
makes the boy pee in his pants. Sanya is always peeing in his pants when
he is frightened, which the shrewd Toljan acts upon, to gain the
confidence of the kid who instinctively didn't like him, by reassuring
him it is just fine to be afraid, telling him that he will eventually
grow out of it. The kid is so hungry for real fatherly affection, that
this mock affection is enough for him to let his guard down against the
professional con man, who epitomizes the evil of the Stalin years.</P>
<P>The weakness of the film, is that it is really not drama, but soap
opera, that is convincingly done through the powerful persona that
Mashkov, a Russian stage actor and romantic star of cinema, is able to
evoke from his strong performance, who is cruel and capable of being
loved at the same time. But the story seems contrived, it just flows too
neatly together without having an energy of its own. So everything must
fit together: Toljan must get arrested as a deserter, Katya is left
alone and must die, and Sanya must go to an orphanage; and, when Sanya
recognizes Toljan, at last, as his new father, who left him only a gun
when he went to prison, he keeps the gun, trying to decide if he should
go against his own nature and become like Toljan.</P>
<P>He runs into Toljan accidently, after 7 years of not seeing him, and
when Toljan doesn't even remember him, or mistakeningly thinks that he
is the son he fathered with some woman named Katya, the 12-year-old  boy
is completely disillusioned, especially seeing that Toljan is still
working his old con game and, that, Sanya in one desperate moment of his
life betrayed his real father and called Toljan father, has made him to
stop believing in anything anymore, no more dreams, hopes, illusions; he
is all alone in the world, there is only nothing, nothing to believe in,
as he uses the only present he got from his new father, a gun, on his
new father, to wipe out all his memories.</P>
<P>The story is just too pat to be that effective, except as a curious look
at what the Russians themselves thought of Stalin and how they
functioned under his regime during the '50s. The symbolism was too heavy
handed to be fully believed as a viable panacea for its corrupt past,
suggesting that the only way for the country to be free, is for the son,
who is the future of the country, to kill the corrupt father who
betrayed his family (country).</P>
