<PRE>                                   CYCLO
                                 (XICH LO)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     CYCLO (XICH LO) is the second feature length film by director Tran
Anh Hung.  His first was the highly acclaimed and much gentler THE
SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA.  In certainly a change of pace, CYCLO is a
depressing, violent, claustrophobic, and confusing tale.  I tried hard
to like it, but had to give up in futility.  I will give it this, it is
a gritty film.</P>
<P>     CYCLO is set and was filmed in contemporary Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam.  It tells the story of a man, played by Le Van Loc, who works
as a cyclo - a bicycle with a small seat in front for carrying one or
more passengers plus assorted luggage, food, animals, you name it.  In
the movie he is known simply as The Cyclo.  As the director and
co-writer Hung says in the press kit, "for me the term refers equally
to the driver and his vehicle."</P>
<P>     The Cyclo leads a tragic life.  His mother died in childbirth and
his father was a cyclo who was killed at work in a traffic accident.
Early in the story a gang steals The Cyclo's cyclo, and he soon decides
if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  He has a sister, known only as The
Sister (Tran Nu Yen-Khe), who is in love with her pimp, The Poet (Tony
Leung Chiu Wai).</P>
<P>     If the film's purpose is to shock us into how bad it is now in
Vietnam, then at least on that score it succeeds.  The violence shown
ranges from sadistic to worse.  People have funnels forced down their
throats, and they are almost drowned in water until they come close to
gagging themselves to death by throwing up.  Others take boards with
large nails in them and hit people's head until they are dead as the
blood spurts everywhere.  In another scene a person is horribly and
realistically burned with a Molotov cocktail.  This is making me
nauseous so I am going to stop giving examples.  You get the picture by
now.  As an aside, there are some extremely violence films that I have
loved, but here it is so gratuitous and excessive that it turned me
off.</P>
<P>     Even absent the gore, the story is a depressing one.  The Sister
is not just a prostitute, she is one that has to engage in shall we say
some unusual activities.  The cinematography (Benoit Delhomme and
Laurence Tremolet) is full of tight close-ups in highly confined
quarters.  It makes you want to go outside and get some fresh air it is
so claustrophobic.</P>
<P>     The script contains little dialog and like the recent Iranian
film, THE WHITE BALLOON, the lack of dialog is filled with the
overpowering sound of traffic noise.  What lines there are serve more
to confuse than enlighten.  Finally, the characters were so
unsympathetically drawn that you do care about what happens to any of
them which makes the massive violence seem all the more excessive.</P>
<P>     I must admit, I do like the dramatic music by Ton-That Tiet.  I
will give the director credit for being willing to experiment.  He
takes a lot of risks and fails miserably.</P>
<P>     CYCLO runs too long at 2:00.  It needs much more aggressive
editing than Nicole Dedieu and Claude Ronzeau give it.  The film is in
Vietnamese with English subtitles.  CYCLO is not rated, but would be at
least an R.  I would only let the most mature teenagers see it.  I hope
Tran Anh Hung returns to films like THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA in the
future and leaves the ultra violence movies to directors like Quentin
Tarantino who have a better sense of how to handle it.  I hated CYCLO,
but give it * for trying.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
