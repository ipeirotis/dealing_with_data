<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A fast moving film about crusading Assistant District Attorney Martin Ferguson
(Bogart) 
who goes after a mob that does contract killings. The film is loosely based on
the testimony in 1940 of mob informant Abe Reles about an organization in the
Brownsville section of Brooklyn that was known as Murder Incorporated. The crime
film tells for the first time in film how a mob works and its use of terms such
as "contract," "hit,"and "finger man." It is shot in a semi-documentary style
and looked more like a crime caper movie than the film noir category most film
critics have classified it under. </P>
<P>Ferguson prosecutes mob boss Albert Mendoza for murder. He has only one witness,
who is a minor underling in the mob, Joseph Rico, and he's set to testify
tomorrow in court. But after attempts on Rico's life, the cowardly mobster tries
to escape from the police guarding him and accidently falls to his death from
the prison building. </P>
<P>This leaves Ferguson in a bind, as he will now have to let the killer he knows
is guilty go loose. He spends the night with his trusted confidante Captain
Nelson (Roberts), sifting through all the evidence and tape recordings they have
on how Mendoza ran the mob. </P>
<P>The story of Duke Malloy catches Ferguson's interest. He is the mobster who
cracks when ordered to do a contract killing on the young woman witness to a
murder, and instead she becomes his girlfriend and runs away with him. Through
low-level underlings Big Babe and Philadelphia, Ferguson gets a clearer view of
why the gang was hired to track both the girl and Duke down. </P>
<P>Ferguson now comes across another murder witness against Mendoza--a young woman.
The film ends with Ferguson satisfied that he can now get justice in court. </P>
<P>To make the film more snappy the producers called in Raoul Walsh, though not
credited, to shoot some scenes over. His fingerprints are on the finale, where a
hired-gunman gets killed in the doorway. But the filmlooks dated. </P>
