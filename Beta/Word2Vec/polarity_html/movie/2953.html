<PRE>                              NATURAL BORN KILLERS
                       A film review by Christopher Kankel
                        Copyright 1994 Christopher Kankel</PRE>
<P>     NATURAL BORN KILLERS is really a very simple story that, in
essence, has already been told in BONNIE & CLYDE with some major
variations in emphasis, mood and degree.  Both films glamorize
"outlaws," in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass
murderers.  Both relate the story of a couple liberated by love.  But
where BONNIE & CLYDE was partial and subtle, NATURAL BORN KILLERS is
total and blatant.  Where BONNIE & CLYDE was social, NATURAL BORN
KILLERS is psychological.  What BONNIE & CLYDE hinted at, NATURAL BORN
KILLERS confronts and explores.  What Bonnie and Clyde stole, Mickey and
Mallory kill.</P>
<P>     To examine NATURAL BORN KILLERS as nothing more than a
psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds
surrounding them, expressed metaphorically as killing, subdues the
mysterious power this film wields.  For the most part, when Mickey and
Mallory kill, they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily, they
kill what is trying to kill them, they kill what dissembles and cowers
from life, they kill what needs to be killed.  This mythos is at least
as old as the Hindu trinity.  Brahma created.  Vishnu preserved.  And
Siva destroyed, but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make
way for the useful creations of Brahma.  The following may be painfully
mundane but metaphorically so accurate, I'm forced to say it for
clarity's sake: a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes,
that is, destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with
the new one made of plastics.  Your plumber, Bonnie and Clyde, Mickey
and Mallory, and Siva are all productive destroyers.</P>
<P>     I think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is
responsible for more killing and death, presently and historically,
than any other phenomena.  Muslims kill Christians.  Hindus kill
Muslims.  Christians kill pagans.  Jews kill Christians, etc.  You
could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be
challenged.  Religion is an orgy of killing.  The institution of the
State only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been
a major player for as long or the two are frequently
indistinguishable.  "The State is the divine idea upon earth," Hegel
said, meaning it is absolute, all-powerful, ineffable, unassailable,
infallible, authoritarian and patriarchal just like JHVH, Allah, God,
etc.</P>
<P>     Well, what does all this have to do with NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Let
me first say that religions of this nature, in the ideal, take the
place of sex.  Consider the Catholic Church, which in its hey-dey, took
religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever.  God
takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy
taken by the Pope, cardinals, bishops, monks, etc.  They forego the one,
in order to come closer to the other.  During the Middle Ages, when
this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged, the most repressive
regime the West has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to
power.  (Parenthetically, witness Plato as well.  In the REPUBLIC, he
attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime.  Not
coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself, regularly
assailing the passions.) Catholicism, as policy, attacks the passions
as evil.  It sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species
not as a way to pleasure.  Masturbation is considered a sin with the
sacrament of penance necessary for absolution.  This is religion, this
is authoritarianism in its essence.  As further evidence, the Nazis had
the same attitudes as the Church on these matters.  Our culture, most
of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for
thousands of years.  We can't help but adopt, even internalize some of
these same authoritarian attitudes, leading to a destructive split
between the biological and social self.</P>
<P>     Mickey and Mallory Knox internalized them, too, then through
spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the
presence of the other, discovered them, and began expurgating them from
themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves.  It
is a straightforward liberation through sex.  As some good patriarch
once observed, "you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps
their clothes on."  M&M had a vision of what the world would be like
without contradictions.  They saw what civilization and culture and
everyday life would be like under such conditions.  "The moment of
realization is worth a thousand prayers," as Mickey says.</P>
<P>     As a the most consistent and impassioned critic of Western culture
there is Nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter: Let us
look each other in the face.  We are Hyberboreans--we know well enough
how remote our place is.  "Neither by land nor by water will you find
the road to the Hyberboreans": even Pindar, in his day, knew that much
about us.  Beyond the North, beyond ice, beyond death--our life, our
happiness....  We have discovered that happiness; we know the way; we got
our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth.  Who else
has found it?--The man of today?--"I don't know either the way out or
the way in; I am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way
in"--so sighs the man of today....  This is the sort of modernity that
made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace, cowardly compromise, the whole
virtuous dirtiness of the modern Yea and Nay.  This tolerance and
largeur of the heart that "forgives" everything because it
"understands" everything is a sirocco to us.  Rather live amid the ice
than among modern virtues and other such south-winds!</P>
<P>     As far as I can tell, this is what the movie has to say.  Its
alleged critique of the media is only secondary, tertiary, quaternary,
subsidiary for sure.  For example Wayne Gayle's first report ends with
some Gen X dude saying, "If I were a mass murderer I'd be Mickey and
Mallory," in his most excellent Bill and Ted voice.  On one level you
cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized
these two psychopaths that the uncritical, impressionable Gen X dumb
guy confused the matter and took them for heroes.  It seems more likely
that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level
recognizing what M&M were up to and confessing that if he had the balls
to be so honest with himself he'd be just like them, killing and
destroying what deserves it.</P>
<P>     Let me exemplify what I've been saying by analyzing a scene from
the film, namely the scene where Mallory fucks the gas station
attendant, kills him, and then castigates him for giving her "the worst
fuckin' head I've ever had in my life!!!"  Now, I never claimed that
Mickey and Mallory had a perfect relationship, because demonstrably
they didn't, and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us
this.  Sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations, but
unwilling to kill each other, since they love each other so much and
are responsible for each others liberation, they must kill in place of
their lever.  It's no secret that in this scene Mallory fantasized that
her victim was Mickey.  As the attendant approached he took on Mickey's
character in the eyes of Mallory.  She needed to kill him because of he
kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies
about her while making love to Mallory.  Upon discovery, Mallory views
this as a betrayal, judges him, and commutes his sentence on someone
else.</P>
<P>     The style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that I won't get
into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power.
Let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a Western
with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like
suggesting the expansiveness, barreness and boredom of the frontier
lifestyle.  The rapid succession of all those 8mm, 16mm, 35mm images
from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and
sometimes out of sink instills a skittish, frenetic mood.  Also,
Jungian archetypes abound.  These can't help but trigger deep
psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they
flash across the screen for barely a few frames.</P>
<P>     Some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind.(quotes are
paraphrased only):</P>
<P>     Mickey to Mallory: "One of these days I'm gonna be cummin' for
you," in prison, while Mallory jacks Mickey off.  Semen is a symbol for
great potential and things to come.  At the time they haven't yet had
sex nor have they killed anyone yet.  The two of course go hand in
hand.  For an even more explicit semen scene see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.</P>
<P>     Mickey during his marriage to Mallory: "As creator of my universe,
I pronounce us man and wife."  The way Woody delivers this line is truly
haunting, but telling, too.  It reveals M&M are well on their way to
expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with
positive ones.  This is what Mickey means by "creator of my universe,"
he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes.  It is
not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first
appears.</P>
<P>     Scagnetti's first meeting with Mallory is through her pubic hair
he plucks from the gas station attendant's mouth.</P>
<P>     The Indian Sage releasing Mallory's father, who was reincarnated
as a snake: "Old man, go be a snake," after telling his "snake story"
that ends with "Bitch, you knew I was a snake."</P>
<P>     After Mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering
nightmare, Mallory says, "You killed LIFE!!!"  This is another telling
quote because it implies they didn't see themselves as killers of
life.  Then what were they killing up to that time? In some case just
those zombies faking their way through life, the living dead, as it
were.  In other cases, all the anti-life forces, the cops and their
parents.</P>
<P>     The butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison.  It of
course symbolizes rebirth.</P>
<P>     Dr. Emil Reingold, as portrayed by Steven Wright, passing
judgement on M&M: "Mickey and Mallory know the difference between right
and wrong, they just don't give a damn."  This is reminiscent of
Nietzsche's whole philosophy, and maybe a direct reference to his
BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL.</P>
<P>     Mickey: "The rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000
prayers."</P>
<P>     Mickey (again in his interview): "Me and you, we are not the same
species."</P>
<P>     Notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals
in terms of leadership and control.  Mickey the prisoner becomes the
leader of his little gang.  The wardens become prisoners and the
civilians like Wayne Gayle and his producer follow the leader, no
matter who it is.</P>
<PRE>     Mickey: How ya feelin'?
     Wayne: Fucking Great!
     Mickey: You got the feelin'?
     Wayne: I'm alive.  I'm alive for the first fuckin' time!</PRE>
<P>     What an incredible transformation this is.  He got the feeling and
he couldn't contain himself.  What a feeling.  That feeling of
metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe.</P>
<P>     Mickey when almost caught in a dead end, "Think, think, think,
think." Go figure it out.</P>
<P>     Dwight (Tommy Lee Jones) in general, because he may be the sickest
fuck in the whole film.  His whole attitude can be summed up with,
"Destroy them!!!"</P>
<PRE>On a scale of 1 to 10 years hard time: 10</PRE>
<PRE>.
