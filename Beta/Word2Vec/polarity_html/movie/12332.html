<P>Writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard. Harder than pouring
concrete under the Texas sun.  Harder than building a bridge over
troubled waters. And incidentally, a whole heck of a lot harder than
writing a movie review.</P>
<P>Thrillers are all variations on a theme. You have a smart, resourceful,
and powerful Bad Guy, who has a goal he has to meet. You have a noble
and brave Good Guy, who has to protect the innocent, kill the Bad Guy,
and not get killed himself in the process. The trick of thriller writing
is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner. This simple
formula can lead to            classic movies like North by Northwest,
High Noon, or Silence of the Lambs, or big summer blockbusters like Men
In Black, The Fugitive, or Air Force One, or it can lead to utter dreck
like Masterminds, Event Horizon, Kull the Conqueror.... is
anyone else getting depressed here?</P>
<P>Point is, it's not enough to follow the formula. You've got to throw in
something extra, something good and new and better than the last
version. Something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the
tickets and the popcorn and the Happy Meals. This is a hard thing to do,
but it is absolutely necessary in every way. Without that something
extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay, or
great special effects or great locations or great casting or great
performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails. That's
why The Jackal, with all its starpower, with all its budget, with all
its hype, gets a big fat F.</P>
<P>Bruce Willis is the Bad Guy, the Jackal, a legendary killer for hire.
Richard Gere is the Good Guy, a former IRA assassin with a vendetta
against the Jackal. The Jackal is trying to kill someone. Gere is trying
to stop him. Will Gere be able to stop the assassination in time and
kill the Jackal? (I'll give you three guesses, and the first two don't
count.) There are no surprises awaiting the audience in The Jackal, no
moment when you say to yourself, "I wonder what happens next?"</P>
<P>The script for the Jackal isn't ripped straight from today's headlines.
It's ripped off, straight from an episode of Millennium. Throughout the
movie, we learn what the Jackal's plans are and how he intends to
accomplish them. No surprise. The fun of a movie like this should come
from Richard Gere figuring out what the Jackal's plan is and developing
a clever plan to foil the Bad Guy. Instead, we get two (count 'em, two)
scenes where Gere is sitting in an FBI conference room somewhere and
instantly divines the Jackal's plan just as if he's Frank Black (or more
likely, just as if he's been handed a copy of the script). And we never
get more than a superficial clue as to why Gere has had this flash of
insight. It's like Gere's character is psychic, but neither he nor the
FBI (or the screenwriters) seem to know it. And just like in Millennium,
the Bad Guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the Good Guy
cares about, whether or not they are important to what he's trying to do
or not. What's more, in the last half of the movie, the Jackal,
supposedly a super-smart professional terrorist who never makes a
mistake, comes down with a major case of the stupids.</P>
<P>As for the performances... Bruce Willis manages to get through the whole
movie without a wisecrack, which is a major achievement, but not enough
reason to see the movie. His disguises are good, but not as good or as
interesting as Val Kilmer's in The Saint. Richard Gere is made to talk
the entire movie in an Irish accent, which detracts from his otherwise
lifeless and dull performance. Sidney Poitier is probably the most
disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie -- not
that his performance is bad or anything, it's not, but it is sad that
Hollywood won't use this talented actor in any part other than an FBI
agent (Shoot to Kill, Sneakers).</P>
<P>Writing a good plot and a good screenplay, like I said, is hard, but it
can be done. It wasn't done here. It is our job as consumers to reward
good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones. Do not go
see this movie. You'll only encourage the producers to make more just
like it. Instead, stay home and rent Day of the Jackal, or In the Line
of Fire, or a fire safety video, for crying out loud. Anything other
than The Jackal, which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of
other, better movies.</P>
