<P>     Going into SELENA, I didn't know or care much about the life of the 
late Tex-Mex singer, whose death in 1995 came just as she was attempting 
to break into the mainstream American pop market.  As far as I was 
aware, Selena's tragic end was just another minor footnote in music 
history -- I hadn't heard of her before and I didn't expect to hear of 
her again.  Then along came this movie, and, sitting in a darkened 
theater, watching Selena's story unfold, my perceptions changed.  I not 
only cared, but understood a measure of the tragedy that had stricken 
her fans. </P>
<P>     It would have been easy to trivialize Selena's story, turning it 
into a sudsy, made-for-TV type motion picture.  The details for 
something lurid and exploitative are there, but that was never an 
approach considered by writer/director Gregory Nava.  This is a simple 
story of hope and triumph, of one girl with the drive to succeed defying 
the odds and following her dream.  It's not an original tale -- movies 
like this abound -- but Nava's point-of-view is fresh.  </P>
<P>     In 1995's MY FAMILY, Nava explored the importance of blood ties 
within a Mexican American family.  Similar themes are woven into SELENA.  
This is a multigenerational story, exploring not only Selena's 
realization of her dreams, but the importance of her father's vision to 
all that she accomplished.  It was his belief in her that prodded her to 
follow her own path, and his support that convinced her that she could 
succeed in a field where every other Mexican American woman had failed.  </P>
<P>     Nava has brought back much of the cast of MY FAMILY to star in 
SELENA.  The two key on-screen contributors to this movie -- Jennifer 
Lopez as Selena and Edward James Olmos as her father, Abraham 
Quintanilla -- had roles in the previous feature.  Both are superb 
choices for their parts here.  Olmos breathes life and vitality into 
Abraham, a man who loves his daughter deeply, wants her to succeed, yet, 
by his own admission, doesn't know how to let go.  There's nothing 
cliched about the way Olmos approaches Abraham, who, in less expert 
hands, could have become a hackneyed type.</P>
<P>     Jennifer Lopez is radiant as the title character, conveying the 
boundless energy and enthusiasm that exemplified Selena, while 
effectively copying not only her look, but her mannerisms.  I wonder if 
Selena's family, upon watching this performance, felt an eerie sense of 
deja vu.  It's apparent from the clips of the real performer shown at 
the movie's conclusion that Lopez has done a masterful job of re-
creating a personality. </P>
<P>     The supporting roles are no less capably filled.  Constance Marie 
plays Selena's mother, Marcela.  Jackie Guerra and Jacob Vargas are her 
sister, Suzette, and brother, Abie.  Jon Seda is Chris Perez, Selena's 
husband.  Lupe Ontiveros portrays Yolanda Saldivar, the president of 
Selena's fan club who eventually shot the singer to death.  Finally, 
making her screen debut is Becky Lee Meza as Selena at age nine.  While 
Meza's performance is a little rough around the edges, she shows the 
kind of spunk we expect from someone who would grow up to become such a 
charismatic figure.</P>
<P>     One of the most fascinating aspects of SELENA is how it deals with 
culture clashes.  At one point, Abraham points out to his daughter that 
for her to be accepted on both sides of the border, she must be "more 
Mexican than most Mexicans" and "more American than most Americans."  
She must speak English and Spanish flawlessly, and has to understand and 
identify with icons of both cultures.  This is a lesson that Selena 
takes to heart.  She is an American, but she is also a Mexican, and she 
learns to draw from both cultures to form her own style.  </P>
<P>     Nava's film flows beautifully, and the concert sequences 
effectively capture the electricity of such events.  SELENA achieves the 
perfect emotional pitch for the subject, and, though this is a 
celebration of life, youth, and family, our awareness of the inevitable 
end lends a sense of poignancy to the proceedings.  It's impossible to 
watch Selena's triumphant Astrodome concert without remembering that her 
life would be snuffed out less than a month later.</P>
<P>     Fame often follows tragedy, especially when the victim is cut down 
in the prime of life.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  Roberto Clemente.  
These are just a few names in a long, long list.  Now, Selena has joined 
that roster.  This movie will serve to further elevate her name and 
advance her legend.  Had she lived, she would have turned twenty-six 
this year, and people would have said that her whole life was in front 
of her.  But Yolanda Saldivar's gun wrote the final chapter to that book 
two years ago.  Now, there is a beginning, a middle, and, sadly, an end.  
And, as told by Gregory Nava, with an assist from the Quintanilla family 
(who were heavily involved in the production), SELENA is a shining 
story.</P>
