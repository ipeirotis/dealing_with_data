<PRE>                                  ROOMMATES
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Peter Falk, D. B. Sweeney, Julianne Moore.
Screenplay:  Max Apple & Stephen Metcalfe.
Director:  Peter Yates.</P>
<P>     It is a frequent but rather silly criticism leveled at certain
Hollywood films that they are "manipulative," or push emotional
buttons.  It is silly because it is self-evident; all art tries to
make you feel a certain way, and movies are no exception.  The real,
unspoken criticism is that the movies targeted manipulate too
obviously, and are usually specifically manipulating the audience
towards a good cry.  ROOMMATES is one of these awww-inspiring
efforts, but it doesn't do the job.  Comprised of all the pieces
that are supposed to work, ROOMMATES doesn't work because it lacks a
cohesive story to complement Peter Falk's engaging performance.</P>
<P>     ROOMMATES opens in 1963 Pittsburg, where 6-year-old Michael
Holeczek (Noah Fleiss) finds himself oraphaned when his widowed
mother also dies.  Some relatives suggest sending him away to
school, but Michael's feisty, 77-year-old immigrant grandfather
Rocky (Peter Falk) will have none of that.  Michael grows up with
Rocky, and eventually moves to Columbus, Ohio to become a doctor.
Soon, however, the adult Michael (D. B. Sweeney) will have a chance
to repay Rocky for his support, as Rocky is forced to move out of
his condemned apartment and in with Michael.  Unfortunately, Rocky
tends to cramp Michael's style, especially when Michael starts
dating Beth (Julianne Moore), a social worker whose personality
clashes considerably with Rocky's.</P>
<P>     ROOMMATES seems like it could have been an interesting concept.
Generational conflict in film rarely involves characters separated
by two generations, and there are very few films that deal with
characters over 70.  There are two key differences between what
could have happened and what did happen.  The first is that while
Peter Falk is playing a character who ages from 77 to 107, he is
actually just 60.  Consequently, he is buried under layers of
prosthetics by Greg Cannom (MRS. DOUBTFIRE, THE MASK) which draw
garish attention to themselves.  Make no mistake, Falk's performance
as Rocky is entertaining; he delivers his Old World wisdom with wit
and bite.  But at a certain point, his characterization becomes
caricature, just another Grumpy Old Man who is one step ahead of his
youngers.  It is pleasant to watch Rocky grow closer to his
grandchildren, but it is less so to watch him grow progressively
entombed in latex.</P>
<P>     The second, and far more glaring, problem is that the
generational conflict angle is only a fraction of the story.  For a
while, ROOMMATES makes the most of the comic possibilities inherent
in a young, single man sharing a small room with a very
old-fashioned old man.  When Michael brings Beth home, Rocky makes
no secret of his disapproval of pre-marital sex, and it is
refreshing that his point of view is given a certain amount of
respect by the filmmakers.  A tense exchange between Beth and Rocky
is very well handled by both Julianne Moore and Falk, and highlights
everything that was most promising about the idea for ROOMMATES.</P>
<P>     Then, far too suddenly, ROOMMATES lurches onto a completely
different plot branch, with Rocky living with both Michael and Beth
and offering commentary on domestic life.  After a while, the plot
jerks onto another tangent, this one spending far too much time
focused on a custody battle and movie-of-the-week style family
squabbling.  ROOMMATES is based on a personal remembrance by
co-writer Max Apple, and it appears that he wanted to write a long
love letter to his grandfather.  That is a noble goal, but it simply
does not work as a movie because there is never a clear enough sense
of what this relationship is really supposed to be about.  It
certainly does not help that D. B. Sweeney seems to be dazed and
bored through most of the film's running time.  ROOMMATES had the
potential to be a warm and sentimental film, and for about half an
hour it has the right tone of good-natured whimsy.  But for over an
hour, it is little more than a bad soap opera:  drawn-out, confused
and maudlin.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 roommates:  4.</PRE>
