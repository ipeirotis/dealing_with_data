<P>     There is a scene about half way through BLOOD AND WINE which, for the
briefest of moments, inspires the giddy sense that you may be seeing
something quite different.  In that scene, wine merchant Alex Gates (Jack
Nicholson) is preparing to take a little trip with some very special
cargo.  Thousands of dollars in debt, Alex has stolen a diamond necklace
from one of his clients with the help of jewel thief Victor Spansky
(Michael Caine), and is about to fly to New York with his mistress
Gabriela (Jennifer Lopez) to fence the necklace.  Unfortunately, Alex's
wife Suzanne (Judy Davis) comes home unexpectedly, discovers the airline
tickets for two, and confronts Alex about what she believes is a simple
case of philandering.  The confrontation turns violent, and when Suzanne
gives Alex a couple of smacks in the head with a fireplace poker and
flees with her son son Jason (Stephen Dorff), you wonder whether you are
watching a movie with the guts to kill off Jack Nicholson in the third
reel.</P>
<P>     Seconds later, you realize you aren't; within a few minutes, you
realize you're watching a movie with an inordinate fondness for inflicting
punishment on its characters, and Nicholson just happened to be first in
line.  With all the consternation over violence in the movies, you could
easily forget that the kind of violence you tend to see in movies is
fairly distant and antiseptic:  gunfights in which people fall over like
kids on a playground, comic book hand-to-hand combat where the winner
walks away with a split lip and a smudged forehead.  BLOOD AND WINE may be
the most brutal film ever made in which a gun is never fired.  In addition
to the aforementioned fireplace poker incident, characters in BLOOD AND
WINE are injured by golf clubs, tree trunks, spear guns and the strategic
application of a fishing boat to the back of someone's legs.  Add a slow
death after a car accident and a scene of Nicholson suturing his own
eyebrow, and you have a thriller strictly for the strong of stomach.</P>
<P>     With all the unpleasantness BLOOD AND WINE asks its viewers to
tolerate, you'd think it would offer a more satisfying pay-off for all the
time spent shifting in their seats.  Instead, director Bob Rafelson (who
also co-created the story) serves up a fairly conventional set of film
noir character relationships:  lovers who are using each other, family
members who hate each other, partners who are ready to stab each other in
the back at the drop of a hat.  That certainly creates an appropriately
dark tone, but there is scarcely a drop of wit to lighten the relentless
gloom.  After recent films like BOUND have found a way to make you giggle
at the tough talk even as you are engrossed in the story, BLOOD AND WINE
comes off as something to be endured rather than enjoyed.</P>
<P>     It might have helped a bit if there had been a hero worth rooting
for.  Stephen Dorff's Jason is ostensibly the protagonist, a simple lad
with simple dreams of owning his own fishing boat, but his character is
too much like a moody teenager.  He sneers defiant insults at stepfather
Alex and falls in lust at first sight with Gabriela, all the while acting
like a 14-year-old rather than a 24-year-old.  His refusal to get a life
of his own might have made sense if the script had really followed up on a
whisper of Oedipal sub-text between Jason and Suzanne; instead, you just
want him to stop pouting and find an apartment.  Gabriela's motives are
kept secret, but she is a pale shadow of the great noir temptresses, and
Davis has too little to do.  Alex, meanwhile, is never even given a chance
to earn our sympathy, not that Nicholson tries very hard.  If he had
played FARGO's Jerry Lundegaard, this is what he would have looked like:
a selfish jerk who thinks the world owes him something.</P>
<P>     The only genuinely interesting think in BLOOD AND WINE -- and it is a
very interesting thing -- is Michael Caine's performance as Victor.  A
wheezing wretch in the final stages of emphysema, Victor is chillingly
pathetic in his attempts at playing the slick con man as he repeatedly
attempts to stifle his bloody coughs.  He is the most desperate of the
desperate characters in BLOOD AND WINE, a career criminal counting on this
one big, final score to allow him to die in comfort; when Suzanne
unwittingly takes the necklace with her after her fight with Alex, Victor
is willing to do anything necessary to get it back.  Caine gives Victor
the weight of a Shakespearean villain, his rotting body a reflection of
his rotted morality, but his actions always seem born of fear rather than
spite.  Only Caine keeps you watching when your better judgment recommends
turning away from BLOOD AND WINE, a film where you find yourself ducking
to avoid the psychic shrapnel as characters inflict pain on each other as
though it were their job.</P>
