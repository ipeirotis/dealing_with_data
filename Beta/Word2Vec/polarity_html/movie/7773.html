                       A film review by Ted Prigge
                        Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: John Pasquin
Writers: Bruce A. Evans and Raymond A. Gideon
Starring: Tim Allen, Sam Huntington, Martin Short, Lolita Davidovitch, 
JoBeth Williams, David         Ogden Stiers, Leelee Sobieski</P>
<P>Okay, I just don't know why, but I seem to be getting this diversion to 
Disney-made real-life actors movies...as well as real-life acting Tim 
Allen movies.  I couldn't even make it through "The Santa Clause," so 
why did I even see this?  (just to make an idle point, I DID like "Toy 
Story," but that was good)  Also, I have this aversion to bad French 
farces, and if they remake them into American films.  Well, this is my 
excuse: it was prom night, I'm not a prom person, my best friend and I 
impulsively went to the Drive-Ins where they were playing "Grosse Pointe 
Blank" - wouldn't mind seeing it again - but I had to suffer through 
this first.  I agreed to go.  Ugh.</P>
<P>In all fairness, I can say that at least this inane plot wasn't dreamed 
by an American.  It was originally a french film released in America 
under the pseudonym of "Little Indian, Big City" (French title - "Un 
Indien dans la ville").  I stayed away from it like it was limburgher, 
and according to Roger Ebert, that was a good idea.  But I can only 
imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement.</P>
<P>The stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his 
current marriage. Let me clarify: his wife (JoBeth Williams) left him 
years ago, and I mean years - around 13 or so - and went to an island in 
the Carribean or something.  He goes to her to FINALLY get the divorce 
papers signed so he can remarry this...thing (played with an emphasis on 
over-done by Lolita Davidovitch, who is usually good).  She tells him he 
has a son as his boatman goes off.  He meets him, he has a weird name 
(Mimi Seku, I think...or as the bad joke goes - "Mitsubishi" - laugh 
track cue), he knows english, they fish, more bad jokes, pirhanna joke, 
the kid has a pet spider, he makes a promise to take him to the statue 
of liberty...you know the drill.</P>
<P>Now this is where the plot complicates (well, complicates for this one, 
at least): the Fish-Out-of-Water joke switches from Tim Allen on an 
island to his island son in New York City.  Tim is a stock broker and 
his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasn't 
able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is - Martin Short. 
 A russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere (how come in EVERY 
hokey french import, there is a mob?!)  Tim learns a lesson of life from 
his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island 
even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries.  </P>
<P>The story is crap, the jokes are hokey and not really funny, and the 
actors have to struggle to make it interesting.  But the material is so 
fowl that even a rewrite by Quentin Tarantino couldn't help it.  The 
whole time, I kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and 
several more grown people had to do this.  At the end of filming, did 
they all scream out, "We've made a great movie, guys!"  I sure hope not. </P>
<P>Big Question to Get From This Film: why would someone want to remake 
what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if they're just 
going to do it the exact same way?  Huh?  </P>
<P>MY RATING (out of 5): * (for some of the actors' names and a joke or two 
that made me chuckle, I guess...okay, so I really feel bad for it, so I 
only gave it one star)</P>
