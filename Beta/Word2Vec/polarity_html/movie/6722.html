<PRE>                                   METRO
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     One of the stars of METRO was at the press screening.  If you stay
till the end of this review, I'll tell you a unique experience I shared
with her.</P>
<P>     First, I need your help.  As I was counting up the cars being
killed in METRO, I began to wonder: Exactly how many wrecks does it
take to impress today's jaded audiences?  Certainly half a dozen are
not enough, but will a full dozen suffice?  More to the point, at what
count does the number become so ridiculous that the whole exercise
becomes little more than a bad parody of a demolition derby?  Whatever
the number is, METRO exceeded it.  Did you enjoy your holiday turkey?
Would you have liked it more if you had eaten the whole turkey at once?</P>
<P>     Let me confess that I found parts of METRO entertaining in spite
of all of its failings, but TV director Thomas Carter should return to
the medium he knows best.  Here, he subjugates his movie's best parts
to unoriginal, albeit well executed, stunt work.  There is a good story
attempting to get out when it is not buried under the debris left by a
killer cable car.</P>
<P>     The movie opens promisingly.  Hostage negotiator Scott Roper,
played with considerable style by Eddie Murphy, has his hands full.
A crazed man has seventeen hostages held at gun point in a bank.  The
man's wild eyes testify to his edginess.  In walks Scott to negotiate
with him face-to-face.  Through a combination of bravado and
intelligence, Scott gets all of the hostages out alive.</P>
<P>     At this point in the film I was optimistic about its quality.
My faith, however, was misguided since the script by Randy Feldman
(NOWHERE TO RUN and TANGO & CASH) spends little time in hostage
negotiations.  Feldman's forte is choreographing car crashes.</P>
<P>     Feldman does throw in three subplots.  The first has Murphy in
love with Ronnie Tate (Carmen Ejogo).  Ejogo is an incredibly beautiful
woman with a melodious British accent.  Her part is reduced to being
sexy and vulnerable, but she does both with class.  Unfortunately,
every time their romance begins to get interesting and believable, the
director yells "cut," and orders the stuntmen back on the set.  Murphy
plays his character with more compassion that I thought possible for
him so the constantly truncated romance is frustrating to watch.  I
hate it when shows use subplots merely to titillate.</P>
<P>     The second subplot is totally unnecessary and involves Scott's
compulsive gambling.  Scott's habit keeps sidelining the main part of
the movie so he can go watch the ponies.</P>
<P>     The third and most important subplot has Scott breaking in a new
partner named Kevin McCall and played by the numbers by Michael
Rapaport (BEAUTIFUL GIRLS).  This "old pro trains the new hot shot"
idea has been done a hundred times before, and METRO does nothing new
with it.</P>
<P>     In addition to the excessive reliance on action to carry the
movie, there is a problem with the villain.  Michael Wincott (BASQUIAT)
plays jewelry thief and ruthless killer Michael Korda.  The story would
have us believe that he is one of the kill-everyone-in-his-path style
criminals, but Wincott's lack of passion in the role makes him rarely
convincing.</P>
<P>     For reasons that escape me, the movie had more low bass than
JURASSIC PARK.  I guess that the director has been beside too many
teenager's cars and he, like they, equate bass overload with power
and sex appeal.</P>
<P>     In a movie that could have benefited from more humor, Scott does
get one good one-liner.  When he and Ronnie come home from a foreign
film, he complains, "my eyes still hurt from reading that movie."
Well, my ears hurt when I left his.</P>
<P>     Now for the promised story on why this screening was so unusual.
One of the stars of the show was there live and even stayed afterwards
in the lobby so we could meet her.  Now, the piece de resistance.  I
confess to the world that when no one else was looking, I patted her
rear.</P>
<P>     Okay, so she was the dog in the movie, but she was cute and this
was my first such interaction with a star.  The people from "Bow Wow
Productions" were there too and showed what a talented dog they had.
In the movie the dog is owned by Ronnie and appears in quite a number
of scenes.</P>
<P>     METRO runs too long at 1:57.  The movie drags in the slow parts,
and the action sequences go on too long.  The film is rated R.  There
is violence, profanity, brief nudity, but no sex.  The show would be
fine for teenagers.  METRO is too frustrating and tiring to recommend,
but it does have its moments.  I give METRO my rating of average,
which is **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
