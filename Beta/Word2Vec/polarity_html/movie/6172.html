<P>     GET ON THE BUS is the first film since SPEED to spend this much 
time in the cramped interior of a bus.  The budgets of the two movies, 
much like their intentions, couldn't be more different.  The 1994 action 
blockbuster was a major Hollywood undertaking, with significant studio 
backing.  GET ON THE BUS, Spike Lee's smallest-budget feature since his 
early days as a director, was financed exclusively by 15 wealthy, 
influential African-American men, including Danny Glover, Wesley Snipes, 
Will Smith, Robert Guillaume, San Antonio Spurs basketball player 
Charles D. Smith, and attorney Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr.  Each contributed 
$100,000 or $200,000 to the overall $2.4 million used to make the 
picture.</P>
<P>     The Million Man March, which took place on October 16, 1995, was 
arguably the most important display of male black solidarity since the 
'60s.  As depicted in GET ON THE BUS, it was about unity, self-
discovery, and taking responsibility.  Black women were divided in 
opinion about the March -- some thought it was a great idea, others 
found it to be a "sexist, exclusionary" activity.  Many whites didn't 
understand the point of such a massive gathering, and reacted with 
mistrust and fear, especially when they realized that controversial 
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan was the organizer.  </P>
<P>     GET ON THE BUS doesn't attempt to tell the story of the Million Man 
March -- that would be a monumental, epic undertaking.  Instead, it 
investigates the spirit and meaning of the March as seen through the 
eyes of a group of diverse men taking the long bus trip from Los Angeles 
to Washington D.C. for the event.  Lee's primary objective is to reflect 
back and offer a uniquely personal perspective of that single day last 
October.  This viewpoint, which ultimately transcends the movie's flaws, 
is one of the aspects that makes for a worthwhile two hours.  
Unfortunately, many of the bus riders are just variations of stock 
characters.  Neither Lee nor screenwriter Reggie Rock Bythewood crafts 
more than one or two well-realized personalities.  While it's true that 
many of GET ON THE BUS's men are sympathetic, that's more a function of 
good acting than of the uneven script.</P>
<P>     The men who board the "Spotted Owl" bus in South Central LA are 
certainly not all cut from the same mold.  There's Gary (Roger Guenveur 
Smith), a half-white cop who's insecure about his "blackness" and whose 
girlfriend is mad at him for making the trip.  Evan (Thomas Jefferson 
Byrd) and his son, Junior (De'aundre Bonds), are shackled together by 
court order.  "Dog", as Junior calls him, is trying to make up for years 
of absent parenting by taking his reluctant, delinquent offspring to 
this historic event.  Two homosexual lovers, Kyle (Isaiah Washington) 
and Randall (Harry J. Lennix), are in the midst of a breakup.  An up-
and-coming actor, Flip (Andre Braugher), is waiting to hear whether 
he'll get the co-starring role in a new Denzel Washington movie.  Also 
along for the ride are Xavier (Hill Harper), an aspiring film student; 
Jamal (Gabriel Casseus), a reformed gang-banger; and Jeremiah (Ossie 
Davis, in a standout performance), the aging voice of wisdom and 
experience.  The trip has been organized by George (Charles Dutton), and 
the driver is a white Jew named Rick (Richard Belzer).</P>
<P>     Needless to say, there isn't enough screen time to develop these 
stories more than fitfully.  Some get better exposure than others -- 
most notably those of Gary, the light-skinned cop; Jeremiah, the quiet 
man with a poignant past; and the handcuffed father-and-son tandem.  
Conversely, the struggle of the homosexuals to attain acceptance is 
handled in a superficial manner.  The battle lines between gay rights 
supporters and homophobes are clearly established on the bus, with each 
side mouthing the requisite slogans.  Lee doesn't really offer anything 
new as far as the gay black man is concerned, and appears to have 
included this pair primarily as a means of illustrating diversity within 
the community.</P>
<P>     The melodramatic ending, which includes a sermon on unity, is 
excessively manipulative.  And there are several instances throughout 
when Lee uses contrived events to advance the plot (the bus runs off the 
road, a black Republican comes on board, a fight breaks out).  Still, 
all things considered, GET ON THE BUS presents an involving, intimate 
portrait of a group of men gathered for a common purpose.  Artificial 
plot devices don't divert our attention from the strong, heartfelt 
performances.</P>
<P>     What is occasionally distracting, however, is Elliot Davis' 
camerawork, which includes frequent changes in film stock and lighting 
levels.  Apparently, Lee thinks this is artistic, but it's also 
intrusive.  This kind of film making technique is fine for experimental 
and art features, but, for a drama, its pulls the viewer away from the 
characters, momentarily creating an unwanted awareness of the process 
that's telling the story.  </P>
<P>     Some moments in GET ON THE BUS cut to the heart of what the Million 
Man March symbolized.  One such occasion has the characters singing an 
improvised "Roll Call", introducing themselves to each other in song.  
Another is an intense confrontation between Gary and Jamal about street 
violence, a topic that has a deep, personal meaning for each of them.  
Scenes like these, ripe with genuine emotion, are the most compelling 
reason to take this trip with director Spike Lee and his talented cast.</P>
