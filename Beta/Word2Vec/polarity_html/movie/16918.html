<P>     I don't think I want to know what Andrew Kevin Walker dreams about.
As to Joel Schumacher's dreams, I think I can venture a pretty good guess.
Walker is the scribe responsible for the monumentally disturbing SEVEN, a
writer who seems far too fascinated with the horrifying outer limits of
human depravity; Schumacher is a pop filmmaker who has served up glossy
pseudo-character studies on vigilantism (FALLING DOWN, A TIME TO KILL) and
fetishized beefcake (the two most recent BATMAN extravaganzas).  It would
seem that the creative sensibilities of these two men couldn't be farther
apart, which is one of the reasons 8MM feels like an edgy, intriguing
missed opportunity.  Every time Walker tries to drive the narrative into
the realm of the unnerving, Schumacher drags it back into the merely
kinky.</P>
<P>     The premise for 8MM involves that most enduring of pornographic urban
legends, the snuff film.  Private investigator Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage)
is hired by the widow of a recently deceased billionaire industrialist
regarding one unpleasant item from his wall safe.  It's a single reel of
8mm film, a film in which a teenage girl appears to be knifed to death by
a man in a black leather hood.  Charged by his employer to find out
whether or not the film is authentic, Welles begins to delve into the
Hollywood pornography underworld with a book store clerk named Max
(Joaquin Phoenix) as his guide.  Soon he discovers that there is always
someone willing to cater to almost every sexual taste, and that there are
people in the world capable of things he never imagined.</P>
<P>     Cage is a great choice for a character like Tom Welles -- the
capacity for lunatic action always seems to hide just behind his placid
features -- but the character himself is something of a puzzle.  Much is
made in the opening minutes of Tom's happy marriage to his wife (Catherine
Keener) and his love for his infant daughter, which makes it a bit too
obvious that his quest for the snuff film's possible victim is really all
about his own little girl.  At times, however, it seems that Walker and
Schumacher are playing with the idea that Welles is recognizing some of
his own darker desires through his experience.  Is 8MM a story of a man
discovering the evil in society, or the evil in himself?  If that question
had been answered more effectively, 8MM might have struck a more resonant
chord.</P>
<P>     As it stands, it's still a pretty gripping little thriller at times.
The first hour pokes along at something of a crawl, which somehow works
more often than it doesn't, perhaps because it's indicative of Welles'
tenacity.  The supporting performances are solid, with Joaquin Phoenix
making a savvy sidekick for Welles, and Peter Stormare seething sleaze as
a porn film director.  The deliberate pacing eventually gives way to some
tense showdowns as the film builds to its climax, including a search for a
killer in which the driving sound of thrash metal music suddenly becomes
the eerie metronome of the runout groove.  8MM is rarely a bore, and often
finds the slick energy of the most effective dark action films.</P>
<P>     It's too bad that slickness works against 8MM nearly as often as it
works for it.  The bleak triumph of SEVEN came not primarily through
Walker's fairly straightforward serial killer script, but through director
David Fincher's brilliantly subliminal direction; the violence lurked at
the edges of the frame, where our minds put gruesome pieces together.
Joel Schumacher is a more grandiose sort of filmmaker, one who has no
problem thrusting the details of an S&M film into the dead center of the
screen.  His version of the smoky basements where the hardcore deviants
lurk is too literal, and indeed there's something about Tom Welles' entire
journey that is too literal.  The director isn't exactly trying to
titillate the audience, but he's not helping the writer's study of how one
man responds to the destruction of innocence.  It may be enough that 8MM
is just a decently constructed thriller.  It's just not a gut-rattler,
more the sort of thing you get when the director of BATMAN & ROBIN tries
to do apocalyptic menace.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 film strips:  6.</PRE>
