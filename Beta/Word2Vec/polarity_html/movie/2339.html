<PRE>                                 CABIN BOY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Chris Elliott, Ritch Brinkley, James Gammon, Brian
Doyle-Murray, Brion James, Melora Walters.
Screenplay/Director:  Adam Resnick.</P>
<P>     A couple of years ago, Chris Elliot and writer/director Adam
Resnick teamed up for a Fox television series called "Get a Life" which
lasted, oh, about three weeks.  I enjoyed its silly humor, but if the
microscopic ratings were any indication, the audience for Elliott's fey
goofball character was severely limited.  It's therefore hard to figure
why a studio would green-light a project like CABIN BOY, particularly
assuming anyone actually saw a script before shooting started.  CABIN
BOY is dumb even by the standards of a Chris Elliott project, depending
almost entirely on Elliott's dopey grin and taking far too long to get
to anything with any real wit.</P>
<P>     Elliott plays Nathanial Mayweather, an obnoxious and overly-
sheltered lad just out of prep school.  Looking for the ship which will
take him to his father's Hawaiian hotel, he instead mistakenly ends up
on board The Filthy Whore, a fishing boat with a considerably less
cultured crew:  Captain Greybar (Ritch Brinkley); Skunk (Brian
Doyle-Murray); Paps (James Gammon); and Big Teddy (Brion James).  The
salty fishermen are none-too-pleased with their prissy stowaway, but
they're even less pleased when he inadvertently causes the ship to end
up in Hell's Bucket.  There many dangers await, which Nathanial must
overcome to win the respect of his new comrades and the love of the
girl he pulls out of the ocean (Melora Walters) ... who, incidentally was
trying to set a world record for swimming across the ocean.</P>
<P>     CABIN BOY gets off to a bad start from which it never really
recovers.  This includes a prologue at the prep school which seems to
last about twice as long as the ten minutes it actually is.  Elliott
adopts a supremely annoying quasi-Brahmin accent that makes most of his
dialogue grating, and makes about twelve jokes too many based on
Nathanial's condescension toward common folk.  Then we get a bizarre
cameo by David Letterman, which is almost funny simply for its bald
refusal to disguise his regular TV personality.  In a film which runs
under eighty minutes, a tedious set-up is more than a hindrance ...
it's a pre-emptive first strike.</P>
<P>     Once CABIN BOY hits open water (or at least as open as it gets on
the sound stage), it's no longer actively annoying.  It's also not much
more funny.  Elliott's schtick always tends to the surreal, but as
weird as things get, they remain curiously uninteresting.  Among the
loopy perils of Hell's Bucket are a stop-motion living glacier, a giant
appliance salesman and a half-man/half-shark called Chocki (played by
Russ Tamblyn).  If any of that sounds funny on paper, well, it did to
me, too.  It's the execution that fails.  While the bargain basement
production values might be endearing to some, I found the visual gags
in CABIN BOY painfully unfunny.  Some of the verbal bits work, but in
their rarity I hesitate to spoil them.</P>
<P>     I think one of the main reasons CABIN BOY comes up short is that
it is so obviously a Chris Elliott vanity project.  The four fishermen
are virtually interchangeable characters; not one of them is given a
distinct comic personality out of which some humor could arise.  There
is a glimpse of what could have been in the character of the impossibly
dense first cabin boy, who has a few brief scenes worth a chuckle or
two, but he soon disappears.  Melora Walters as Trina is only asked to
react, which is fortunate because she has about as much presence as a
slight breeze.  Almost every punch line is Elliott's, and a little of
him can go a very long way.  His comic vision is certainly unique, and
viewers perfectly attuned to a mind that concocts a giant talking
cupcake that spits tobacco might have much more fun with CABIN BOY than
I had.  However, I suspect a larger percentage will find it slow going,
and exceedingly short on solid laughs.</P>
<P>     Like caviar, Chris Elliott is an acquired taste.  Also like
caviar, he should probably only be digested in very small portions.
CABIN BOY was just too much for me to swallow.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 talking cupcakes:  3.</PRE>
