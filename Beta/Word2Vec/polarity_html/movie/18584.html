<P>     Is THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE, Mike Figgis' experimental non-linear
tone poem, pretentious?  Of course it is -- you've got to have a healthy
streak of pretentiousness in you to break free from conventional narrative
structure and make something so distinct that it's occasionally
confounding.  Perhaps a better question is whether THE LOSS OF SEXUAL
INNOCENCE is nothing _but_ pretentious.  Even more so than in most films,
the answer to that question will be an eye-of-the-beholder proposition.
Some will see little more than insufferable, gratuitous, iconoclastic
noodling.  Others will see a film that grips you with many of its images
even as it keeps you at an artistic arm's length.</P>
<P>     Though there is no structured "story" to THE LOSS OF SEXUAL
INNOCENCE, there is a focal point in the character of Nic, seen at various
formative stages of his life.  As an adolescent (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), he
has his first fumbling sexual experiences; as an adult (Julian Sands), he
struggles with a marriage to a wife (Kelly Macdonald) as full of doubts as
he is.  Much of the film deals with Nic's work as an ethnographic
film-maker, working with a crew in a remote African location, while
another sub-plot spins us off into the world of twins (Saffron Burrows)
separated at birth.  And serving as a bridge between all these episodes is
an impressionistic rendering of the Eden story, following the experiences
of Adam (Femi Ogumbanjo) and Eve (Hanne Klintoe).</P>
<P>     What may appear from that description to be a fragmented film
actually feels surprisingly cohesive.  Figgis maintains a consistent tone
for his various images, creating a collection of cinematic short stories
as thematically connected as Hemingway's _A Moveable Feast_.  The piano
music of Schumann and Chopin trades places with Figgis' own compositions,
accentuating some magical cinematography by Benoit Delhomme.  If you allow
yourself to get lost in THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE, and avoid succumbing
to the temptation to figure out what everything "means," it can wash over
your resistance to its unconventionality.  Some of the individual stories,
like a chance meeting between the twins, pack an emotional wallop; some of
the individual visions, like a golden landscape that dissolves into the
ripples of a water reflection, are breathtakingly unforgettable.</P>
<P>     And, to be frank, some of it is just plain weird.  In one sequence,
we are shown the dreams of Nic and his wife.  Instead of giving us a view
of an inner life, the scenes play out like a parody of dream images, full
of dissonant music and shifting realities like a years-too-late outtake
from "Twin Peaks."  Most baffling and annoying to some will be the Garden
of Eden sequences, which conspicuously match a transluscently Nordic Eve
with a strikingly black Adam, both of whom are fully nude in every scene.
There's nothing particularly revelatory about Figgis' account of the Fall
but his interracial First Parents, nothing visually compelling in his
unblinking staredown with innocence personified.  By the time the tale
closes with an absurd vision of paparazzi chasing the now-fallen pair
outside the gates of Paradise, it all starts to look more like a Calvin
Klein ad than a cinematic experiment.</P>
<P>     That's the level on which THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE is bound to
set to itching those who can't stand it when their art looks this
in-your-face art-y.  There are times when Figgis' efforts grow wearying in
their lack of basic resonance with the viewer's experiences.  There are
also times when he hits the nail spectacularly on the head, and times when
the film works on an almost symphonic level.  Mike Figgis wants to use the
cinema the way only cinema can be used, and without question he does so.
The extent to which this mixed bag of mourning and memory succeeds is a
matter for _extremely_ subjective analysis.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Paradise losses:  6.</PRE>
