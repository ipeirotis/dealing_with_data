<PRE>                                  CATWALK
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<PRE>              In the spring and fall of each year the major
         fashion designers preview their collections.  This
         is one model's journey through the three weeks of
         Milan, Paris, and New York.

<P>     Last year there was a much better documentary called UNZIPPED that
focused in on the marvelous and naturally funny fashion designer Isaac
Mizrahi.  This year we have a documentary called CATWALK that follows
supermodel Christy Turlington through her paces.  It even includes some
scenes with Mizrahi.  Cinematographer Robert Leacock takes his first
stab at directing, and his inexperience shows.  His approach to
directing is just to shoot a lot of film and then assemble it later in
the cutting room.  This movie has no visible construction and is merely
an assemblage of random pieces of film.  On the good side, if you can
ignore the amateurism documentary style, the fashion industry is always
a weird and fascinating world to visit.</P>
<P>     Beside Christy, we get to meet her friends in the modeling
profession, especially Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss.  If these names do
not mean a lot to you, perhaps you don't subscribe to the right
magazines.  Although I saw UNZIPPED as well as every episode of "The
House of Eliott," I found I learned some from watching CATWALK.  Most
of all, I found out how divorced from reality these people seem to be.
Remember they are selling clothes, which is something we all purchase
and wear, but most of their collections seem destined for some other
planet.  Almost all of them border on self-parody.</P>
<P>     To be fair, a few of the gowns are quite lovely, but most are not,
and the makeup and hairdos these models are forced to wear are
frequently atrocious.  One time, for example, they had to wear about 3
feet of false hair on the their heads.  It had roughly the shape of a
pagoda and had enough hairspray on it to withstand a hurricane force
wind.</P>
<P>     The documentary was done by letting the camera roll and recording
what happened.  There is no narration nor any attempt at a theme.  Back
in the cutting room, they arranged the film strips in order and perhaps
threw some away.  Given they kept an uninteresting sequence where the
camera was dropped, and we toured the floor, perhaps there was no
editing, just splicing.  Unless you follow the fashion world closely,
you will probably be just as confused as I was as to who was who, and
what they were talking about.  Sometimes the camera would start rolling
in the middle of a conversation, and without the context what they were
saying little sense.</P>
<P>     If you've ever wondered what is the value in a million dollar
model, the movie answers the question.  Valentino says, "You can't
always tell at a good collection what a model does, but you sure can at
a bad one.  You put a gunnysack or galoshes on Naomi, and you
understand why a model gets paid."  In sharp contrast to the models,
the fashion designers who come on stage at the end of the unveiling of
their collections are almost always poorly dressed.  It is almost as if
they are trying to look like slobs to show their independence of the
fashion industry that makes them so wealthy.</P>
<P>     In some of the scenes the designers reflect on other designers.
Andre leon Talley says of famous designer John Galliano's collections
that, "He's not making clothes for women who work.  He is making
clothes for women who want to be women."  In other scenes, the models
reflect on themselves.  Kate Moss, talking of their long breaks between
runway walks says, "We have plenty of empty time to think.  That is why
we are so smart."  This film showed no evidence of this occurring.
Most of the models seemed to be on a constant lark without a care or a
thought in the world.</P>
<P>     Since the show is mainly visuals with snippets of conversation, it
forces you to look at the models more and listen to the music.  The
models have a definite homogeneity to them.  They all had big lips, big
eyes, ultrasmooth skin, thin shapes, and small noses.  This reminded me
of the recent Newsweek article on the "Science of Beauty."  Finally,
the music was heavy on the classical like Beethoven's Ode to Joy so I
found this part quite pleasurable.</P>
<P>     CATWALK runs 1:34.  The runway scenes are in color, but the rest
of the film is shot in low contrast black and white.  It is not rated
but would probably get an R rating for its couple of uses of the F
word.  Actually, it is a film with very brief nudity, no sex, no
violence, and mainly very mild language so I think kids as young as 10
could go.  The most offensive thing to me was the models' constant
smoking.  Although I enjoyed the show, the poor quality of the
production is too much of an annoyance for me to be able to recommend
it.  I give it **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
