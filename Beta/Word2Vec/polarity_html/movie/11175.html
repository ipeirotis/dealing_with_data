<PRE>ANIMAL HOUSE (1978)
                       a review by Justin Siegel</PRE>
<P>**** out of **** for this full-on hardcore manly shit.</P>
<P>NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE, made in 1978 and set in 1962, remains 
one of the -- no, fuck that noise -- *the* funniest movie ever made. And 
this isn't just my opinion, either; everybody knows this, and that's why 
about a gazillion inferior rip-offs have been made, trying to duplicate 
its success. (PCU anyone? And the first person to bring up GLORY DAZE 
gets decked.)</P>
<P>ANIMAL HOUSE takes place at the fictional Faber College, circa 1962, 
where the Omega frat calls the shots. These guys are wholesome, 
clean-cut, model-citizens... i.e. a bunch of assholes. Greg, their 
leader, is going out with Mandy Pepperidge, but since the silly bastard 
doesn't believe in pre-marital sex, their relationship never goes further 
than a quick jack-off under the stars. Neidermeyer is the supreme-bozo of 
the bunch, walking around with his dick out kicking freshman ass and 
trying to impress the muff. Also hanging around these losers is Babs, 
future Universal Studios employee and serious bitch.</P>
<P>Now let's just take a peak next door, at the Delta house. Over here, 
anything goes: you wanna throw shit out the window? Okay. You wanna crush 
a bunch of beer cans on your forehead and pour honey-mustard all over 
your chest? Go right ahead. The frat's leaders are Otter and Boon (Tim 
Matheson and Peter Riegert). Otter is the ladies' man, going out with 
another girl every night, and Boon is the comedian. He's got a 
steady-date, Katy (Karen Allen), but she's sick of playing second-fiddle 
to a bottle of J.D.</P>
<P>THen there are the others: Pinto, a wimp; Flounder, a blimp; D. Day, a 
biker; Stork, who may or may not have brain-damage; and last but not 
least... Bluto! Bluto, played by the late, great John Belushi, is the 
man. He's the kind of guy who slugs back entire fifths of whiskey then 
proclaim, "I needed that." The kind of guy who puts a cream-filled 
Snowball into his mouth, puffs up his cheeks and spits it out, and then 
says "I'm a zit -- get it?"</P>
<P>The story is as follows: The Omegas are getting the Deltas kicked off 
campus. The Deltas, knowing that fighting the Omegas is stupid, decide to 
go out with style, throwing a wild Toga party and ruining the 
homecoming parade.</P>
<P>This is the fucnniest movie int he history of the world. Do yourself a 
favor and go see it.</P>
