<P>     Throughout much of her early motion picture career, the term that 
perhaps best described Meg Ryan's characters was "the girl next door."  
You remember WHEN HARRY MET SALLY and SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, her two 
biggest hits, in which she played a long-haired, sweet, slightly-
insecure, easily likable young woman.  Lately, however, Ryan has been 
trying to change her image.  To be fair, she has always exhibited more 
range that she has been given credit for (witness her triple performance 
in JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO or her gender-bender in PRELUDE TO A KISS), 
but most directors have been happy to stick her into a formula and let 
her effervesce.  Now, after a dramatic stint in COURAGE UNDER FIRE, Ryan 
is back in another romantic comedy; however, this is no featherweight 
boy-meets-girl tale, and her character, Maggie, is no Sally.</P>
<P>     Maggie is a bad girl, although not quite as bad as she'd like 
everyone to believe.  She wears her hair short and unkempt, travels 
around the streets of New York on a motorcycle, and prefers donning 
anything in black that exposes her navel.  She talks tough and her eyes 
are hard little agates, except when she's alone and a softer side comes 
to the surface (Ryan does a good job showing this in mostly-subtle ways, 
such as the set of Maggie's shoulders).  Why is she so abrasive?  
Because her currently mission in life is revenge -- revenge against the 
ex-fiancee, Anton (Tcheky Karyo), who cast her aside when he found his 
latest paramour, Linda (Kelly Preston).</P>
<P>     Linda happens to have been the lifelong love of small-town 
astronomer Sam (Matthew Broderick).  When ADDICTED TO LOVE opens, we're 
shown a slice of his idyllic life (complete with a number of irritating 
technical inaccuracies about the abilities of a telescope) -- how he has 
a job he loves and a woman he adores.  But Linda is restless, and she 
decides to take a two-month trip to New York City.  While there, she 
meets Anton, falls in love, and moves in with him.  When Sam learns the 
truth via a "Dear John" letter, he gets on the next flight to the Big 
Apple.</P>
<P>     In New York, he sets up home in abandoned building across the 
street from the apartment shared by Linda and Anton, and constructs a 
camera obscura to watch their every movement (his voyeurism recalls the 
likes of REAR WINDOW and STAKEOUT).  Soon, Maggie joins him in his 
"bohemian hellhole," bringing along bugging equipment so they can have 
sound in addition to video.  Together, the two hatch a plan to break 
apart the new lovers -- Sam, so he can win back Linda, and Maggie, so 
she can see Anton "in pain, hopeless, and finished off."  </P>
<P>     Despite some totally unnecessary, minor believability issues (for 
example, a telescope that can pick out faint stars during daylight hours 
and a truck that's allowed to ride alongside a plane down a runway), 
ADDICTED TO LOVE boasts a smart, sassy script that risks showing its 
protagonists doing some exceptionally nasty things.  Some of Sam and 
Maggie's schemes are vicious, and there are times when we find ourselves 
feeling sorry for their unfortunate victims.</P>
<P>     If there's a sense of Martin Scorsese's AFTER HOURS here, it's no 
coincidence.  The director, Griffin Dunne (working from a script by 
Robert Gordon), was the star of that film, and he appears at home 
putting a seemingly-normal man in increasingly-bizarre circumstances.  
And, while it's obvious to even the most obtuse viewer that Sam and 
Maggie are going to end up together at the end, there are enough clever 
turns along the way to keep us interested.  Their romance really forms 
the coda to a deliciously nasty, dark comedy.</P>
<P>     Opposite Ryan, Broderick is effective as the average Joe who 
becomes wrapped up in Maggie's Machiavellian schemes, until he hatches a 
few gems of his own.  And, while Sam and Maggie don't strike too many 
sparks as a couple, they're both likable, and, together, they develop a 
nice camaraderie.  International star Tcheky Karyo (LA FEMME NIKITA) and 
Kelly Preston (last seen in JERRY MAGUIRE) are effective, if a little 
underused, as the film's second pairing.  Maureen Stapleton has a 
supporting turn as Maggie's aunt.</P>
<P>     ADDICTED TO LOVE isn't likely to ascend to the lofty box office 
pinnacle attained by Ryan's WHEN HARRY MET SALLY or SLEEPLESS IN 
SEATTLE, but it probably won't fall to the depths of I.Q. or FRENCH 
KISS.  It's kind of fun seeing the actress suppress her usual mannerisms 
and do the grunge thing, but not nearly as enjoyable as it is immersing 
oneself in Dunne's bizarre-yet-oddly-engaging romantic comedy about 
voyeurism, moldy strawberries, and monkeys wearing lipstick.  ADDICTED 
TO LOVE is for those who don't mind a world view that's a little askew, 
yet who can still accept that love conquers all.</P>
