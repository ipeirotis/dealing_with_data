<PRE>THE SIEGE</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *** out of ****</PRE>
<P>A frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a
common criminal.  A soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one
nation-state against another.  A common criminal commits acts of violence
for personal gain.  A terrorist employs random violence as a means to a
political end.  If the target nation does not affect the desired change in
policy, the violence continues.  It is the fear resulting from the fact that
the terrorist may strike at anyone (even total innocents), anywhere, at
anytime that gives the figure his label.  Edward Zwick's THE SIEGE explores
the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the
United States.</P>
<P>You'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines.  Arab
terrorists kill American citizens abroad, and the U.S. responds by
retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack.  However,
unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against Bin Laden's camp
and manufacturing facility, the film version depicts special operations
troops kidnapping Sheik Ahmed Bin Talal.  In retaliation, the terrorists
bring the fight to the New World.  Unwittingly involved is FBI Assistant
Special Agent-in-Charge Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington), who works out
of the Bureau's New York office at One Federal Plaza.  While investigating a
series of bombings in the Big Apple, he encounters CIA agent Elise Kraft
(Annette Bening), also trying to uncover information.  Generally, the FBI is
charged with problems inside the U.S., while the CIA takes care of problems
in the international realm.  Even spies from other countries are off limits
to the CIA as long as they are in our country.  Hubbard therefore finds it
highly unusual that an Agency spook is nosing around what he considers his
territory, but as the two form a tentative professional relationship,
Hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of
allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the United
States government.</P>
<P>The original tagline for PATRIOT GAMES was, "There has never been a
terrorist attack on American soil."  However true, it was pulled before the
movie's release because it sounded too much like a dare.  Revisiting the
scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the United
States, THE SIEGE is almost an invitation in itself, because it shows just
what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network
were to set up operations here in America.  Admittedly, the terror wrought
upon New York is a bit excessive (who's going to believe that a few bombs
are going to cause New Yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to
curtail their shopping by two-thirds?), but the basic premise is still valid.</P>
<P>I liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare
of good guy G-Men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the
effects on society and law and order.  It provides a very possible
hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few Arabs would escalate
into a series of hate crimes against the Arab-American population, and that
in an effort to find the terrorists, the civil liberties of the minority may
be violated by the government itself.  In fact, about halfway through the
film, when the President authorizes the declaration of martial law within
New York City, the liberties of all Americans are put at risk.  Although it
may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign, the demise of social
order in America is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath
many international terrorist groups.</P>
<P>Throughout, the film maintains a conflict between Hubbard, who wants to use
the FBI to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law, and General
Devereaux (Bruce Willis), who is in command of the army and of the mind that
the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing
the terrorists more forcefully.  What results is a fascinating debate over
the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law
and the invocation of the War Powers Act, utilizing philosophy and
historical examples to make points on both sides.  It actually gets rather
heady at times, but it's a credit to screenwriters Zwick, Lawrence Wright,
and Menno Meyjes that they don't underestimate the intelligence of the audience.</P>
<P>I don't know if it's his tone or inflection or something else, but Denzel
Washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says
sound great.  This, combined with his innate acting ability and his
experience in playing the mid-level authority figure, makes his performance
in THE SIEGE convincing and enjoyable.  Annette Bening gives one of the more
assertive portrayals of a female character I've seen recently, and the
chemistry she shares with Washington is palpable.  It's somewhat unfortunate
that her character's fortitude is broken at a certain point, but it allows
us to watch Bening play a little more range.  Bruce Willis is pretty much
relegated to a tough-guy role, always standing straight, and with a
permanent scowl fixed upon his face.  However, the tension that exists
between Devereaux and Hubbard is a major drive behind the film's
development.  Notable is Tony Shalhoub who plays FBI Agent Frank Haddad, a
Lebanese immigrant.  The role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial
pride for his heritage, and contempt for those of his own race who might
interfere with his integration into the American society.  Difficult to say
the least, Shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and
touch.  Perhaps best known for his role as Antonio the cab driver in the NBC
sitcom "Wings," Shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the
wonderful film BIG NIGHT.</P>
<P>Whereas Denzel Washington seems to be Edward Zwick's favorite actor (he
directed Washington in GLORY and COURAGE UNDER FIRE), James Horner seems to
be his favorite composer.  I therefore found it odd that Zwick chose the
prolific score-writer Graeme Revell (seven films this year already) over
Horner for THE SIEGE until I realized that this film contained a lot of
Arabian-themed music, and Horner's record has shown more of a propensity for
scores either neutral in ethnicity or Irish-sounding at most.  Revell does a
good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing
the score to enhance the movie as a whole.  It's nowhere near as intrusive
as in some of the other films we've been getting throughout the year.</P>
<P>Missteps in THE SIEGE can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes.
For example, it's pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more
of thriller than an action flick.  Unfortunately, there's a scene where the
army just cuts loose against some Arab immigrants in a blatant display of
firepower and explosions, obviously meant for the sole purpose of being
eye-catching.  In the middle of the city (and against no real opposition),
Zwick even has the army use a Cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into
a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops.  Verisimilitude
really goes out the window at that point.  The film also gets a little
preachy toward the end, focusing on the ability of different races to get
along.  A noble gesture, the film just puts the message across a bit too
obviously.  These flaws are glaring, but they don't detract too much from an
otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have
considered since history class.</P>
