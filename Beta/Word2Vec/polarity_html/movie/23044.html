<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A neat noir thriller that has a slight variation on the "Double
Indemnity" theme, this time it is the guy who is the seducer. This is a
Joseph Losey American film, made before his self-exile from the 1950s
HUAC witch-hunt days when he fled to England, and as it is the
director's want, social issues and class differences will play a major
role in the motif, adding to the usual noir ones of dark character and
sexual misconduct. Dalton Trumbo, the blacklisted writer, is the
uncredited cowriter of the script.</P>
<P>The film opens with a beautiful framing shot of a woman in the window
screaming as she sees a prowler. The patrol car partners respond and
come to a luxurious Spanish-styled house, in an affluent neighborhood.
The caller is an attractive and frightened woman, Susan Gilvray (Keyes),
who saw someone peering into her window after she came out from her
bath. The two officers, the bespectacled veteran Bud Crocker (Maxwell)
and the much younger but less civil cop, Webb Garwood (Van Heflin),
question her and give her some safety tips to avoid having the prowler
return. There is one arresting shot of Webb peering into the same window
the same way the prowler did and eliciting the same response from Mrs.
Gilvray as before. This is a sign of what's to come, as Webb will take
the place of the prowler, as he slowly manuevers his way into Susan's
life and starts an affair that will result in a tragic outcome.</P>
<P>Bud is a married man who has never fired his gun after 20 years on the
force, whose interest lies in collecting rocks in the desert and in
visiting ghost towns. His wife doesn't care too much for Webb because he
isn't proud to be a cop, as he feels that he is a failure after being a
high school basketball star in Indiana who came to California on a
basketball scholarship, but couldn't catch a break when his coach
withdrew that scholarship and he had to take this job, which he
considers demeaning. She also senses he is disinterested in hearing what
Bud has to say about his hobby.</P>
<P>Finding Susan to be attractive and wealthy, his interest in her is
peaked. He goes back to her place and strikes up a cordial conversation,
discovering that they are both Hoosiers, though she is from an exclusive
neighborhood and he's from the other side of the tracks. He thought that
she was single and is disappointed to find out that her husband John
(Sherry) is an all-night radio talk show personality, whom she listens
to because he questions her about the program afterwards. His trademark
signal at the end of his show is, "I'll be seeing you Susan." This is
particularly annoying for Webb, as he calls his voice oily.</P>
<P>Webb can't contain himself any longer, realizing that she is a lonely
woman who doesn't love her wealthy husband, and becomes sexually
aggressive with her, which she resists by slapping him a few times and
telling him to never come back. But the resilient Webb comes back in
uniform with a seemingly sincere apology and the two get together, and
the affair begins, with her boredom replaced with sexual ecstasy. Webb
tells her that he wants more than this affair, he wants her as his wife,
but he knows he will need money to support someone who is used to living
in luxury.</P>
<P>After his vacation in Las Vegas, where he dreams of bettering himself
financially in life and becoming a motel owner, he cooks up an ingenuous
scheme to get rid of her husband, after having poked around the
Gilvray's house and discovered that in his will he has left a small
fortune to Susan.</P>
<P>After dropping Bud off when their patrol is over, he will go to Susan's
house and cut the screen door, making it appear as if a prowler is
there. The Gilvrays call the police and he is sent to investigate that
report. To get John to come out again with his pistol, he makes some
noise around the house and when John comes out, he manages to shoot him,
making it look accidental, even taking John's pistol and winging his arm
with it.</P>
<P>Susan is repelled by him, believing he killed her husband. But in the
coroner's jury it is ruled as an accident. There's a great shot at the
end of the inquest, when Webb is exonerated and all the men in blue come
up to congratulate him. The resilient Webb, quits the police force after
that, saying the accident shook him up and he will never handle a gun
again. But he is now closed out of Susan's life, so he goes to John's
brother, William (Treacy), who is satisfied with the jury's verdict and
willing to see Webb, even mentioning that his brother was a tough one to
live with and he knows he didn't get along that well with Susan. Webb
asks him to give Susan his life savings of $700, to help her out in case
she needs some money. This effort to elicit sympathy for himself works,
as William pushes them together and they soon decide to get married.</P>
<P>Webb is now as happy as he's ever been in life, he's got his woman, her
money, and a motel in Las Vegas. But she tells him that she is four
months pregnant and the wheels start to spin in the hard-luck Webb's
head. He knows that John is sterile and that they haven't been married
long enough for the child to be perceived as his. Fearing that he will
be charged with the murder and Susan as his accomplice, he talks her
into going to one of Bud's ghost towns in the Mojave Desert and she
talks him into being the deliverer of the baby.</P>
<P>The desolation of the desert, where there isn't a neighbor for miles,
brings out a certain peace in them, even though they are living in a
rundown shack. But by mistake, they hear a recording of John's radio
program, including his trademark goodnight to Susan, which breaks the
jubilant mood and sets the dismal one to come.</P>
<P>When complications arise in her birth, Webb says he will go into town to
get a doctor. But Susan sees him pack his gun and it dawns on her that
she is living with a murderer and that he will kill the doctor.</P>
<P>The doctor delivers the baby, but in a conversation with her husband,
she gets him to admit that he married her to get the money in the will.
Susan is able to warn the doctor of the danger he is in and he flees in
his car with the baby. Webb has no choice but to flee alone, back to
ground zero in his life, as the last frame of the film shows him running
into his past, as he meets Bud on the road, whom he angrily tells to get
out of his way when trapped in the one lane road leading out of the
desert, as he runs away from Bud and the police who have just arrived
and tries to climb a sand dune, but the police shoot him just as he
crawls his way to the top.</P>
<P>"The Prowler" shows the underside to the American dream and its
all-American antihero, the milk drinking, status seeking Van Heflin, a
law enforcer of the establishment but who is himself the abuser of
power; and in contrast, his lonely, security seeking bride, Evelyn
Keyes, who wants the same material things as he does, but is willing to
sacrifice her need for material things for love.</P>
<P>The reason Van Heflin got away with the initial crime, is because he is
one of the boys, his image as a clean-cut, white American, the ruling
class in the social structure, stops others from questioning his use of
power. As for the contemptuous Van Heflin, who really has a disregard
for others, his love for Keyes was real but not enough for him, he had
to also have the superficial material things of life to satisfy his weak
ego. That is the bad break he made for himself and the reason he went
over-the-edge. These two stars gave superb performances in this
arresting thriller that is scripted with a social conscience and a taut
sense of reality.</P>
