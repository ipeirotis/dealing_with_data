<P>     As I sat in my car twenty minutes after the conclusion of THE
HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, tears still welling up in my eyes, I though about
what made me respond to Disney's recent animated hits, even flawed
efforts like POCAHONTAS.  It was not simply animation to which I was
responding, since animated films like BALTO had left me unmoved, and I
like to believe that Disney's ubiquitous marketing had no influence.  I
thought about the moments in films like BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and THE
LITTLE MERMAID which had filled me with the pure joy of film artistry, and
I realized the connection:  music.  THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is dark,
enchanting, visually spectacular and richer in thematic depth than 99% of
the live action films I see, but I know that it was the power of grand
opera which pushed me over the edge.</P>
<P>     Based on Victor Hugo's 1831 classic, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME
tells of Quasimodo (voice of Tom Hulce), the deformed bellringer living in
the tower of Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral.  Raised since infancy by the
cruel Minister of Justice Claude Frollo (Tony Jay), Quasimodo lives a
lonely existence with only the stone gargoyles of the cathedral as his
friends:  Victor (Charles Kimbrough), Hugo (Jason Alexander) and Laverne
(Mary Wickes).  But on the Festival of Fools, Quasimodo decides to venture
into the streets, where he is rescued from an uncaring crowd by the
beautiful gypsy Esmeralda (Demi Moore).  Quasimodo becomes enchanted with
Esmeralda, but a furious Frollo, who considers gypsies evil, demands that
she be arrested and punished.  When Frollo's Captain of the Guard Phoebus
(Kevin Kline) decides to help Esmeralda, Quasimodo finds him a rival for
Esmeralda's affections, but an ally in the struggle to save her from
Frollo's wrath.</P>
<P>     There is no question that computer technology is allowing Disney
animators an ever-increasing freedom, and the opportunity to create some
astonishing images.  There are scenes involving thousands of "extras"
which are simply extraordinary, and a swooping shot as Quasimodo comes to
Esmeralda's rescue which is breath-taking.  Still, the conventional
character animation might be even better.  It seems almost unfair to
single out one star, but I will:  Kathy Zielinski, the character
supervisor for Frollo.  She has designed one of Disney's most complicated
villains ever, a tormented and hateful zealot with a mouth so cruel and
subtly expressive that he makes you want to shudder every time he smiles.
With superb voice work by Tony Jay, Frollo becomes a brilliant
characterization.  If an animator ever deserved credit for a Best
Supporting Actor performance, this might be the case.</P>
<P>     Frollo's tortured soul (revealed in a creepy and very un-Disney-like
song called "Hellfire") is just one of many rather adult subjects which
gives HUNCHBACK a surprising resonance.  Frollo's relationship with
Quasimodo is that of an abusive parent who tears down his child's
self-esteem, then makes him feel grateful because he still takes care of
the child.  Quasimodo's cowering respect for Frollo is heart-breaking,
rendered poignantly by Tom Hulce.  HUNCHBACK also tackles prejudice and
religious hypocrisy, with Esmeralda's entreaty "God Help the Outcasts"
observing that Jesus was "once an outcast too."  There is certainly a fair
amount of comic relief, mostly provided by the gargoyles and the lively
number "A Guy Like You," but if HUNCHBACK is at all a film for children,
it is one which exposes them to issues their parents should be prepared to
discuss.</P>
<P>     The messages in HUNCHBACK are powerful, and they are skillfully
handled, but there is something that happens when they are set to music.
The songs by Alan Menken and Steven Schwartz are not particularly
memorable by Disney standards, nothing you will be humming for days
afterwards like "Be Our Guest" or "Under the Sea," but they are evocative.
A heartfelt sentiment which is sung rather than spoken draws its emotion
from a different place.  Hollywood seems to believe that no one wants to
see a musical in 1996, and that Disney's films are aberrations because
they are animated.  I'm not convinced that the real issue isn't choice of
material.  Disney selects timeless tales, and a timeless tale in song is a
powerful thing.</P>
<P>     There are certainly more than a few similarities between THE
HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (also directed by Kirk
Wise and Gary Trousdale); if it had been live action, I'd have sworn that
they re-used some of the same sets in the opening number.  BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST is a better film, a classic, and yet there I was, twenty minutes
after the conclusion of HUNCHBACK, tears still welling up in my eyes,
emotionally invested in the life of an animated character.  And though the
songs may not have been on my lips, I know they were in my heart.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 belle towers:  9.</PRE>
