<P>     It's hard to believe it has been over two and a half months since the
last volcano movie hit North American screens; it seems like only, gosh,
seven or eight weeks.  20th Century Fox is banking on the fact that lava's
lovelier the second time around, rolling out VOLCANO as an April preview
to the summer movie season, but whether or not it works depends on what
you're looking for in your disaster movies.  DANTE'S PEAK was frequently
dumb and predictable, but it also delivered suspense down the stretch in
well-packaged bursts.  VOLCANO is less chained to convention, a bit more
clever, and boasts a more talented cast.  It is also more about spectacle
than suspense, a very impressive production which is easier to enjoy from
a detached distance than it is to get caught up in.</P>
<P>     Tommy Lee Jones stars as Mike Roark, a supervisor for Los Angeles'
Office of Emergency Management who is supposed to be on vacation with his
daughter Kelly (Gaby Hoffman).  That is before a moderate earthquake hits,
and before an incident involving the death of several utilities workers
suggests an unusual underground heat source.  Seismologist Dr. Amy Barnes
(Anne Heche) has a theory, but no one believes it -- that is, until the La
Brea Tar Pits turn into a fountain of magma spewing destruction all over
Wilshire Boulevard.  As the sea of lava begins its inexorable march, Roark
tries to figure out some way to stop it or re-direct its course.
Meanwhile, Dr. Barnes suggests that there may be another more powerful
eruption yet to come, and tries to figure out where and when it might hit.</P>
<P>     There are certain elements you have come to expect in a film of this
kind, and VOLCANO delivers all of them:  intransigent bureaucrats who end
up making a bad situation worse, a hero whose personal life is given equal
footing with large-scale destruction, pets which make improbable escapes.
Fortunately, the script by Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray offers a few
variations on those themes along the way.  The intransigent bureaucrat,
instead of becoming the guy whose inevitable death is a cause for cheers,
gets a shot at redemption; those amazing animals are given a satirical
poke in a feel-good TV news piece about "the other victims."  The dialogue
sometimes does get stilted and heavy-handed, and a few of the sub-plots
-- including one involving a self-absorbed real estate developer (John
Corbett) -- are abandoned mid-stream without any fanfare.  Apparently
someone realized that a fast pace and minimal exposition make for a better
disaster.</P>
<P>     That doesn't prevent the writers from attempting some clumsy stabs at
social commentary, which are notable largely because they are among the
few attempts at making the film specific to L.A.  As dopey as the tag line
"The Coast is Toast" may be, it showed that the marketing people
understood one of the more appealing elements of VOLCANO's premise:
people want to get a perverse charge out of watching Tinseltown become
Tindertown.  VOLCANO could have used more of a sense of place, more
recognizable landmarks like the Angelyne billboard turned into briquets.
Sure, it's wonderful that racially-fragmented Los Angelenos become one big
ashen can't-we-all-just-get-along family when forced to work together for
the common weal, but be honest.  Wouldn't you rather see lava creeping up
on a trademark L.A. traffic jam or chasing an army of suddenly less mellow
in-line skaters through Santa Monica, instead of crawling like fluorescent
tapioca down Wilshire?</P>
<P>     Which is not to say that the fluorescent tapioca in question isn't
extremely impressive.  In fact, there are a lot of impressive visuals in
VOLCANO, including tactically launched lava bombs and a dizzying array of
explosions.  The pyrotechnicians earn every cent of their pay in VOLCANO,
but the imagery could have been accompanied by more tense set pieces.  One
superb sequence finds Jones and Heche dangling over lava from a fire truck
ladder, while a man lying on the ladder contends with a fire burning its
way up a hose.  However, that's one of the rare moments when anyone seems
to be in any genuine peril.  The lava gets rolling, it destroys a bunch of
buildings, folks try to figure out how to stop it, and then they try to
figure out _another_ way to stop it.  VOLCANO loses a lot of steam after
Mount Wilshire blows her top, but there's just enough magnificent magma to
carry it through until Randy Newman sings "I Love L.A." over the closing
credits.  I love L.A., too, though I might have preferred it even more
well-done.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 lava stories:  6.</PRE>
