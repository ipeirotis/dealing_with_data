MR. DEATH: THE RISE AND FALL OF FRED A. LEUCHTER, JR. (director/writer:
Errol Morris; cinematographer: Peter Donohue; editor: Karen Schmeer;
cast: David Irving, Fred A. Leuchter Jr., James Roth, Shelly Shapiro,
Suzanne Tabasky, Robert Jan Van Pelt, Ernst Zündel, 1999)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Errol Morris's unorthodox documentary is about the son of a
Massachusetts prison superintendent of transportation who grew up in the
prison atmosphere and later on went into the business of upgrading
traditional Death Row equipment, and as his reputation grew among prison
personnel because of his technical skills, so did the amount of business
he procured from the different states all over the country, all with
supposedly antiquated and insufficient killing systems. What makes Fred
A. Leuchter, Jr. a most challenging subject for the documentary
filmmaker: is that the story tries to explore a kind of evil that is
hard to put one's finger on, being that Leuchter is not necessarily an
evil person, but someone whom it is hard to put a label on, yet the
causes that he advances because of his vanity- is evil. His bad
notoriety comes about only when he backs a neo-Nazi group and thereby
forsakes his reputation.</P>
<P>Errol Morris knows what he is after in this film and mines it out of his
resourceful subject. He has found a peculiar kind of individualist in
Leuchter, someone who blindly thinks he knows what the truth is, who
trusts that he couldn't be wrong if he believes something, thereby
shutting off any other means of hearing the truth but through his own
vanity. This hubris is a trait he shares with many idealogues, to a
certain degree. But it is this mania that Leuchter has, that won't be
shaken out of him, that makes him such a compelling study, someone who
appears to be a sincere and mild-mannered man, but despite those
characteristics, he turns out to be a most obstinate fellow, someone who
is driven by his own egomania, willing to fight to his death for what he
believes in.</P>
<P>He is a self-taught engineer by training, who found himself motivated by
his sense of compassion for the need for more efficient and "humane"
execution devices to be invented. He is a tiny, mousy, and loquacious
man, someone who compulsively can't stop talking about what he does for
a living, which lends a dismal sense of perverse comedy for half the
film until his unchecked demeanor began to grate on me and he became
overbearing. He is a lonely and sad soul, someone who craves acceptance,
who is limited only by his lack of insight. It is not hard to think of
him as a twerp, whose expertise in executions seems to be real enough
but who otherwise is a strangely enigmatic man, someone whom it is not
possible to really penetrate. He is someone who disturbingly can't think
straight about things that most any child would have little trouble
with, such as knowing the difference between what is right and wrong.</P>
<P>Who he is, can only be answered by what he does for a living. He is
someone who improved the functioning of the modern electric chair, gave
America a better electric chair helmet, built gas chambers in a more
efficient manner, improved the techniques of the lethal injection by
cutting down on human error, and built a better gallows for hangings by
making a better trapdoor. In other words, like the Nazis who gave
Germany more technical efficiency, he is the perfect imitation of them
in spirit. Yet, he is someone who isn't even aware that he might be a
Nazi, he has so desensitized himself of any sense of moral consciousness
and responsibility for his actions. The filmmaker allows him to be
viewed as he sees himself and how those who were involved with him see
him, and the consensus is, that he is someone who craves the limelight -
even if this attention results in the loss of his career.</P>
<P>I think that he had to know when he joined forces with a neo-Nazi group
what he was doing and what kind of risky political stand he was taking,
and that he would be considered part of that hate group of Holocaust
deniers, that there could be no way he could continue to maintain that
he is not an anti-Semite and be believed. Certainly not by Holocaust
survivors, who are used in the film to tell what they think of him. To
think otherwise, that he is just an innocent fool, would be to deny what
is the obvious. Yet, he is presented as someone who was naively
influenced by the limelight to do what he did and was not motivated by a
political agenda.</P>
<P>Earl Morris makes documentaries about as good as anyone ever has,
tackling subjects that others would shy away from (this being his
seventh feature- some others are-Gates of Heaven/Fast, Cheap & Out of
Control/The Thin Blue Line). His works are not mere biographies or
Hollywood driven achievement celluloids, but poetics of the cinema that
sing to our inner sense of being, that make us think about the life of
the person on film in a way that we most likely wouldn't have thought
about them if we had not seen what Morris saw and presented us with. His
subjects are about those who are considered eccentric because they are
not clones, or clichés, or anything but unique individuals whose
behavior is dictated by their very unusual personal obsessions, no
matter what society might think of the strange path they have taken.
This film is no exception and like the director's other works, it's a
visual testament to the human spirit, warts and all.</P>
<P>Fred Leuchter Jr. is one of those ordinary looking people who is so
driven by complexly different forces in him, that his tale is wracked
with wonderment at how someone could be both a technical genius and such
a damn fool. In an odd way, because of his individualism, he is even
appealing, which makes this a very scary film--as ultimately, it is
about how evil flourishes if it goes unanswered.</P>
<P>The career of Leuchter caught fire when there was a need for the
consultant services he provided the prisons, as not many other
engineers, for mainly moral reasons, wanted to be involved with the
instruments of death. Also, he got most of the prison contracts because
he offered prison officials good prices for his work. Prison officials
didn't quite understand their equipment, which in most cases either was
built by inmates or electricians who didn't have the know-how. In most
prisons, the correct amount of currency it took to kill a prisoner
without making the execution into a torture, was not common knowledge.
As a result, he was esteemed in the community of penal corrections for
his contributions in improving the efficiently of their instruments for
capital punishment, that is, until everything came crashing down on him.</P>
<P>Leuchter is disarming when he is talking with love about the equipment
he put together and how well it works, and how compassionate he is for
those being executed, wishing only for them to have a good execution. He
faces the camera with the crooked smile of a child who doesn't want you
to think badly of him, even if you already know he has put his hand in
the cookie jar and stolen the goods.</P>
<P>His downfall comes, when he is invited by a neo-Nazi group to give them
scientific proof that the gas chambers weren't part of the Holocaust. He
is to be an expert witness at a trial of one of the hate groups'
propagandists, Ernst Zündel, who is on trial for violating Canada's law
forbidding Holocaust denial and for spreading lies that can incite
racial hatred, and by his writing of the Holocaust revisionist pamphlet
entitled "Did Six Million Really Die?" He and his anti-Semite cronies
enlist Leuchter to go to the concentration camps in Poland and gather
evidence that the Holocaust didn't take place and for him to do their
bidding for them to make their group look legitimate in the scientific
community. For anyone in their right mind to believe such garbage, is
beyond comprehension. For anyone to have done what Leuchter did and not
be an anti-Semite himself is, in my opinion, very unlikely. But in the
case of this very strange man, the viewers have a chance to decide for
themselves what Leuchter is all about, after hearing him say he has not
backed the neo-Nazi group because he is a bigot, but he did so because
he believed they were scientifically right in denying the Holocaust.</P>
<P>As a result of the trial, Zundel is found guilty and Leuchter's forensic
reports are found to be unscientific and inaccurate, filled with a
multitude of things he never even evaluated and that the ones he
evaluated were tested in the wrong way. The Dutch concentration camp
historian, Robert Jan Van Pelt, is the real champion of truth in this
film, as he goes into detail how ludicrous Leuchter's so-called research
was and how evil it was for him to go into a place like Auschwitz and
into a crematorium like the infamous number two, where 500,000 Holocaust
victims died, and then have the gall to say that there was no gas
chambers there, when it is evident he didn't know how to test for
cyanide, being that it can only be tested from samples taken on the
surface of the stones, since the gas can't penetrate further. Leuchter's
tests were diluted too much by going into the depths of the walls, where
it would be impossible to find traces of the gas. The historian also
points out how Leuchter never checked the camp records which clearly
showed documentations of gas chambers and ventilation systems.</P>
<P>Leuchter became not just a witness at the trial for neo-Nazis, which is
bad enough, but he also went on the lecture circuit for these Holocaust
denial revisionist groups, enjoying the neo-Nazi groups' affection and
applause. His waitress wife didn't appreciate that he took her for her
honeymoon to the concentration camps and she divorced him soon after
their marriage. The prisons stopped hiring him, which he blames on
Jewish groups putting the pressure on them. He also complains of being
brought up on charges of falsifying his credentials by the state of
Massachusetts. He is pictured as a man who is now walking on a lonely
trail, as Van Pelt says, "a fool who has stepped in the Holy of Holies."</P>
<P>He's an earnest man, if nothing else, who says he drinks forty cups of
coffee and smokes six packs of cigarettes a day. But he is as
recalcitrant today as he was at the trial, failing to admit that he was
wrong, even after it was conclusively shown that he had no clue how to
test for cyanide and his refusal to understand that the concentration
camps had undergone repeated changes since the days of the Holocaust,
which had made his unauthorized tests of chopping up bricks
inconclusive. All he could say as a rejoinder to his accusers, is that
the execution by cyanide is too impractical a method of genocide: "Why
didn't the Nazis just shoot them all?" The answer is simple, the Nazis
lost track of what it was like to be a human being, and they were
determined to use science to carry out their genocide in an impersonal
way. To answer their critics that they were brutes, the Nazis did what
he is doing now, spread the Big Lie that the Holocaust never took place.</P>
<P>This documentary offers one of the most pertinent looks at two highly
charged emotional subjects: capital punishment and the Holocaust, which
makes for a devastating comparison. What's also worth noting, is how
acceptable and rational Leuchter is until the moment the neo-Nazis take
hold of him. That should give one some food for thought about the
American penal system and how it is used to punish offenders. A highly
recommended film.</P>
