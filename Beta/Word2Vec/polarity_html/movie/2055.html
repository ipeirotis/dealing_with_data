<P>     At the tender age of seven, Josh Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc) becomes
fascinated by the game of chess.  Without giving up Little League
baseball, he learns how to play, hanging out with Vinnie (Laurence
Fishburne) and a group of speed chess hustlers who occupy nearby
Washington Square.  It isn't long before Josh is able to beat them
all.  His father, looking to take him to the next level, employs
ex-chess master Bruce Pandolfini (Ben Kingsley) as a teacher.  Under
Pandolfini, Josh matures as a player and, for the first time, he starts
to fear losing.</P>
<P>     SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER is based on the true life story of
Josh Waitzkin who, at the age of sixteen, is currently the
highest-ranked American player under eighteen.  It isn't just Josh's
tale, however.  The name and image of the mysterious chess genius Bobby
Fischer infiltrate this movie.  Fischer is as much an icon to this game
as Babe Ruth is to baseball.</P>
<P>     How important are games to the American way of life?  Have they
become so crucial that we lose sight of the people playing them?  And
at what point does the need to win become so important that the game
ceases to be fun?</P>
<P>     These are some of the questions that SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER
probes.  It certainly can't answer them (since there are no definitive
solutions), but the film offers fodder for thought as it explores
Josh's early career and examines the relationship between the young
chess master and his sports writer father, Frank Waitzkin.</P>
<P>     Josh starts playing chess because it fascinates him.  As soon as
Frank recognizes his son's gift, however, he begins to apply subtle
pressure.  Winning becomes important--perhaps too important--and Josh
is afraid that to fail at the game is to risk losing his father's
love.  It's then that chess becomes a burden and he stops enjoying it.</P>
<P>     Josh has two mentors--the street-smart Vinnie, who teaches him to
play the opponent, not the board; and Bruce Pandolfini, a man who has
suffered an unspecified loss in an unnamed competition, but knows the
game inside out.  Each has a different perspective to offer, and Josh
learns from them both.  One lesson, however, he is unable to take to
heart--he cannot hate his opponents, no matter how much they despise
him.</P>
<P>     We never learn exactly what demons haunt Pandolfini, and it's a
credit to this film that it doesn't make them explicit.  There are
enough clues that they can be guessed at, and SEARCHING FOR BOBBY
FISCHER relies upon the intelligence of its audience to put the pieces
together.</P>
<P>     There are four key relationships in this film, each of which is
explored with varying success.  Even the weakest, that of Josh and his
mother (Joan Allen), has an emotional depth unusual for the amount of
screen time accorded to it.  Of all the adults in the film, only Bonnie
Waitzkin never loses sight of what's best for her son.</P>
<P>     Also treated in a cursory fashion is the unusual friendship that
develops between Josh and Vinnie.  It's clear that the two are fond of
each other, and Vinnie's tactics become important to Josh's development
as a player, but we don't see enough of the two of them together to get
a genuine sense of the mutual respect that grows between them.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the most complex relationship is that of Josh and his
father.  While Frank never stops loving his son, there comes a point
when Josh's winning becomes more important to him than to his son.
This kind of pressure is too much to put on a young boy, no matter how
gifted he is, and it takes a threat by Bonnie to make this clear and
put the situation in perspective.</P>
<P>     Also explored in some detail are Josh's interactions with Bruce
Pandolfini.  Like Frank, Pandolfini loses sight of his young charge's
innocence and age, and tries to mold him into a chess-playing machine.
In some sense, Pandolfini is perhaps attempting to fight the ghosts of
his past through Josh.  It isn't until the end of the film that he is
finally able to accept and love his student for who he is.</P>
<P>     Ben Kingsley and Joe Mantegna do excellent jobs bringing their
characters to life.  These are men with faults, but it's those
imperfections that enable us to empathize with them.  Neither actor has
an overabundance of screen time with which to develop a personality,
but good performers can do quite a bit with an economy of scenes.
Having only a handful of appearances, Laurence Fishburne faces an even
more difficult challenge, but he nevertheless manages to convince us
that he's a true friend to Josh, concerned more about the boy's
happiness than his success.  Joan Allen, despite often being relegated
to the background, gives a convincing portrayal of a mother who cares
so much about her son's well-being that she's willing to take him away
from his father, if necessary, to assure it.</P>
<P>     When casting SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER, the production team
decided that instead of choosing a young "name" actor who might know
little or nothing about chess, they would choose someone who was a
chess player first and an actor second.  Realism was important to the
film makers--they wanted chess-playing viewers to be spared the
indignity of watching someone faking playing the game.</P>
<P>     In Max Pomeranc, an excellent choice was made.  Not only is he an
experienced (as experienced one can be at that young age) chess player,
but he acquits himself admirably in the role of Josh.  He's not the
best child actor to grace the screen, but he avoids the awkward
obviousness of many.</P>
<P>     SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER is an intensely fascinating movie
capable of involving those who are ignorant about chess as well as
those who love it.  The focus of the film is less on the actual game
than it is on the people, emotions, and pressures surrounding Josh.  It
is a tale of human trials and triumph, not a sports movie that panders
to a certain segment of the population.  Chess may not be the most
exciting activity to watch, but SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER makes for
engaging entertainment.</P>
<P>     One final note:  even though this film might seem like a perfect
family movie with its lack of violence, profanity, and sex, I would
caution parents considering taking their children to SEARCHING FOR
BOBBY FISCHER.  With its focus on character development and drama, many
younger viewers will likely become quickly bored.  This is an "adult"
movie ill-suited to those with short attention spans.</P>
