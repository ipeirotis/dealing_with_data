<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Kadosh means sacred in Hebrew. Amos Gitai's fictional work, after
spending most of his career doing documentaries, is a grim story about a
failed Hasidic marriage, even though the marriage is a loving one. The
marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern Israel between
the native Israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political
savvy Hasidic's intolerable one, as both groups are vying for control of
the secular government. Gitai (Devarim/Yom Yom) is a Labor party
leftist, who believes that if the rigid Hasidic ever got control of the
government, it would sound the death knell of Israel.</P>
<P>The emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-Orthodox Jews of that sect
live by the letter of the Torah in everything they do and how they
subjugate the women to accept their vision of God's law from only the
male's view. That if they ever got control of the country, their
intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women
are.</P>
<P>The story takes place in Jerusalem's Jewish quarters called Mea Shearim,
where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the
walls, and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the
protagonists live out their idea of the proper Jewish life, which is
much different than the way most Jews live in Israel. This is a
controversial film, in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes
are to such an extreme patriarchal ones, that the film is bound to anger
most viewers, no matter their belief.</P>
<P>It is a slow-moving, meticulous film, that grabs hold of you by the
collar and never lets go. The force of what is seen, though filmed in an
objective manner, never taking a cheap shot at the Hasidim, is
nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a
practice of strict observance. The film is meant to be critical of such
a rigid people, as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything
they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes, it makes it
impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live
in harmony with their own people, and it would be even more impossible
to imagine them living with their Arab neighbors in peace.</P>
<P>The film opens as Meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual,
where every prayer is made to the virtues of God. He even thanks God
that he didn't make him a woman. His wife Rivka accepts the fate she was
born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately
according to Hasidic custom. She looks at him with glistening eyes, not
questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her
religion keeps her from studying the Talmud and having all the modern
conveniences of life, and from seeing movies and TV. Meir is a Talmudic
scholar. His father (Abu Warda) is a rabbi at the yeshiva. He has been
married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a
child. Since the Hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to
conceive children, and cook and clean house for the man, while the man's
role is to spend his time in prayer, therefore there is an
insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage. She receives
an anonymous letter that states "A woman without a child is no better
than dead." Meir's response, is that it is written like that in the
Talmud. Meir's father tells him that the marriage contract must be
broken: "A man who dies without progeny rips a page from the Torah." All
the blame is placed on Rivka, who is thought of as unpure as the reason
for her being barren. She will go through countless ritual baths to
cleanse herself, as her rigid mother (Koenig) dunks her in the holy
water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an
homage to the 12 tribes of Israel. Their religion doesn't permit them to
be examined extensively by a doctor. Rivka goes on the sly and finds out
that it is her husband who is sterile, but she cannot tell him that
because of their religion. So when Meir's father chooses a younger woman
for his son, she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same
Jewish quarters.</P>
<P>Rivka's spirited younger sister Malka does not want to get married but
wants to live a more liberated life. She has a long time romantic
relationship with a fellow Hasidic Yaakov. But, because of the way they
were both raised, she is still a virgin. When Yaakov joined the Israeli
Army to fight in Lebanon, something his sect is not allowed to do, he is
thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer. He
now works as a singer in a nightclub.</P>
<P>Malka's mother is worried that her daughter won't get married, so she
arranges with the rabbi for her to marry Yossef, someone whom she
doesn't love. Yossef is a very stern follower of the order, he is also a
political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a
bull-horn urging Jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies.
The two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options, with
Rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage, it will make her happy;
but, while Malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it, she has other
plans to ruin this bogus marriage.</P>
<P>The harshest scene in the film is on Malka's wedding night. Yossef prays
to God for a child and then robotically gets Malka to spread her legs,
and without the least bit of affection, only a nervousness shown on his
part for the function he supplies, as he goes inside her and rams her
hard, thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring
without a word or gesture of love.</P>
<P>The sisters have choices, like everyone else in life does. But the
choices are obliterated by one's beliefs, circumstances, and inward
nature, and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes
completely against the way one is brought up. For the sisters, the
choices are life or death ones. Gitai by closing in on the daily
rituals, tight living quarters and close-knit community, has shown how
difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world
and have been kept in the dark all their life. The film ends with the
forlorn Malka walking atop of Jerusalem and looking down upon it as an
outsider would, and everything seems strange to her, all the things she
once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories, as she has
made her choice, and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed.</P>
