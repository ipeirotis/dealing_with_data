<PRE>TENEBRAE (1982)</PRE>
<PRE>A film review by Mike Watson
Copyright 1999 Mike Watson</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: 4 out of 5</PRE>
<P>On re-watching Italian writer/director Dario Argento's much lauded
murder mystery TENEBRAE, I was struck more than anything else by how
many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with.
In emphasising style over matters of plot Argento is somewhat
notorious in cult film circles, but some aficionados still praise
TENEBRAE as the greatest of his "giallo" murder mysteries.  While it's
certainly not perfect, repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a
densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller.</P>
<P>The story follows a promotional visit to Rome by famous American
mystery novelist Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa) where he discovers
that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book
"Tenebrae".  With the police on his back for leads, he decides to take
a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a
mystery where all is not as it seems.  The film benefits enormously
from a fine central performance by Franciosa.  He brings grace, charm
and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an
interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the
unfolding real-life horror around him.  </P>
<P>The film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension.  Argento
peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an
amoral, ambivalent, shadowy world where desire in all its forms has
become a dangerous business.  TENEBRAE is perhaps the most
multi-layered of Argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling
underneath the surface here.  It may take at least two or three
viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play.  In that
respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo DEEP RED/PROFONDO
ROSSO (the full-length Italian language version) and fans will enjoy
spotting the recurring themes.</P>
<P>Needless to say for Argento fans, there is no denying the director's
brilliance as a stylist.  Many of the action and murder sequences are
directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of
intriguing camerawork.  They are all the more impressive for the fact
that in this film Argento creates mood by filling his scenes with
light, rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier
works like DEEP RED and SUSPIRIA.  Instead, TENEBRAE'S set design and
lighting paints a sleek, clinical, chilly vision of a vaguely
futuristic urban world.  And the soundtrack's mix of electronic
atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent Argento collaborators Goblin
is the perfect accompaniment.</P>
<P>So TENEBRAE has much to recommend it, no question.  Still, constantly
nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the
narrative.  Some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in Argento
films, but damnit, it matters in ALL films to the point where viewers
don't deserve to feel cheated.  By the way, if you don't want to know
the solution to the mystery THEN SKIP THE NEXT THREE PARAGRAPHS.</P>
<P>About an hour into TENEBRAE the story takes an unexpected twist which,
properly handled, could have proved ingenious.  We witness the murder
of the serial killer himself by a man who, we later discover, is none
other than the author Peter Neal.  He is insane, apparently.  The
murders then continue for the remainder of the film as Neal decides
it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic
wife.  He is finally revealed to us as this "second killer" in the
film's bloody climax.</P>
<P>But Argento muffs the twist, both technically and narratively.  You
see, we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this
scene Peter Neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in
the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house.
But thanks to poor editing, its had to believe Neal could have
murdered the killer anyway.  Bad cutting puts the timing way out.  In
other words, he's almost in two places at once.  During this crucial
scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring.  By the film's end
you realise that for the sake of an alibi Neal must have
self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look
like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant.  The injury?  He banged
himself on the head with a bloody great rock!</P>
<P>Thus, the revelation of the "hero" as a killer (and anti-hero) in the
final scenes may still prove shocking, but its all somewhat
implausible by the time the end credits have rolled.  Helpfully, in
the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal
humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to Neal
all along.  But there too is a problem, as the explanations offered
for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least.  The
story owes us a better understanding of Franciosa's mind, his
concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage.</P>
<P>TENEBRAE is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies.  For
instance, a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later
we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike.  We would
assume the rider is the same boy, but it turns out to be some male
character we aren't even introduced too!  That's careless filmmaking,
pure and simple.</P>
<P>Why, you may ask, do I go on about the story's flaws?  Because when it
comes to visuals and set pieces, Argento is one of the most exciting
filmmakers in the world.  Take one of the extended scenes in TENEBRAE.
An upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard
dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence
and chases her across town.  Finally, as she desperately seeks escape
from this crazed canine, she accidentally stumbles on the serial
killer's lair.  It's an absolutely masterful sequence, tense and
exciting, and communicating a wealth of information through visuals
alone.  And that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so
frustrating.  Too often, it seems, Argento's films as a whole are less
than the sum of their impressive parts.</P>
<P>Mind you, if you love murder mysteries then TENEBRAE is still worth a
look.  And if you're a fan of Argento's unique style of giallo
thriller then it's essential.  See the uncut widescreen version if you
can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by Luciano
Tovoli.  It's a stylish, great-looking and quirky film despite the
problem narrative.</P>
<P>A shame, because it doesn't have to be that way.  Take Argento's more
recent STENDHAL SYNDROME (1992), where with the aid of co-writer
Franco Ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any
of his surreal weirdness or visual panache.  Proof that he CAN do it,
if he tries...</P>
