<P>     Short of climbing aboard a time capsule and peeling back eight and 
one-half decades, James Cameron's magnificent TITANIC is the closest any 
of us will get to walking the decks of the doomed ocean liner.  
Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, TITANIC is the kind 
of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity.  You don't just 
watch TITANIC, you experience it -- from the launch to the sinking, then 
on a journey two and one-half miles below the surface, into the cold, 
watery grave where Cameron has shot never-before seen documentary 
footage specifically for this movie.</P>
<P>     In each of his previous outings, Cameron has pushed the special 
effects envelope.  In ALIENS, he cloned H.R. Giger's creation dozens of 
times, fashioning an army of nightmarish monsters.  In THE ABYSS, he 
took us deep under the sea to greet a band of benevolent space 
travelers.  In T2, he introduced the morphing terminator (perfecting an 
effects process that was pioneered in THE ABYSS).  And in TRUE LIES, he 
used digital technology to choreograph an in-air battle.  Now, in 
TITANIC, Cameron's flawless re-creation of the legendary ship has 
blurred the line between reality and illusion to such a degree that we 
can't be sure what's real and what isn't.  To make this movie, it's as 
if Cameron built an all-new "Titanic", let it sail, then sunk it.</P>
<P>     Of course, special effects alone don't make for a successful film, 
and TITANIC would have been nothing more than an expensive piece of eye 
candy without a gripping story featuring interesting characters.  In his 
previous outings, Cameron has always placed people above the 
technological marvels that surround them.  Unlike film makers such as 
Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, Cameron has used visual effects to 
serve his plot, not the other way around.  That hasn't changed with 
TITANIC.  The picture's spectacle is the ship's sinking, but its core is 
the affair between a pair of mismatched, star-crossed lovers.  </P>
<P>     TITANIC is a romance, an adventure, and a thriller all rolled into 
one.  It contains moments of exuberance, humor, pathos, and tragedy.  In 
their own way, the characters are all larger-than-life, but they're 
human enough (with all of the attendant frailties) to capture our 
sympathy.  Perhaps the most amazing thing about TITANIC is that, even 
though Cameron carefully recreates the death of the ship in all of its 
terrible grandeur, the event never eclipses the protagonists.  To the 
end, we never cease caring about Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo 
DiCaprio).</P>
<P>     "Titanic" sank during the early morning hours of April 15, 1912 in 
the North Atlantic, killing 1500 of the 2200 on board.  The movie does 
not begin in 1912, however -- instead, it opens in modern times, with a 
salvage expedition intent on recovering some of the ship's long-buried 
treasure.  The expedition is led by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton), a 
fortune hunter who is searching for the mythical "Heart of the Ocean", a 
majestic 56 karat diamond which reputedly went down with the ship.  
After seeing a TV report about the salvage mission, a 101-year old woman 
(Gloria Stuart) contacts Brock with information regarding the jewel.  
She identifies herself as Rose DeWitt Bukater, a survivor of the 
tragedy.  Brock has her flown out to his ship.  Once there, she tells 
him her version of the story of "Titanic"'s ill-fated voyage.</P>
<P>     The bulk of the film -- well over 80% of its running time -- is 
spent in flashbacks.  We pick up the story on the day that "Titanic" 
leaves Southampton, with jubilant crowds cheering as it glides away from 
land.  On board are the movie's three main characters:  Rose, a young 
American debutante trapped in a loveless engagement because her mother 
is facing financial ruin; Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), her rich-but-cold-
hearted fiancé; and Jack Dawson, a penniless artist who won his third-
class ticket in a poker game.  When Jack first sees Rose, it's from 
afar, but circumstances offer him the opportunity to become much closer 
to her.  As the voyage continues, Jack and Rose grow more intimate, and 
she tries to summon up the courage to defy her mother (Frances Fisher) 
and break off her engagement.  But, even with the aid of an outspoken 
rich women named Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), the barrier of class looms 
as a seemingly-insurmountable obstacle.  Then, when circumstances in the 
Rose/Cal/Jack triangle are coming to a head, "Titanic" strikes an 
iceberg and the "unsinkable" ship (that term is a testament to man's 
hubris) begins to go down.</P>
<P>     By keeping the focus firmly on Rose and Jack, Cameron avoids one 
frequent failing of epic disaster movies:  too many characters in too 
many stories.  When a film tries to chronicle the lives and struggles of 
a dozen or more individuals, it reduces them all to cardboard cut-outs.  
In TITANIC, Rose and Jack are at the fore from beginning to end, and the 
supporting characters are just that -- supporting.  The two protagonists 
(as well as Cal) are accorded enough screen time for Cameron to develop 
multifaceted personalities. </P>
<P>     As important as the characters are, however, it's impossible to 
deny the power of the visual effects.  Especially during the final hour, 
as "Titanic" undergoes its death throes, the film functions not only as 
a rousing adventure with harrowing escapes, but as a testimony to the 
power of computers to simulate reality in the modern motion picture.  
The scenes of "Titanic" going under are some of the most awe-inspiring 
in any recent film.  This is the kind of movie that it's necessary to 
see more than once just to appreciate the level of detail.</P>
<P>     One of the most unique aspects of TITANIC is its use of genuine 
documentary images to set the stage for the flashback story.  Not 
satisfied with the reels of currently-existing footage of the sunken 
ship, Cameron took a crew to the site of the wreck to do his own 
filming.  As a result, some of the underwater shots in the framing 
sequences are of the actual liner lying on the ocean floor.  Their 
importance and impact should not be underestimated, since they further 
heighten the production's sense of verisimilitude.  </P>
<P>     For the leading romantic roles of Jack and Rose, Cameron has chosen 
two of today's finest young actors.  Leonardo DiCaprio (ROMEO + JULIET), 
who has rarely done better work, has shed his cocky image.  Instead, 
he's likable and energetic in this part -- two characteristics vital to 
establishing Jack as a hero.  Meanwhile, Kate Winslet, whose impressive 
resume includes SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, HAMLET, and JUDE, dons a flawless 
American accent along with her 1912 garb, and essays an appealing, 
vulnerable Rose.  Billy Zane comes across as the perfect villain -- 
callous, arrogant, yet displaying true affection for his prized fiancé.  
The supporting cast, which includes Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton, Frances 
Fisher, Bernard Hill (as "Titanic"'s captain), and David Warner (as 
Cal's no-nonsense manservant), is flawless.</P>
<P>     While TITANIC is easily the most subdued and dramatic of Cameron's 
films, fans of more frantic pictures like ALIENS and THE ABYSS will not 
be disappointed.  TITANIC has all of the thrills and intensity that 
movie-goers have come to expect from the director.  A dazzling mix of 
style and substance, of the sublime and the spectacular, TITANIC 
represents Cameron's most accomplished work to date.  It's important not 
to let the running time hold you back -- these three-plus hour pass very 
quickly.  Although this telling of the "Titanic" story is far from the 
first, it is the most memorable, and is deserving of Oscar nominations 
not only in the technical categories, but in the more substantive ones 
of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Actress.</P>
