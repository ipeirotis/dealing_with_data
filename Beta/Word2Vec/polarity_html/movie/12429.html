<P>     With new, high-profile animated features being produced by 
Twentieth Century Fox, Warner Brothers, and Dreamworks, movie-goers may 
have reason to be upbeat about the future of big-screen animation.  The 
line of thinking goes something like this: now that the competition has 
upped the ante, Disney will be shaken out of its complacency, and this 
will result in a return to the quality evident in their early '90s 
productions, such as BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  Fox's entry, ANASTASIA, 
proved that Disney-like animation can be achieved by a corporation not 
associated with the Magic Kingdom.  So, it was with great interest that 
observers watched to see what Warner Brothers would do with the baton 
that was passed to them for THE QUEST FOR CAMELOT.  The result is simple 
and disheartening:  they dropped it.</P>
<P>     Back in the late '80s and early '90s, as Disney began to realize 
profits from THE LITTLE MERMAID and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, a number of 
other studios rushed a series of low-budget animated efforts into the 
pipeline in an attempt to siphon off a few dollars from unsuspecting 
viewers who might mistake any motion picture cartoon for a Disney 
effort.  (Remember FERNGULLY?  If you don't, count yourself lucky.)  
Sadly, Warner Brothers' much-hyped THE QUEST FOR CAMELOT seems like one 
of those second-rate features.  It's dull, uninspired, and, worst of 
all, characterized by artwork that could charitably be called 
"unimpressive."  Its no exaggeration to say that the Disney direct-to-
video animated sequels to ALADDIN and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST possess a 
more polished look than THE QUEST FOR CAMELOT.</P>
<P>     The story, which is likely to make Arthurian purists sick to their 
stomachs, focuses on a dark period in the history of Camelot, when King 
Arthur's fabled sword, Excalibur, is lost as the realm comes under 
attack by the evil Sir Ruber (voice of Gary Oldman), whose goal is to 
supplant Arthur (voice of Pierce Brosnan) on the throne.  Meanwhile, off 
in a remote village, a young woman named Kayley (voice of Jessalyn 
Gilsig), the daughter of one of the Round Table's most honored knights, 
the late Sir Lionel (voice of Gabriel Byrne), embarks on a quest for the 
sword when her mother, Lady Juliana (voice of Jane Seymour), is captured 
by Sir Ruber's men.  Along the way, she gathers a diverse group of 
companions, including a blind recluse (and love interest) named Garrett 
(voice of Cary Elwes), a silver-winged falcon, and a two-headed talking 
dragon (voices of Don Rickles and Eric Idle). </P>
<P>     If the surprisingly poor level of the animation was THE QUEST FOR 
CAMELOT's lone failing, the movie might still have been entertaining, 
but the problems only begin there.  Almost every aspect of the 
production has an obvious flaw of some sort, and the overall impression 
is that not a lot of care went into the crafting of this particular 
animated adventure.  To be frank, what THE QUEST FOR CAMELOT offers 
isn't much more impressive than what can be found on TV every Saturday 
morning.</P>
<P>     The film's ripping off of stock Disney elements is blatant.  Kayley 
is presented as a heroine struck from the same mold as Ariel and Belle 
(especially Belle).  Cornwall and Devon, the two-headed dragon, are 
replicas of THE LION KING's comic duo of Pumba and Timon.  And, like in 
ALADDIN, there are numerous quick references to easily-recognized 
Hollywood movies (including, amongst others, TAXI DRIVER and SUPERMAN).  
The story that these elements are grafted onto is not especially 
invigorating -- it's basically a group of characters running around in a 
forest, dodging perils, and looking for a lost sword.  The Disney 
animated screenwriters may not be masters of plot and characterization, 
but their efforts eclipse these.</P>
<P>     The songs are another misstep.  THE QUEST FOR CAMELOT would have 
been considerably improved without the lineup of about a half-dozen 
treacly, completely forgettable tunes by David Foster and Carol Bayer 
Sager.  As far as I can tell, they serve three superfluous purposes:  
(1) to pad the running length, (2) to interrupt any flow generated by 
the sputtering storyline, and (3) to sell soundtracks.  Worse still, the 
"actors" providing the singing voices (Andrea Corr, Bryan White, Celine 
Dion) don't sound anything like the actors providing the speaking 
voices.  </P>
<P>     In all honesty, kids in the under-10 range will probably enjoy THE 
QUEST FOR CAMELOT, and, since it's aimed at them, it's difficult to be 
too harsh on the film.  Keep in mind, however, that most children will 
contentedly watch just about anything that resembles a cartoon.  One of 
the big selling points of the Disney animated features is their appeal 
to viewers of all ages.  In this case, those who are more discriminating 
than the average 9 year-old will discover that THE QUEST FOR CAMELOT 
rapidly grows tiresome.  Consequently, any adult on a search for the 
holy grail of animated pictures is advised to keep looking.</P>
