<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>I think I've seen this film before: it's called Pulp Fiction. But that
aside, this is a very funny crime caper, involving double-crosses,
kidnappings, and outrageous shootouts. It is stylized noir-- meaning
noir is no more to be taken seriously as in the post-WW11 noir films. It
is now used by many directors as a spoof of the genre, as it is here, by
the first-time woman director, Jennifer Leitzes. The film relies on its
characters to make things happen, as the  story really is too slight to
do the complete job, of making Montana bigger than the small state of
mind it is.</P>
<P>Nick Roth (Tucci) is dying of cancer. Claire Kelsky (Sedgwick) is Nick's
hit man partner in the big city syndicate, with the big boss being
Robbie Coltrane, someone Claire has worked for during the last twelve
years and is very loyal to, as she feels she owns him all that she has.</P>
<P>The title of the film is derived from Montana being thought of as a
symbol of what is ideal, an escape from the rotten world of big cities
and crime. It is the state to go to when one is through trying to play
the crime game or thinks about when one is dying and needs to be
comforted.</P>
<P>Claire and Nick bring in an Asian bagman who robbed their boss but who
doesn't have the money on him. In a very funny scene, where they get the
wrong Asian, at first, in the trunk of their car and when they realize
their mistake toss him out on the gutter and get the Asian they wanted,
and then cuff him to the radiator in the boss's headquarters so they can
sweat the information of where the money is out of him. But they are
being set-up by the organization's moneyman, Duncan (Philip Seymour
Hoffman). He gets the boss's ear and poison-tongues the only two in the
syndicate who remain loyal to the boss.</P>
<P>The boss's sexy girlfriend Kitty (Tunney), who wants to leave the boss
but can't, slips the handcuffed bagman a gun. When the boss interrogates
the bagman, he tries to kill the boss before revealing where the money
is. Nick shoots him before he can fire. Meanwhile, Kitty has taken a
powder, and the boss doesn't know who gave the bagman the gun,
concluding that he wasn't searched properly.</P>
<P>As a punishment for screwing up, the boss sends Claire and Nick, to
retrieve the money. He also insists they take along his obnoxious and
mentally deficient son, Jimmy (Embry). Nick tracks the suitcase of money
down by talking with the bagman's wife. Meanwhile Claire and Jimmy
locate Kitty, but when Claire leaves him alone with Kitty, junior wants
to rape her and, as he gets on top of her, Kitty grabs his gun and blows
his head off. Nick and Claire know they are in trouble now, that it will
be hard to explain this to the boss. But Claire says she has faith that
the boss will trust her after all those years together. Nick tells her
not to go alone to the boss.</P>
<P>Another partner of the boss's, a silent one, Dr. Thomas Wexler (Ritter),
who has written a book on the Step Program, one of those self-help
motivational books, that has gotten him quite a following, is doing an
infomercial when Claire and Nick approach him. He is the one who gave
the money to the bagman, and he reveals to them that he has hired Duncan
and most of the men in the boss's organization to double-cross the boss.</P>
<P>Wexler orders his men to kill Claire, and in a funny scene Claire is
seen digging her grave while two of the gangsters watch, as a little boy
curious as to what she is doing questions her. Claire will outwit the
men and kill them. The little boy returns, curiously seeing her now
filling up the hole and wanting to know where the men are. There is also
a spoof shootout scene, with all the boss's men coming after Claire and
Nick in a swank hotel room, their guns blazing away. It was scenes like
this, coming in flashes, that kept the film alive.</P>
<P>Stanley Tucci is a marvelous actor and is a joy to watch here. Kyra
Sedgwick works well with Tucci and significantly adds to the farcical
nature of the film. Philip Seymour Hoffman never gives a bad
performance; here he is the creepy turncoat, a part he can do in his
sleep by now. But he does it well. The high level of acting raises this
ordinary film in stature, but does not make it into anything more than a
highly entertaining and derivative film.</P>
