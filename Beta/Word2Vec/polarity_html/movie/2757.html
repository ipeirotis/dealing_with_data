<PRE>                                     PATTON
                       A film review by James Berardinelli
                        Copyright 1994 James Berardinelli</PRE>
<P>     I don't usually do reviews of older movies, but PATTON happened to
be playing in a local "revival" theater and, although I've seen the
film many times on TV and video, I'd never before viewed it on a large
screen.  As a result, I took this opportunity to see it and
subsequently write a review.</P>
<P>     By the way, for years now, I have considered PATTON to be my
favorite all-time motion picture.  What that says about my character,
you can guess for yourself....</P>

<PRE>     "Through the travail of ages 
     Midst the pomp and toils of war, 
     Have I fought and strove and perished 
     Countless times upon a star. 
     As if through a glass, and darkly, 
     The age-old strife I see, 
     For I fought in many guises, many names, 
     But always me." 
          - Gen. George S. Patton, Jr. </PRE>
<P>     In early 1971, the Academy Awards saluted PATTON.  Capturing eight
Oscars--including best picture, best director, best actor, best
screenplay, best editing, and best production design--the movie won
every major battle of the evening.  Such acclaim was richly deserved,
for PATTON remains to this day one of Hollywood's most compelling
biographical war pictures.</P>
<P>     With its larger-than-life, yet at the same time singularly human,
portrayal of Gen. George S. Patton, Jr., Franklin Schaffner's picture
is an example of filmmaking at its finest.  From production design and
battle choreography to simple one-on-one dramatic acting, PATTON has it
all.  There is no scene in all one-hundred seventy minutes that doesn't
work on some level.</P>
<P>     Patton was not a friendly, easygoing person.  A war hero and a
keen strategist, he was also harsh, stubborn to the point of
intransigence, and undiplomatic.  Aside from the campaigns he waged in
North Africa, Sicily, and across Europe, the general is perhaps best
remembered for an incident when he slapped an enlisted man.  The news
media of the time vilified him for this, and the history books have
been little more kind.  That single act, more than anything, typified
the national perception of him.</P>
<P>     That side of the man is shown in PATTON, but there are more facets
to the general's personality than what he presented in public.  There
was also the deeply thoughtful philosopher, who believed in God and
destiny, and accepted reincarnation (he believed that he had been on
the battlefield when the Carthaginians fought the Romans, and had later
served with Napoleon).  Patton was neither cold nor insensitive--he
cared deeply about those under his command who stood in the face of
enemy fire and refused to yield.  In its evenhanded presentation,
PATTON does justice to those aspects of the general's character, in
addition to the more obvious ones.  What we see is not a legend, but a
man, with all the flaws and triumphs that made him who he was.</P>
<P>     Into the role stepped George C. Scott, giving the performance of a
long and impressive career.  Indeed, Scott became so identified with
the character, and played the general so perfectly, that the Patton of
documentaries has since occasionally been referred to as "an imposter."
In a part that requires a skillful scaling of the emotional ladder,
Scott finds the perfect balance between bombast and subtlety.  From the
opening scene (the famous speech to the Third Army in front of the
giant American Flag), the viewer's attention is riveted to the screen,
and only when the final credits roll do external distractions reassert
themselves.  It is no exaggeration to say that, in the decade of the
seventies, only men like Brando, Pacino, Nicholson and De Niro equalled
what Scott accomplished in PATTON.</P>
<P>     The film opens in 1943 North Africa, with a brutal look at
American casualties at the battle of Kasserine.  Patton arrives from
Morocco to take command the U.S. army in Tunisia in preparation for
fighting Rommel (Karl Michael Vogler) at el Gitar.  From North Africa,
Patton's forces move to Sicily, where they sweep north across the
island, taking Palermo, then racing Montgomery (Michael Bates) to
Messina.  Along the way, Patton's verbal and physical abuse of a
soldier suffering from "battle fatigue"--which the general brands as
cowardice--becomes ammunition for his critics.  He later offers a
public apology, but this incident keeps him from the action for a
while, and he must stand by as a decoy during the Normandy invasion.
Later in the year, however, General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) gives
Patton command of the Allied Third Army, with which he pushes across
Western Europe to stop the Germans at the Battle of the Bulge, the last
major Nazi offensive of the war.</P>
<P>     With the exception of Patton, the only character given more than
cursory attention is Omar Bradley, who is shown to be a conservative,
level-headed antithesis to Patton's impulsive, ill-tempered bluster.
Bradley begins the film serving under Patton, and ends it as his
superior.  The two are friends, but each finds fault with the other's
methods.  As Bradley says, "I do this job because I've been trained to
do it.  You do it because you love it."</P>
<P>     The statement that Patton "is [his] own worst enemy" is proven
repeatedly.  After the slapping incident, while the general is
essentially on probation, he makes some comments that he believes to be
off-the-record.  The press prints them, and Patton is seen as having
insulted the "Russian Allies" by claiming that the United States and
England would jointly rule occupied Europe following the war.  In order
to get back into favor with his superiors, Patton must promise to keep
his "big mouth shut."</P>
<P>     PATTON manages the intricate task of presenting personal details
in the larger context of their historical backdrop.  We observe
detailed recreations of the battles of el Gitar, Sicily, and the Bulge,
even as Patton's own desires, needs, and hopes are exposed through his
actions and conversations.  The most defining moments for the general
as a person often come when he's alone with his aide, or facing his own
mortality as he gazes across battlefields that are millennia old.</P>
<P>     Fred Koenkamp's photography does justice to the picture's
material.  Not only does he have a good sense of how to capture a
battle on film, but he is equally adept at framing the quieter, more
personal moments.  The last shot of the film, with Patton walking his
dog across a snow- spotted field in Bavaria, blends the best of both
these intimate and panoramic views.  Jerry Goldsmith's fine--and
immediately recognizable--score compliments Koenkamp's
cinematography.</P>
<P>     Those who have not seen PATTON, or who have not watched the film
carefully, might assume that this movie is about World War Two and one
of its most celebrated generals.  In fact, they would be only partially
correct.  What PATTON sets out to do is to demythicize its subject and
show the forces that drove this man.</P>
<P>     Brilliant tactician, merciless disciplinarian, tireless fighter,
prima donna, and staunch patriot--Patton was all of these things and
more.  Life for him was the battlefield, and without war, his spirit
was sapped.  The German military recognized this when they noted that
Berlin's fall would finish him.  Patton was an anachronism--a man who
belonged in another time.  He was a warrior living in a time when
victory in battle no longer meant the triumph it once had, a Roman
conqueror who understood the meaning of the words that "all glory is
fleeting."  Above all, however, he was an icon whom millions cheered,
millions hated, and few understood.</P>
