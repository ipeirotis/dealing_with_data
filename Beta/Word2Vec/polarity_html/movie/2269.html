                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Robin Williams, Sally Field, Pierce Brosnan, Harvey
Fierstein.
Screenplay:  Randi Mayem Singer & Leslie Dixon.
Director:  Chris Columbus.</P>
<P>     I've never been a member of the Robin Williams fan club.  A little
bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way, and I sometimes
feel as though I'm watching a 40-year-old class clown.  In his films,
Williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely
emotion, leading to wildly uneven performances.  MRS. DOUBTFIRE seemed
ready-made for the same problems, but instead it proves to be Williams'
best comic screen project yet.  While it still contains some
characteristic self-indulgence, MRS. DOUBTFIRE is nonetheless an
engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy.</P>
<P>     Williams stars as Daniel Hillard, a cartoon voiceover artist with
a penchant for irresponsible behavior.  One such incident proves one
too many for wife Miranda (Sally Field), and she files for a divorce.
Unemployed, living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with
limited time with his three beloved children, Daniel decides to respond
to Miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper.  He turns to his brother
Frank (Harvey Fierstein), a theatrical makeup artist, and emerges as
Euphegenia Doubtfire, a matronly 65-year-old Englishwoman.  Daniel uses
his access to the house to keep an eye on Miranda's flirtation with a
wealthy client (Pierce Brosnan), to spend time with the children, and
to learn something about responsible parenting, all the while trying to
keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best.</P>
<P>     MRS. DOUBTFIRE has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to
work, and basically it does so.  The most crucial is that no one in the
family recognizes Daniel, and thanks to the fantastic special makeup
that's instantly believable.  It may be one of the most convincing
transformations ever committed to film, making Dustin Hoffman's Dorothy
Michaels look like Milton Berle.  More problematic was a series of
calls Daniel makes to Miranda posing as nannies from hell; it's a bit
hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her
husband's.  Perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is
that Daniel could make a quick change into Mrs. Doubtfire in a few
minutes.  There's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex
mask.  Fortunately, these are inconsistencies which only attract
attention as the credits roll.  During the film, I was generally too
busy laughing.  After getting off to a slow start involving too much of
Williams' riffing, MRS. DOUBTFIRE kicks into high gear once the wig and
pads are in place.  Daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is
wonderful, as is the climactic restaurant sequence, even though I saw
the resolutions coming a mile away.</P>
<P>     Clearly, most of the credit for DOUBTFIRE's success goes to Robin
Williams.  It took putting him in drag, but for once he plays a comic
character that isn't just Robin Williams with a different name.  He
thoroughly inhabits Euphegenia Doubtfire, and seems to relish the
scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed.  Wisely,
he never aims for saintly.  His responses to the intrusion of new
suitor Stu are often petty, but the kind of thing most of us might do
with the benefit of anonymity.  It's one of MRS. DOUBTFIRE's charms
that neither Daniel nor Miranda is perfect, just people trying to be
better.  As Miranda, Sally Field is solid in a background role, and
Pierce Brosnan is nicely understated as Stu.  The children are also
good, although Mara Wilson is almost oppressively cute as the
youngest.  The supporting players merely step aside and allow Williams
to do his thing.</P>
<P>     It's easy to see MRS. DOUBTFIRE as little more than TOOTSIE warmed
over, and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific
details in common.  But MRS. DOUBTFIRE manages to carve out its own
space, particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a
judge's decision and the ultimate status of Daniel and Miranda's
relationship.  There's nothing dazzlingly new in MRS. DOUBTFIRE, but
there are plenty of laughs, and good comedies are always in short
supply.  And it's nice to see Robin Williams just act for a change.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 pounds of latex:  7.</PRE>
