<P>     On its way to being the Loch Ness Monster's answer to ET, MAGIC IN THE
WATER has trouble staying afloat.  Director/co-writer Mark Stevenson's heart
is in the right place, but his screenplay stumbles trying to find the right
mix of magic and realism.  The result loses too much of its enchantment
amidst failed attempts at a FISHER KING subplot and an underwater
"adventure" sequence.  Nevertheless, one area where MAGIC IN THE WATER is an
undisputed success is in the casting of its young lead actress.  Newcomer
Sarah Wayne is nothing short of radiant.</P>
<P>     The '90s have featured a number of impressive child actress' debuts.
Anna Paquin garnered an Oscar for her turn in THE PIANO.  Tina Majorino,
late of WATERWORLD, has won raves for several films.  And Kirsten Dunst
opened eyes with her roles in INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE and LITTLE WOMEN.
More luminous than any of these, however, is Sarah Wayne, who singlehandedly
rescues MAGIC IN THE WATER from turning into something unbearably cheesy.
Wayne's portrayal arrests the viewer's attention even when the scene is
silly.  She has a winning smile, a fresh demeanor devoid of artifice, and is
able to successfully convey a wide range of emotions.</P>
<P>     Wayne plays Ashley Black, the pre-teen daughter of talk radio shrink
Jack Black (Mark Harmon).  Ashley's parents are divorced, and she and her
teenage brother, Joshua (Joshua Jackson), live with Mom.  This summer,
however, their workaholic dad has agreed to take them on an extended
vacation to Glenorky, British Columbia, home of the mythical, Loch Ness-like
"Orky."  The problem is, Jack brings along his cellular phones and portable
PC, and once he gets to Glenorky, he shuts out his kids and starts working.
When Ashley finally gets her father's attention by claiming to have seen the
fabled lake monster, Jack is understandably skeptical... until he has a
visitation of his own -- one that changes the way he sees life and relates
to his children.</P>
<P>     The ET element of the story works fine, and even offers a nicely-
framed, politically correct message about the evils of environmental
pollution.  Had MAGIC IN THE WATER concentrated its efforts on this plot
element, it might have been more satisfying, but the film spends an
inordinate amount of time chronicling Jack's transformation from self-
centered work addict to carefree, loving father.  Not only is this part
scripted with a distinct lack of flair, but Mark Harmon's performance comes
across as more childish than child-like.  Add to that a completely
unnecessary climax featuring an underwater rescue, and MAGIC IN THE WATER
ends up with too many bad subplots clinging to its central premise.</P>
<P>     Needless to say, given the PG rating, this is family fare, although the
screenplay has a little more of an edge than some of the summer's tame
entries.  It's certainly not a good film, and I can't give it even a
lukewarm recommendation, but there are isolated moments when the film works
as well for adults as for kids.  Above all, however, there's Sarah Wayne,
MAGIC IN THE WATER's most noteworthy asset.  She may not be enough to lure
many people into the theater, but once they're there, her performance will
be enough to keep most of them in their seats.</P>
