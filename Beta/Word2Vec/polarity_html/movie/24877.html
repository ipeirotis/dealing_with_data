<PRE>SCREWED</PRE>
<PRE>Review by John Beachem</PRE>
<PRE>* * 1/2</PRE>
<P>Directed by: Scott Alexander, Larry Karaszewski
Written by: Scott Alexander, Larry Karaszewski</P>
<P>Willard Fillmore (Norm Macdonald) is chauffeur to an evil old hag,
Virginia Crock (Elaine Stritch). Actually, his job title may be
chauffeur, but his actual duties consist of doing just about
everything from scrubbing Crock's dentures to feeding her dog,
Muffin. After Crock gives him a pie for Christmas, rather than the new
suit he so desperately needs, Willard hatches a plan with his friend,
Rusty (Dave Chappelle), to kidnap Muffin and ransom him back to Miss
Crock. The plan, of course, backfires and a new plan must be
hatched. This one consists of Willard himself being ransomed. Rusty
and Willard decide to fake Willard's death by having a mortician,
Grover Cleaver (Danny DeVito), fix up a corpse to look like
him. Everything manages to go wrong with every plan the trio think up,
and the situation grows worse and worse.</P>
<P>Danny DeVito seems to be developing an interesting and slightly
worrisome habit with his script choices. His last two pictures have
had three things in common. Both involved evil, universally hated old
women; some sort of cheesy, tacked on mystery; and a horrible, poorly
written script. This is a shame considering what a talented actor
DeVito is. "Screwed" is a weak, often painfully forced and unfunny
film which will most likely vanish from theaters in a month. The movie
starts off with no humor except Macdonald ("Dirty Work") doing a
somewhat amusing impersonation of Bruce Campbell's Ash from "Evil Dead
II". This lack of humor lasts for about 45 minutes, and the movie then
begins to show some signs of life, with one or two truly funny
scenes. Unfortunately, this doesn't last, and the film ends horribly.</P>
<P>Let's get one thing straight everyone. Norm Macdonald cannot act in
any way.  The man stumbles through his lines with the same poker face
and dreary, boring voice throughout all his films. His lack of emotion
can be somewhat amusing in stand up comic sketches on Saturday Night
Live, but it doesn't translate well into movies. Dave Chappelle can be
one of two things in his movies: irritating or very irritating. In
Martin Lawrence's "Blue Streak" he was irritating. In "Screwed" he is
very irritating. The man has the most annoying, whiny tone of voice
you're likely to hear. DeVito does what he can with his miserable
role, but you can't pull something out of nothing. I think the
character of Grover Cleaver was supposed to be some sort of mad
scientist who was funny because of all the disgusting things he did -
like play harmonicas pulled out of dead people. However, Cleaver is
disgusting in a very unfunny way.</P>
<P>There are few things worse than a movie which tries far too hard to be
funny. Comic films are at their best when they aren't trying as hard
as possible to be humorous. On the rare occasions that "Screwed"
manages to pull a chuckle out of its audience, it drags the scene on
well past the point where it is welcome. For example, when Muffin
jumps out the back of Rusty's van while he and Willard are driving
(that's funny, right?), the camera stays focused for several minutes
on the two in the front seat, joking about taking the dog. "Screwed"
only runs 90 minutes, but it's a long hour and a half. I'd recommend
it to people who, for some reason, like Norm Macdonald movies, but to
no one else. I'm giving the movie two and a half out of five stars out
of respect for Danny DeVito, and because there are a few funny scenes
at about the mid point that almost give the film some saving
grace. Almost.</P>
