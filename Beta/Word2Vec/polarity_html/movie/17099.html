<PRE>PASSING GLORY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In 1994, director Steve James's mesmerizing documentary HOOP DREAMS was
on the top of my best of the year list as well as on the top of both
Siskel's and Ebert's.  This year, James comes back to the basketball
courts with a film, the nicely named PASSING GLORY, based on a real
story of a black basketball team.  Set in the not yet integrated South of
1965 (when I graduated from high school in Texas), the movie tells the
poignant story of a championship black basketball team with a singular
vision, to play the winner of the city's white league.</P>
<P>Set in heavily Catholic New Orleans, the teams in the film are all from
Catholic high schools.  Rip Torn plays Father Grant, the
sometimes-rebellious headmaster of a black high school.  Father Grant
tried before to integrate the league but was shot down by the
Archbishop.  His teams regularly win the championship of the "Negro"
league but can never play any white teams.</P>
<P>Unlike many other films examining that era's racial strife, GHOSTS OF
MISSISSIPPI for example, PASSING GLORY keeps the focus on the blacks and
their struggle, rather giving most of the screen time to white racists.
The prejudice of most of the whites in the area is compellingly
presented, but they are not allowed to dominate the picture.  Frequently
the hero in these films is some white anti-segregation activist, usually
from the North.  This time, the protagonist does come from the North,
but he is a black priest named Father Verrett.  ("Why would a brother
want to become a father?" one of the perplexed black basketball players
asks rhetorically.)</P>
<P>Steve James, who was at our screening when PASSING GLORY closed San
Jose's Cinequest Film Festival, said that when he read the script, he
immediately saw André Braugher as the perfect choice to play Father
Verrett.  He was amazed and gratified to find that the studio, Turner
Pictures, was already planning on casting him in the role.  Braugher so
naturally fits the part of the real-life Father Verrett, that he gives
the picture an almost documentary realism.  He brings strength, idealism
and humanity to the part.  A man who, for a time, becomes persona non
grata to white and black parents alike for his willingness to shake up
the system, Father Verrett is the epitome of a role model, and Braugher
acts like he was born to play the part.</P>
<P>Hired as a history teacher, Father Verrett will not let the athletes in
his classes be given the special treatment that they've been used to.
"I teach history," he informs the headmaster when asked to take over the
suddenly vacant position of basketball coach.  "I believe sports are
overemphasized."  Moreover, coming from the North, he can't understand
why star black athletes don't go to the best white colleges, as they
should.  "Down here, 'should' and 'is' is a long ways apart," the dad
(Bill Nunn) of the team's star informs him.</P>
<P>The film includes many tangible examples of the racism then present.
The blacks have to go to a separate "coloreds only" line at fast food
outlets, and ordering a meal in the wrong place can and does get you
thrown in jail.  (I can remember the "coloreds only" signs from my
childhood, although, where I grew up, they were taken away a half decade
earlier than in this movie.)  The simple but powerful script by Harold
Sylvester -- James said that John Sayles helped with one of the rewrites
-- is filled with lines of honest beauty.  "Son, if you sit in the back
of the bus too long, you'll think you belong there," Father Verrett
lectures one of his reluctant players.</P>
<P>Although most of the action in the movie happens off the courts, the
basketball sequences are masterfully and excitingly presented.  In the
inevitable big game that ends the movie, there is an extremely
controversial edit.  I asked the editor, Paul Seydor (TIN CUP), about
the edit, and he immediately knew the cut I meant.  With a big grin, he
said that when he read the script he thought this works great in print
but cinematically it'll never work.  An editor with tremendous pride in
his craft, he confessed that this was one time he was glad to be proved
wrong.  The director thought the cut was essential to his vision, and
Paul said the director was right.  The director's whole movie is
"right."  I can't wait for Steve James's next picture.</P>
<P>PASSING GLORY runs a fast 1:30.  It is not rated but would perhaps be
PG-13 for some profanity and mature themes and would be excellent for
kids around 12 and up.</P>
