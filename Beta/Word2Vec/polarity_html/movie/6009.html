<PRE>                             ROMEO AND JULIET
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>     In honor of my wife and my twenty-seventh wedding anniversary this
past September the thirteenth, I am going to do something I've never
done before.  I am going to review a film I have not seen in ten years.
Since the true mark of a great movie is its ability to forever cast an
indelible mark on our memory, reviewing a picture you haven't seen in a
decade actually makes some sense.</P>
<P>     Late in the year of 1968, Franco Zeffirelli released a new version
of the most well known love story in the English language, William
Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET.  The film had a long run and was still
playing the summer of 1969 when my wife Sally and I got married.  To
this day, it is the only film I have seen more than four or five times.
Like Trekies, we want to see the film constantly doing our courtship
and could quote most of the lines.  Although I have long since lost
count, I know the number of times we have seen the picture is between
fifteen and twenty.  We frequently would stay to see it twice in a row
at the local mutliplex.  A more romantic and realistic rendition of the
nature of love, I have never seen.</P>
<P>     Although the play "Romeo and Juliet" has been made into movies
many times before and would be made again, no one has ever captured
young love as Zeffirelli did.  First, the casting of two photogenic,
talented, but unknown actors of the right age was the foundation upon
which he created a masterpiece.  With Olivia Hussey as Juliet and
Leonard Whiting as Romeo he had the basic ingredients, but just having
the right cast does not a masterpiece make.  It only makes it possible.</P>
<P>     To this casting, he rounded it out with other equally talented but
unknown actors including, Roberto Bisacco as Count Paris, Paul Hardwick
as Lord Capulet, Pat Heywood as the Nurse, John McEnery as Mercutio,
Milo O'Shea as Friar Laurence, Natasha Parry as Lady Capulet, Antonio
Pierfederici as Lord Montague, Bruce Robinson as Benvolio, Esmeralda
Ruspoli as Lady Montague, Keith Skinner as Balthazar, Robert Stephens
as the Prince of Verona and Michael York as Tybalt.  The only major
actor was Laurence Olivier who was the narrator.</P>
<P>     All of the supporting cast were excellent, but Pat Heywood, John
McEnery, Milo O'Shea, Michael York were especially brilliant.
McEnery's Mercutio was a complex and bizarre reading that fit the
spirit of the character perfectly.  York's Tybalt was excellent as a
character not seeking a fight, but more than confident of his ability
if forced by circumstances.</P>
<P>     It is interesting to note that only a few of these actors,
including the stars, had much success after this film.  Hussey and
Whiting basically faded into oblivion.</P>
<P>     When Romeo feels the rush of love swell up in his veins during a
party, the audience vicariously experiences that same rapture.  When he
presses Juliet's hand at the dance, it is more erotic than many a scene
today where the actors are all buck naked.  Finally, the balcony scene,
which every student knows and probably thinks is trite, is made fresh
in Zeffirelli's capable hands.</P>
<P>     The morning after Romeo and Juliet's love making, there is the
briefest of scene where they are both naked.  I liked the way
Zeffirelli handled this.  He included it to show the reality of the
situation, but editor Reginald Mills trimmed it down to just flash the
scene on the screen before moving on.</P>
<P>     Although it is clear from the beginning that this is a love affair
that is destined for tragedy, when the tragedy does strike, the
audience is crushed anyway.  By the middle of the picture, it is
impossible not to be in love with the two protagonists and thereby not
want any harm to come to them.</P>
<P>     The ending is sad, but effective.  This is the richest and most
moving of any Shakespeare play I have ever seen made for the screen,
and as a critic, I have seen a lot of them.</P>
<P>     I can not leave this tribute to one of my absolute favorite
pictures without mentioning a few of the outstanding technical aspects
of the film.  The lush and hazy cinematography by Pasqualino De Santis
deservedly won the Academy Award that year.  From the very first image,
the audience is alerted that something special is about to unfold.</P>
<P>     The script by Franco Brusati, Maestro D'Amico, and Franco
Zeffirelli is true to the play.  Brief sections of the play were
removed to get the play down to the right length and pacing for a
movie, but Shakespeare's poetic language was not tampered with.</P>
<P>     The editing was flawless.  The action sequences are full of
energy, but never too choppy.  The love scenes stay with the character
perfectly.</P>
<P>     The Academy Award winning costumes by Danilo Donati are gorgeous.
Especially well done are the clothes worn at the dance and all of
Juliet's clothes.  They are naturally lovely without being showy.</P>
<P>     Finally, the music by Nino Rota is so memorable it leaves you with
music and songs forever in your subconscious.  I love the theme song
and still hear it being played today.</P>
<P>     There is another remake coming of "Romeo and Juliet" this year.
This time it will be set in modern day Florida and start Claire Danes
(LITTLE WOMEN) and Leonardo DiCaprio (WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE).
Although I am sure I'll see it, it will probably feel like a sacrilege
to this fan of Zeffirelli's version.  As always as a critic, I'll try
to keep an open mind.</P>
<P>     ROMEO AND JULIET runs a fast 2:18.  It is not rated, but would
probably get a PG today for the extremely brief nude scene and for the
tragic theme.  There is no sex or bad language.  There is a little
violence of sword fighting and poisoning.  The picture would be fine
for any kid old enough to be interested which is probably eight and up.
I give this picture my strongest recommendation and my highest rating
of ****.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
