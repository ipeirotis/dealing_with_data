<P>     In the wake of the phenomenal success of James Cameron's TITANIC, 
it is only natural that all things about the world's most infamous 
shipwreck should suddenly become items of great interest.  That includes 
the best-known pre-1997 Titanic film, A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, and the book 
of the same title upon which it was based.  Those who take the time to 
sit through the earlier movie's account of the story will find that it 
is at once both like and unlike the epic romantic tragedy brought so 
successfully to the screen forty years later.</P>
<P>     The temptation is, of course, to compare the two films, but that 
would be as profoundly unfair as trying to analyze the similarities and 
differences between GONE WITH THE WIND and GETTYSBURG just because both 
transpired with the same historical event as a backdrop.  TITANIC is a 
grand melodrama, with a pair of fictional characters caught up in a 
maelstrom of romance, lust, danger, heroism, and pulse-pounding 
adventure.  The special effects are among the best ever brought to the 
screen, turning the final hour into nothing short of a cinematic tour de 
force.  A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, on the other hand, is a more reserved 
motion picture.  It uses historical characters to tell the real story, 
relying on the first-hand accounts of survivors for nearly every 
sequence and line of dialogue.  The romance is gone, but there's still 
plenty of adventure and heroism, and a subplot excised from TITANIC that 
deepens both the tragedy and the suspense.  Finally, although the 
visuals are not nearly as impressive, they're good enough to allow us to 
suspend disbelief and become thoroughly immersed in the story.  </P>
<P>     A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is presented with such austerity and 
unflinching impartiality that it occasionally fools us into thinking 
that it's a documentary, not a work of fiction.  In fact, director Roy 
Baker and producer William MacQuitty were so committed to telling the 
genuine story of the disaster that they would probably both consider 
that statement to be a compliment.  For their source material, they 
chose the most comprehensive and exhaustively researched book of the 
time, Walter Lord's  A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.  Few aspects of the historical 
record were compromised during the novel-to-screenplay conversion.  A 
few individuals were bundled into "composite characters," certain events 
were modified to heighten their dramatic impact, and the sinking ignored 
the fact that the ship broke in two during its final moments.  Other 
than that, the story told by A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is pretty much how 
things happened (at least as far as we know).</P>
<P>     A NIGHT TO REMEMBER opens with the launch of Titanic on her maiden 
voyage in April 1912.  On hand for the proud occasion are both the 
ship's designer, Thomas Andrews (Michael Goodliffe), and the head of the 
White Star Line, J. Bruce Ismay (Frank Lawton).  Since no footage exists 
of Titanic's actual launch, the film makers spliced together archival 
material depicting other, similar ships, including the Queen Elizabeth 
and the Lusitania.  To all but the expert eye, this will not be 
noticeable.  After Titanic has pulled away from land, most full shots of 
the ship are of a large model.  </P>
<P>     The story is told through the eyes of second officer Herbert 
Lightroller (Kenneth More), one of the heroes who survived the sinking.  
Before the unsinkable ship's unfortunate encounter with the iceberg, 
Lightroller is presented as an affable, competent officer.  Afterwards, 
as the harsh reality of the situation descends, he is shown to be the 
rarest of men:  one who not only copes at the eye of a hurricane of 
chaos, but thrives in it, urging calm and saving lives to the very last.</P>
<P>     During the course of the film's 123-minute running length, we meet 
a number of interesting figures, many of whom did not live to tell about 
the fateful ocean crossing.  There's the boisterous, unsinkable Molly 
Brown (Tucker McGuire); the wealthy Benjamin Guggenheim, who drowned in 
his best dinner clothes; the stalwart Col. Archibald Gracie, who died 
eight months after the sinking; Sir and Lady Duff Gordon, two of only 
twelve people in a lifeboat that should have seated 40; the loving Mr. 
And Mrs. Lucas (John Merivale and Honor "Pussy Galore" Blackman); and 
Joughin the baker (George Rose), who survived by getting drunk.  Among 
the crew, we are introduced to Captain Chris Smith (Laurence Naismith), 
the world's highest-paid sea officer only weeks away from retirement; 
Phillips (Kenneth Griffith) and Bride (THE MAN FROM UNCLE's David 
McCallum), Titanic's beleaguered wireless operators; first officer 
Murdoch; quartermasters Rowe and Hinchins; and Captains Stanley Lord of 
the Californian and Arthur Rostron of the Carpathian.  With so many 
characters, it's no surprise that there's little time to identify with 
any of them; A NIGHT TO REMEMBER tells of an event without becoming 
particularly wrapped up in the lives of anyone affected by it.</P>
<P>     A NIGHT TO REMEMBER's attention to detail is well-known.  The film 
makers used still shots of the original ship when re-creating the decks, 
the first dining saloon, the forward stair case, and the smoking room.  
The technical advisor was none other than fourth officer Joseph Groves 
Boxhall.  The actors hired to play the various historical figures were 
chosen not only on the basis of their ability to convincingly portray 
the parts, but because of their physical resemblance to the men and 
women they were standing in for, whether dead or alive.  And all outdoor 
scenes were filmed in cold weather so that the actors' breath could be 
seen.</P>
<P>     One of the great strengths of A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is how it manages 
to balance the many stories aboard Titanic with the tales of its should-
have-been rescuer, the Californian (a ship a mere 10 miles away that, as 
the result of fate and negligence, never realized what was happening), 
and its actual rescuer, the Carpathian (which arrived on the scene only 
a couple of hours after Titanic went down, and was able to save the 
survivors and transport them to America).  These are aspects of the 
entire event overlooked by Cameron, and their presence deepens the sense 
of irony and desperation.  </P>
<P>     If there's a weakness to A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, it's that the special 
effects are limited by the technology of the era.  They're not bad per 
se, but, after seeing Cameron's TITANIC, it's only natural to expect 
something a little more impressive than an overlit model floundering in 
a large pool of water.  There's no doubt that this approach works within 
the context of the movie, but it's virtually impossible to watch the 
scenes of the ship sinking without recalling the grandeur of how it went 
down in 1997.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the best way for TITANIC fans to view A NIGHT TO REMEMBER 
is as a companion piece -- more factual than any other feature produced 
about the event and more absorbing than any of the lengthy, dry 
documentaries about the subject.  Of course, A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is good 
enough to stand on its own (many critics will argue that it's a better 
film than Cameron's epic), but it works differently when seen side-by-
side with its gargantuanly-budgeted sister.  The truth is that the tale 
of the Titanic is big enough to be seen from many different vantage 
points, and 1997's TITANIC and 1958's A NIGHT TO REMEMBER offer two of 
the most compelling perspectives.</P>
