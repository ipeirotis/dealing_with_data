<P>     Luis Stevens (Mark Dacascos) returns from a four-year stint as a
Green Beret in Brazil to find that his old high school in Miami has
turned into a breeding zone for violence and drugs.  Determined to do
all in his power to turn Lincoln High--and its students--around, Luis
proposes a program to the principal (Todd Susman) and key members of
the faculty (including Geoffrey Lewis and Stacey Travis):  give him the
twelve worst students in the school and, through a specialized kick
boxing program that will harness their naturally destructive energies,
he'll make them into decent human beings, and create a blueprint by
which the entire school--and perhaps the city itself--can be changed
for the better.  Of course, the leader of the local gangs, a vicious
man called Silverio (Paco Christian Prieto) isn't pleased about this at
all.</P>
<P>     Going into this film, I expected it to be an obligatory
late-summer, mindless, plotless action films.  I was wrong.  It's a
late-summer, mindless, plotless action film with a message.  I think I
prefer this sorts of film when it doesn't try to preach.  Somehow,
sermonizing and beating peoples' brains in don't make an appealing
combination.</P>
<P>     Don't look for even a whiff of originality in this film.  It takes
plot elements from one movie and mixes them with those from about fifty
others.  Needless to say, this leads to a lot of confusion, and at
least three plot threads which come to abrupt and inexplicable
dead-ends.  Not that you're likely to care, but what ever happened to
the nasty teacher who was romantically involved with Luis' girlfriend
Dianna (Stacey Travis)?  Or how about the bad guys threatening her to
keep Luis in line?</P>
<P>     There are also a number of transitional scenes that aren't there
(although where they got left out, I don't know--they could be on the
cutting room floor).  For example, one moment Dianna is explaining to
Luis that they're no longer kids and, while she admires what he's
trying to do, it's over between them since she has a new boyfriend.
Nevertheless, shortly thereafter, the two are getting awfully
intimate.  Talk about a jarring turn of events....</P>
<P>     Then there are the twelve baddest kids in school who, predictably,
get turned into model citizens through the amazing powers of their
masterful teacher.  Somebody should bring this miracle worker to the
President's attention.  What's even more astounding is that Luis never
gets stabbed or shot.  There are some token guns and knives in
evidence, but nothing close to what you'd expect at the High School
from Hell.  Guns, you see, would have gotten in the way of the message,
not to mention the unfair advantage they would have given the bad
guys.</P>
<P>     Speaking of which, the script does everything it possibly can to
make Silverio the meanest hombre you've ever laid eyes on.  He's nasty,
sadistic, and beats up our hero without breaking much of a sweat.  He
deals drugs and runs a chop shop.  We never see him kill anyone, but
it's a given that murder is on his resume.  Heck, for all we know, he
eats orphans for breakfast.  Even I, cynical viewer that I am, felt an
occasional stirring of raw animal hatred for this Satan incarnate.</P>
<P>     Actually, Paco Christian Prieto does a more than passable job as
the bad guy--if you're looking for someone who overacts the part to
the hilt.  I kept expecting him to let out a loud roar and start
pounding his well-muscled chest (which he, like the hero, shows off at
every possible opportunity).  Mark Dacascos is also passable,
especially when he doesn't have to talk.  Geoffrey Lewis, who has
played a lot of bit parts in movies and TV shows, does an absolutely
embarrassing job as the good-hearted teacher Kerrigan.</P>
<P>     Most of the kick boxing sequences are entertaining to watch (at
least compared to the rest of the movie), although sometimes the action
goes so fast that it's difficult to figure out who's who.  In the
climactic "match," the problem is largely resolved by having one
character a couple of feet taller than the other, but even that doesn't
eliminate all the confusion.</P>
<P>     For those who thought the ending of SCENT OF A WOMAN was pure
"cornball," you ain't seen nothin' yet.  Take a look at the final scene
of ONLY THE STRONG and you'll note that it's got Pacino's film beaten
by a long stretch.  Of course, there's a massive leap of illogic needed
to get to the finale here, but that fact generally gets lost in the
massive overdose of artificial sweetener that the audience is subjected
to.</P>
<P>     There is one good thing that I can say about ONLY THE STRONG.  It
isn't boring--or at least not too boring.  The message it tries to get
across--that kids can take control of their own lives and devote
themselves to causes other than gangs--is laudable, but the medium
chosen for presenting it is awful.  If you want somebody to listen,
you'd better put together something worth listening too, not a movie
stopping oh-so-briefly in the theaters on the way to the video store.</P>
