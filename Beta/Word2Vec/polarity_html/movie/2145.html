<PRE>                               HARD TO DIE
                      A film review by Ken Johnson
                       Copyright 1993 Ken Johnson</PRE>

                   situations, violence)

<P>     Five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a
strange box gets delivered there (is this starting to sound familiar?)
by mistake.  The girls accidentlly open the box (big surprise, huh!)
and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by
one (betcha didn't see that one coming!).</P>
<P>     HARD TO DIE, I found out while watching the film, is a sequel to
SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE 2: NIGHTIE NIGHTMARE (r.a.m.r.# 1521).  Two of
the actresses from SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE 2 are in this film, Robyn
Harris and Melissa Moore, but they play different characters here.
Orville Ketchum is also back as (get ready for this) Orville Ketchum
(yes, the same character from number two).  Yes, he is also built like
a tank in this film too.  I'm telling you, a nuclear bomb detonated
next to this man wouldn't harm him at all!  The before mentioned three
were the only actors from part two that I thought could act, well they
seemed to have lost that ability.  Thankfully, for my sanity, I also
saw the film WARLOCK, which undid all the ill effects that I got from
this film.</P>
<P>     The story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many
elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks.  Any good moments
that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story
line.  The film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has
already been figured out, analyzed, and discarded before it happens.
There is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot.  While
we are on the subject of the story, the story also provides every
chance it can to disrobe an actress.  The film goes to the extent of
putting a shower in the manager's office.  I'm sorry folks but this is
completely unnecessary, ridiculous, and hurts the story more (if that
is still possible).</P>
<P>     The script for this film is completely pathetic.  The lines the
actresses come out with are completely horrible.  The only thing that I
think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they
went along.  Here is an example of the wonderful dialog.  The scene is
two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a *really*
big gun.  The line is "My dad used to be a Marine, I bet I can work
it."  This line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of
infamy.  Now, we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big
plan (?!!?) has been presented.  One comment from an actress is "Not a
lot of strategy involved, but I like it."  I'm afraid folks that this
is about as good as they get.</P>
<P>     Now lets talk about the great special effects for this film.  This
obviously wasn't a big concern of the film makers.  The killing scenes
are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the
viewer's intelligence.  A girl gets hacked with a knife and enough
blood comes out to do one FRIDAY THE 13TH movie.  Are we trying to see
how unrealistic we can get?  The continuity department was obviously
asleep (along with the viewers) when watching this film.  In one shot,
actress has cloths on, camera angle changes, actress seems to have lost
clothing.  Very impressive trick!</P>
<P>     The one (half?) plus that this film has going for it, is that in
many places it is unintentionally hilarious.  The incompetence behind
the film makes it incredibly funny, and so the viewer can get some
enjoyment (?!!?) from the film.  However, this doesn't make it worth
the rental fee of over a penny.  In the acting department, the only
thing I can say is two thumbs squared and one head down.  I would
normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic, but there is no point
here because there is nobody that I was impressed with in the least.
Oh well, win some, lose some.</P>
