<PRE>Show Me the `Money'
by Homer Yen
(c) 2000</PRE>
<P>The keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber, the naive
ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse, and a partnership
that blossoms between the two are the fine components
that make up a modest, little caper adventure entitled
`Where the Money Is.'</P>
<P>The elderly bank robber is Henry (Paul Newman), a
famous criminal that was only recently caught.  He has
pulled off dozens of successful heists and has
probably stashed away a small fortune.  Always the
shrewd thinker, he begins working on a plan to get out
of jail.  This involves years of studying Buddhism and
self-hypnosis.  When he is prepared to execute his
plan, he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke. 
Now a seemingly twitching vegetable, he is temporarily
transferred to a state-run home.</P>
<P>Carol (Linda Fiorentino) is the nurse that cares for
him.  She's a very bright person with a good heart. 
Yet, her life is a miserable waste of time.  The most
exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars.  Her days
at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair
calisthenics.  Worse, she's in a dead-end relationship
with high-school sweetheart Wayne (Dylan McDermott). 
They became a couple because they were king and queen
of the prom.  To her, this made sense long ago.  But
now, it's a different story.  </P>
<P>Wayne seems equally bored with his life, but is
content enough to stay put.  Wayne's greatest ambition
is to become a night shift supervising foreman.  Carol
feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital
patients, but she's never been anywhere else and
doesn't see many other opportunities in life. 
However, when Henry falls under her care, her outlook
begins to change.</P>
<P>The medical reports may state that he suffered a
massive stroke.  Carol, however, begins to grow
suspicious that Henry may just be faking it after all.
 Maybe she can get through to him, and maybe she can
learn something about the money that he has stashed
away.  The opening 30 minutes are filled with
hilarious attempts of Carol trying to bring Henry
‘back to life.'  And what are some of Carol's
resuscitation techniques?  Perhaps an erotic lapdance
might stir his senses.  If that fails, maybe she'll
try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a
20-foot high pier into the cold lake below.</P>
<P>When he finally comes out of his state of self-trance,
the movie's direction changes, though it remains
equally if not more entertaining.  Carol sees that
Henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness. 
She is invigorated by his commanding presence and
refreshed by his vibrancy.  This, of course, puts
Wayne in an odd situation.  Henry and Carol's bond
grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to
rob an armored car.  Henry needs this heist because he
is unable to retrieve his original stash.  Meanwhile,
this is Carol's ticket to a better life.  Wayne is
uncomfortable with the situation, but helps out
nonetheless.  However, his lack of commitment
threatens their success.  The heist sequence is
suspenseful, well paced, and casts the uneasy feeling
that something will horribly go wrong.  </P>
<P>`Where the Money Is' does more to spotlight Newman and
Fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a
nifty heist.  Newman is the real joy of the film,
adroitly showing that at age 75, he's still really hot
stuff.  He possesses a sly smile, displays a
dominating attitude, and a projects a demeanor that is
undeniably attractive.   Fiorentino is also a fun
presence.  You root for her despite her sense of
amorality.  Sure, she wants to commit robbery and has
little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken
man into a lake, but we can see that to escape her
dead-end world, she needs to do something drastic. 
With two charismatic characters such as these, it's
hard to ignore that `Where the Money Is' is where the
fun is.</P>
