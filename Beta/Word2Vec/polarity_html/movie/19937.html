<PRE>The Haunting (1999)
Review by Brian Matherly
*1/2 out of *****</PRE>
<P>Cast: Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson, Lili Taylor, Bruce 
Dern, Virginia Madsen, Lisa Loeb
Written by: David Self
Directed by: Jan de Bont
Running Time: 112 minutes
Date Reviewed: August 4, 1999</P>
<P>Overblown remake of the 1963 Robert Wise film of the same name (based on 
Shirley Jackson's novel "The Haunting of Hill House") stars Lili Taylor as 
one of three "lab rats" that participate in a supposed "insomnia" study 
being initiated by Liam Neeson.  He is actually conducting a study on the 
causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it.  He drags the 
test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of "creepy" CGI 
effects scare the cast and try the audience's patience.</P>
<P>I know this question has been posed before, but why do people keep remaking 
good movies?  The original was a great psychological horror film.  This new 
version is dull and very decidedly not scary.  In fact, I feel it is 
downright impossible to make a modern day PG-13 horror movie that is scary.  
Unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening, then 
there's nothing in this
film that will raise hackles.  I nearly fell asleep twice during the film, 
and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn't seem to have 
such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to 
discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed.</P>
<P>It's sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly.  Owen Wilson spends 
most of the film wandering the halls of the house, and the script does no 
justice to his wonderful comic ability.  Catherine Zeta-Jones (always nice 
to look at) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac 
that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise 
occurs.  Liam Neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape 
recorder and
attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what's 
going on as the rest of them do.  Finally, poor Lili Taylor, the center of 
the film, gets the brunt of the CGI effects thrown at her while everyone 
else gets to scream and try to rescue her.  Apparently, a subplot involving 
a tryst between Zeta-Jones and Taylor's characters was filmed but removed.  
That's too bad, because it might have lent some better characterization to 
the narrative.</P>
<P>This is Jan de Bont's second straight misfire (Speed 2:Cruise Control being 
the first).  When is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily 
better?  Robert Wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of 
The Blair Witch Project also knew that.  One should not approach a haunted 
house movie with a Twister mindset.
If de Bont and screenwriter David Self had let our minds fill in the blanks 
as to what was happening instead of showing us everything, it would have 
served to make the film terrifying.  What our mind fashions on it's own can 
be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led 
towards everything.  Apparently, yet another version of this story is being 
filmed under it's original title.  I certainly hope that this newer 
rendition will not be
hurt by the insanity of Jan de Bont's version and that it will retain the 
psychological impact that the original release had.  [PG-13]</P>
