<P>     When I stepped into the theater to see CLEAN SLATE, I had yet to see  
any evidence that Dana Carvey might actually be capable of acting.  In  
fact, he seemed incapable of anything but the broadest schtick.  His  
"Saturday Night Live" characters were usually caricatures, and the  
WAYNE'S WORLD films and the horrible OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS simply  
regurgitated those characters.  So it qualifies as one of the most  
unexpected surprises of the year that CLEAN SLATE turns out to be an  
absolutely delightful comedy.  As improbable as the concept might seem,  
director Mick Jackson (THE BODYGUARD) reins in Carvey's tendency towards  
excess and gives him a real character to work with, and the chance to  
generate big laughs. </P>
<P>     Carvey plays M. L. Pogue, a small-time private eye with a big-time  
problem.  As the result of an explosion, Pogue suffers from a unique form  
of amnesia which causes him to wake up every morning with no memory of  
anything which has taken place before he fell asleep.  That proves a  
hindrance professionally, as he is supposed to testify against  
criminally-connected businessman Cornell (Michael Gambon), but can't  
remember his testimony.  It's also problematic personally, as he seems to  
be involved with at least two women, one of whom (Valeria Golino) is  
supposed to be dead.  With every passing day, Pogue's mystery continues-- 
and deepens--until he finds that he can't trust anyone. </P>
<P>     CLEAN SLATE is so full of unpredictable pleasures that it's  
difficult to know where to begin.  The greatest is probably the  
performance of Carvey, in a role analagous in many ways to Bill Murray's  
in GROUNDHOG DAY.  Like Phil Connor, Pogue is trapped in a cycle of  
repetition and confusion, except that Pogue is the only one who *doesn't*  
know what's going on; like Murray, Carvey gets a chance to play some low- 
key scenes that prove he doesn't always have to be a class clown.  He  
gets to play several hysterical scenes based on Pogue's need to improvise  
every encounter with his friends (including James Earl Jones as a  
wheelchair-bound district attorney, Kevin Pollak as Pogue's jealous best  
friend, and Michael Murphy as his doctor), including a surprise birthday  
party and his eventual testimony against Cornell.  However, Carver is  
equally affecting in moments such as his reaction to discovering that he  
might be a father, and trying desperately to remember a woman he thinks  
he loves.  The nature of Pogue's condition inevitably limits his  
character development, but merely watching Carvey react to that situation  
is endlessly entertaining. </P>
<P>     But there is virtually nothing about CLEAN SLATE which isn't quirky,  
off-handed and charming.  Screenwriter Robert King has filled this film  
with bits that come out of left field, like the sequence where Pogue and  
his mysterious client attempt to escape Cornell's henchmen with well- 
aimed rocks, or a couple of unexplained moments when Pogue demonstrates  
martial arts skills, or Pogue's dog, who suffers from a lack of depth  
perception.  Director Jackson complements the weirdness with visual  
throwaways like the neck brace James Earl Jones' character wears with a  
hole for his tie to come through, and the Band-Aid Carvey sports through  
out the film.  CLEAN SLATE is that rare comedy which simply never goes  
exactly where you expect it to go. </P>
<P>     All this would be quite enough to recommend CLEAN SLATE, but it also  
provides a neatly-polotted little mystery.  Occasionally it feels as  
though King and Jackson are trying to throw in a bit too much (the  
character of Pogue's ex-wife is particularly unnecessary), which  
sidetracks the film's energy.  However, at the end of CLEAN SLATE I was  
left without a single plausibility problem. </P>
<P>     In the 24 hours since I saw CLEAN SLATE, bits and pieces have popped  
into my head constantly, prompting spontaneous laughter, and it just  
keeps growing on me.  It wouldn't be surprising, given Carvey's track  
record and an advertising campaign which can't do it justice, to see  
CLEAN SLATE make a quick exit from theaters.  Then again, there might  
just be one more surprise coming. </P>
