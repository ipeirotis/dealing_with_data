<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A glossy MGM extravaganza of a bible film, more pleasing to watch for
its conspicuous opulence than for its dramatics, dialogue, or politics.
Directed with a mixture of tedium and oomph by Mervyn LeRoy, as this
Roman spectacle set in 64 A.D., at the time of Nero's rule, runs for
close to three hours before Nero decides to do the honorable thing and
stick a knife in himself to say he's done.</P>
<P>Commanding General (Marcus Vinicius) of the 14th legion returns to Rome
after three years of victorious battle in Britannia. He returns to a
corrupt Rome under its nefarious Emperor, the 29-year-old Nero, who
killed his mother and his wife, and loves to think of himself as an
artistic soul, living a debauched life with harems and flatterers
surrounding him, as he plays a bad lyre and sings choppy verses to
praise himself as a greater god than Jupiter. His empress is the lustful
and cunning Poppaea (Laffan), who is having an affair with his head of
the Praetorian Guard, Tigellinus (Truman), right under his curly blonde
locks of hair.</P>
<P>The plot concerns the romance between a beautiful early Christian woman,
Lygia (Deborah Kerr) and the initially agnostic Roman commander Marcus.
They meet when the war-weary, woman-starved soldier is a guest in her
adopted father's house, the former Roman general, who has now secretly
become a Christian. She is physically attracted to the handsome and
athletic man, but is unappreciative of his fighting skills and soldier's
attitude.</P>
<P>Marcus' uncle Petronius (Genn) is one of Nero's counselors who knows how
to flatter him best and gain for himself the emperor's favors. He owns
many slaves and one of the slaves is a beautiful girl who loves him
unabashedly, Eunice (Berti). Marcus is told by his cynical uncle that he
can get the emperor to grant him what he wants for the conquests he
brought to Rome and suggests he takes a rulership in Egypt, but his
nephew instead wants the emperor to turn Lygia over to his care. Anyone
who would choose Deborah Kerr over Egypt deserves to be cheered as a
true Christian convert!</P>
<P>Lygia is dismayed to be with the soldier who tries to take her by force,
as she would rather be in her father's gentle house and take part in the
secret Christian rituals in the catacombs outside the walls of Rome.
Even Peter comes here to explain his apostle days with Christ and how he
fulfilled Christ's prophecy by denying him three times after the
crucifixion, but has come to Rome to build the Christian church as
prophesized by Christ. She also has interesting houseguests, like the
radical rabbi, Paul of Tarsus, who is on a mission across the Roman
Empire to spread the word of Christ and helps her keep the faith by
discussing the gospel.</P>
<P>The stability of the Roman chaos is broken when Nero has this mad idea
of burning down Rome and building it over in his image. He burns it down
and is pleased with the flames he sees and plays the lyre while Rome
burns. But when things go badly and the Roman mobs are ready to attack
him for destroying their homes and so many lives, Poppaea comes up with
this bright idea of blaming the Christians for it. She does this
primarily because she is scorned by Marcus and jealous of Lygia.</P>
<P>Marcus chooses love over the empire and saves Lygia, her giant bodyguard
Ursus (Baer), and her family from the fire, by getting the Roman
soldiers to open up the gates to the city and let the people in. But
when the mob hears Nero's accusations of the Christians causing the
fire, the mob turns against the Christians, and, Marcus is rounded up
with all the other Christians and jailed. Petronius says of Nero's lie,
that people will believe any lie, if it is fantastic enough.</P>
<P>Now Marcus and Lygia must find a way to stop the lions from killing them
in the Colosseum.</P>
<P>Quo Vadis? was a big money grosser for the studio in the pre-CinemaScope
era. They shot the film in Italy, with a cast of thousands. At the time,
it was only second to GWTW in how much cabbage it brought in. It had a
lot of spectacular shots and was well-paced, but it was not a
particularly moving experience. One of the shots I preferred, was of
Nero looking through a a piece of green glass at an orgy while Poppaea
looked at it through a red glass. They had such different perspectives,
you see. Peter Ustinov's delightful over-the-top sissy performance was
fun to watch. There was also a giant killing a bull in the arena, Peter
crucified upside-down, and a beautiful fire to view. They don't make
them like this one anymore because it costs too much and the studios are
not sure if the crowds will come again.</P>
