<P>GODS AND MONSTERS (director:Bill Condon; cast: (James Whale) Ian
McKellen, (Clayton Boone) Brendan Fraser, (Whale's housekeeper, Hanna) Lynn
Redgrave, (Boone's girlfriend, Betty) Lolita Davidovich, (David Lewis)
David Dukes, (Mr. Kay) Jack Plotinick, (Elsa Lanchester) Rosalind Ayres,
(Boris Karloff) Jack Betts, 1998)</P>
<P>James Whale (Ian) is the son of working class parents in north England,
who escaped his early poverty to become a successful director, noted for
his famous monster films. James Whale  directed the original
FRANKENSTEIN (31), THE BRIDE OF  FRANKENSTEIN (35), THE OLD DARK HOUSE
(32), and THE INVISIBLE MAN (33)--- which was his personal favorite.
Whale, always the aesthete and snob, comments to an interviewer that he
just directed the first two Frankensteins, the others were done by
hacks. He also did some non-horror films, most notable is the classy
musical SHOWBOAT (36), and his most inauspicious one is, THE ROAD BACK
(37).</P>
<P>He died of mysterious circumstances in his Hollywood pool in 1957, this
film clears up that mystery (at least, hypothetically) and probes into
his homosexual life, as Jimmy, as he liked to be called, is seen in his
last few weeks alive, living infirmed with the ill effects of a stroke
that makes him either forgetful when medicated or when unmedicated
seeing a lot of images at once, as if it were thunderstorms in the sky,
in the form of violent hallucinations from the past.</P>
<P>What highlights this film and makes it propelled on a high octane level,
is the bravura physical performance of Ian McKellen, whose presence on
screen is gigantic as a swish personality, much like a few other great
performances accomplished recently about gifted artistic and
intellectual English queers, such as Derek Jacobi as Francis Bacon in
LOVE IS THE DEVIL and John Hurt's performance of a fictionalized stuffy
professor in LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND.</P>
<P>To gain access to what this fictionalized but mostly real-life film is
about, one has to look at Jimmy as a homosexual, whose every movement is
influenced by the lust he craves for men and how cunning he is in trying
to entice them, as we see him at his playful best in the splendor of his
tasteful home, being taken care of by the heavily foreign accented
housekeeper (Redgrave), who wears her cross over her apron in earnest,
fearing Jimmy's sins of the flesh will take him to hell, yet finding in
herself the strength to disapprove of his behavior but still be his most
trustworthy caretaker for the last 15 years. She is wonderfully dour in
her supporting role.</P>
<P>If it is fear or disgust of homosexuals that repels you, this film will
displease you, even though its overt physical sex is minimalized, yet
every nuance of the film and all its projections are about what a queer
is like. For openers, we have a pesty and patronizing film college
student (Plotinick) who comes over to interview him, not interested in
his homosexuality but in those horror films he made famous. Jimmy
handles him with bemusement, life is but a strip poker game, he
gleefully says, and since the student's questions are leaving Jimmy
feeling cold, he suggests that they make things interesting, at least
for Whale, by having the student strip off a piece of clothes for any
question asked and in response, Whale promises to answer any question
honestly. This scene turns out to be a classically hilarious comedy
routine, probably capturing Whale's devilish personality as well or
better than the more dramatic scenes did.</P>
<P>The serious focus of the film will become the strange relationship that
will develop between the new gardener for the Whale house, Clayton Boone
(Brendan), who looks like Adonis, and has caught the director's roving
eye, focusing in on his muscular arms and his tattoo from his marine
days, of "Death Over Dishonor," as he charms and beguiles him, knowing
full-well that this stud is all heterosexual. Yet he feels very
comfortable talking to the brutish Clayton and loves the chase of
someone he is attracted to, who seems like a very nice and naive young
man, but will come across later on as a young man with a lot of pent-up
feelings and in need of a fatherly figure to talk to. Clayton is
anything but literary, never even having heard of Whale before, just as
Whale is hardly your prototypical fatherly figure. But Whale opens up
with Clayton and becomes nostalgic about his life and his films, more so
than with the film student who really knew his films, but was just
perceived by Whale as a user of people. It seems that there was probably
some deeply repressed psychological need in Whale to be accepted by
certain types of people, which is why he devotes so much time to the
uninspiring Clayton, it was as if he needed to have his approval to be
gay.</P>
<P>And Clayton gets to like the old man, despite what he can't stand about
him sexually, glad that he met someone who is famous or at least was at
one time.</P>
<P>What is most impressive and understated about the film, is the comic
tone and lightness of Whale, much like the tone Whale used in his horror
films, which he used to hide the real fear of death people have and
their antagonism for monsters, whom Whale simply adored and would never
make fun of. He comes across as debonair at all times, even when in the
middle of a mild stroke, and terribly witty in the ways of Hollywood's
gays.</P>
<P>The only animated sexual delight that we see from him, comes by way of
his ex-lover, the Hollywood producer, David Lewis (David), who after a
particularly dry conversation welcoming Whale back home after his
stroke, kisses Whale intimately on the lips as he departs the house.</P>
<P>During his somewhat voluntarily retirement from Hollywood, not induced
by any scandal, Whale reminds his interviewer, but from his antagonism
with the studio for ruining his career by blaming him for the failure of
THE ROAD BACK, which the studio interfered with unmercifully, ruining
any chance of success that film may have had. He thusly retreated to his
amateur passion for drawing, which he uses to lure Clayton into his
studio, getting him to pose for a drawing of just his head.</P>
<P>There is Whale as the charmer, which is what this film personifies best,
as we see him telling Hollywood stories and talking of his WW1
experiences, which are enhanced by the hallucinations he is having of
those events, and as we see him nested at home with his florid flower
garden and the olympic-sized pool in the background, which the director
never uses for himself, but welcomes men to swim there in their natural
comfort.</P>
<P>Reactions to Whale, as to whether you care for him or not, come about
from how the participants in his life view his films, which we see them
watch on TV. Clayton must somehow see something in them that affects him
greatly, since he alone of the housekeeper and his ex-girlfriend, see's
something endearing in those films, yet he is turned off by Whale's
homosexuality, but he still poses for him, and that only seems to be
because he wants something more than the money he is being paid to pose,
he wants something from him that he is not quite sure that he can
articulate. What both these men need is to get things off their chest,
to talk to someone who can listen to them with some empathy, as they
both suffer from an interminable loneliness and an emotional poverty of
childhood: one with too many stories to tell, living a life of an upper
class gentleman, pretending to be something he was not born into, but
not caring about these pretenses anymore with Clayton, who is far
removed from the circle of people he moves in, so he easily lets his
hair down; and the other, with not enough stories he wants to tell, can
only be a listener and be reluctantly drawn into talking about himself.
Perhaps, both are drawn to each other because they don't travel in the
same circles and can relax with each other since no false
representations of themselves are really needed.</P>
<P>Real Hollywood figures are portrayed in the way Whale probably saw them,
with his so-called monsters (Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester) there is
a frank and polite distance, their friendliness seems genuine enough, as
there is a keen recognition that their fame and illustriousness is
linked together, while for the closet homosexual director, George Cukor,
there is no love lost, as Whale expresses his displeasure at him at
being a pushy upstart, while flashing back to the nude boy parties the
hypercritical Cukor was secretly known for giving, and then we see how
distant they seemed at meeting again in Cukor's mansion, at a rather
dull party to honor Princess Margaret (which never happened in
real-life), where Whale takes Cukor's cold reaction to him without any
visible anger but shows a great deal of resentment at Cukor for getting
to direct a lot of the better films that he wanted for himself.</P>
<P>For all its wonderful performances and charm and probative look into the
gay Hollywood world, this is not a very important film, in the sense
that it has little to say about the creative experience but a lot to say
about how a queer man can manuever his way around the Hollywood of the
past, as long as he didn't make a big show out of his sexual
predilections. Condon has very ably directed a likable and witty film on
a very low budget, that makes its subject seem much greater than it is,
it is as if Jimmy Whale invited us over for some iced tea and cucumber
sandwiches and he told us a few things about himself and the filming of
his Frankenstein movie before he got tired-and-all, so all we had left
to ponder was the materialism and memories he was surrounded by, and how
tired and painful life has become for him, as he wishes for a mercy
killing at the hands of Clayton, but since he couldn't bring that about,
he instead jumps into his pool of seduction and drowns himself.</P>
<P>And what we learned from this biop, is that Jimmy Whale was a gentleman,
a lecherious and cunning one, but still, a gentleman of the old school,
and for most of us, we got to know him better than we ever did before,
via this splendidly done and excellently researched film.</P>
<P>It is apparent that Whale has this tremendous identification with
outcasts (monsters), therefore it seems logical to deduce, that for
those who liked this film, it really came down to what they saw in it
how well they responded to it, just as when Clayton saw the
FRANKENSTEIN  movie on TV for the first time with Betty, and gravitated
toward the film, while Betty saw it as passe, something that wasn't cool
enough for her to enjoy.</P>
