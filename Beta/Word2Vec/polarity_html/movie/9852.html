<P>     It has been several years since I've read a book by John Grisham (I 
believe the last one was THE CLIENT).  After three or four of Grisham's 
novels, I grew tired of the predictable repetitiveness and contrived 
suspense of the narratives.  As a result, the intelligence and subtlety 
of THE RAINMAKER took me by surprise.  I don't know if this is because 
the novel is better than any of the prolific lawyer-turned-author's 
previous efforts, or if Francis Ford Coppola has performed a near-
miracle in transforming the written pages into a screenplay.  Whatever 
the case, THE RAINMAKER stands above any other filmed Grisham 
adaptation, including A TIME TO KILL, the former holder of that title.</P>
<P>     In order to make an appealing movie with a lawyer as the 
protagonist, it's necessary to come up with a villain who can make even 
an attorney look good.  In this case, Grisham has found one -- a big-
time, sleazy insurance company.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that the 
main character in THE RAINMAKER has his heart in the right place.  Sure, 
Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) may be an ambulance-chaser, but that's only an 
unfortunate fact of life.  He's one of the few who doesn't allow the 
realities of practicing law to corrupt his sense of ethics.</P>
<P>     Rudy went to law school because he believed all the myths about 
helping people.  But, because his family had no high-placed connections, 
graduation found him waiting tables to pay off his student loans, rather 
than going to work for a prestigious firm.  Eventually, Rudy hooks up 
with the Memphis-based ambulance-chasing outfit of Bruiser Stone (Mickey 
Roarke), where he's partnered with Deck Shiffler (Danny DeVito), a 
"para-lawyer" who knows the ropes but has failed the bar exam six times.  
Rudy is sent to the local hospital to search for new clients.  What he 
finds instead is a young woman, Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), who has been 
severely beaten by her husband.  The attraction between Rudy and Kelly 
is immediate and obvious, but she's afraid to file for divorce for fear 
that her husband will kill her.  Pretty soon, Rudy and Deck feel the 
heat as a Federal probe closes in on Bruiser, so, together with only 
about $10,000 between them, they open up their own office.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, Rudy is working on his first big case:  suing an 
insurance company for failing to make good on a claim owed to his 
client, a leukemia patient, Donnie Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth).  When 
the inevitable happens and Donnie Ray dies, it becomes a wrongful death 
suit, with Rudy representing Donnie Ray's mother, Dot (Mary Kay Place), 
against a host of high-priced suits led by Leo F. Drummond (Jon Voight).  
But the judge, Tyrone Kipler (Danny Glover), is a fair man, and allows 
Rudy some latitude in presenting his case.  As Rudy puts it, "I'm alone, 
I'm… outgunned… but I'm right."</P>
<P>     THE RAINMAKER keeps the in-trial showmanship to a minimum.  While 
it's virtually impossible to film a courtroom drama where there aren't 
at least a few tricks and unexpected legal maneuvers, THE RAINMAKER does 
a good job of downplaying these so that they're never too difficult to 
swallow.  (Besides, what fun would it be if there were no surprises 
whatsoever?)  The ending is also low-key, with no embarrassing SCENT OF 
A WOMAN display.  At no time does the courtroom erupt into spontaneous 
applause, nor does judge Danny Glover ever have to threaten to clear the 
room. As an added bonus, Rudy and Deck are actually shown acting nervous 
and inexperienced in court.  They make numerous gaffes, occasionally 
stumble over their words (or their feet), and generally appear like 
first-timers, which they are.</P>
<P>     In a recent interview with THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER's Steven Rea, 
Coppola stated that he was tired of being labeled a "gun for hire," a 
term used to refer to him when describing his involvement in the studio 
projects JACK and THE RAINMAKER.  Coppola noted that he wrote and 
directed THE RAINMAKER because he was engrossed by the book and saw 
parallels between Rudy's struggles as a young lawyer and his own early 
years as a film maker.  Coppola also emphasized that he loved making the 
movie, and didn't see it as just a source of quick cash.</P>
<P>     For the most part, THE RAINMAKER is really a character study of 
Rudy.  Everything in the film – his relationship with Kelly, his 
courtroom struggles, and his growing involvement with his clients – is 
designed to highlight his development as an individual.  In the lead 
role, Matt Damon does a fine job portraying the uncertainty of someone 
who believes he has the moral high ground, but realizes that his lack of 
experience could lose the case.  Danny DeVito is perfect as the more 
cynical, financially-driven Deck, providing occasional moments of comedy 
to break THE RAINMAKER's tension.  Claire Danes is heartbreaking as 
Kelly, the young wife who has lost all of her dreams in a sea of pain 
and bruises.  The supporting cast is solid, with turns from an 
uncredited Danny Glover, Virginia Madsen as a witness for the plaintiff, 
Teresa Wright as Rudy's landlady, and Roy Scheider as the CEO of the 
insurance company.</P>
<P>     THE RAINMAKER is not without missteps – for example, the latter 
stages of Rudy and Kelly's relationship seem rushed, as does the ending.  
Overall, however, this is a well-made, absorbing motion picture that 
seems a lot shorter than its 140-minute running length.  Unlike many of 
the other films based on a Grisham book, this one is interested in 
telling a story rather than ambushing the audience with cheap 
contrivances.  It's an intelligent and thoughtful approach, and the 
focus on character and legitimate drama makes this a surprisingly-strong 
late-November release.</P>
