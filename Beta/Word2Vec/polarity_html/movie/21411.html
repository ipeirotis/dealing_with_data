<P>     Before the screening of MUSIC OF THE HEART I attended, there was a
short clip in which Mery Streep and Gloria Estefan appealed to viewers to
support arts and music education. It was a heartfelt appeal, and I was
surprised to find the film evoking a heartfelt response. I was touched by
the perseverance of Roberta Guaspari (Streep), the real-life East Harlem
music instructor on whose life the film was based. I responded
passionately to the narrow-minded administrative mandates that, in times
of budgetary constraint, describe the arts and music in public schools as
"extra," or not part of a "core curriculum." And my heart was lightened at
the sights and sounds of children making beautiful music. I'll willingly
make the following admission, Gentle Readers: I found myself getting
misty-eyed during MUSIC OF THE HEART. </P>
<P>     I follow this admission with one of a different sort, the sort that
makes viewers everywhere want to throttle critics within an inch of their
thumb-turning, star-distributing lives: MUSIC OF THE HEART, moving though
it may be, just isn't a particularly good film. It begins with former Navy
wife and mother of two Guaspari coping -- badly -- with her husband
leaving her, trying to figure out what will come next in her life. In need
of work and a sense of purpose, the one-time musician and occasional
teacher proposes to East Harlem elementary school principal Janet Williams
(Angela Bassett) a violin program for students. Though the program
initially faces major obstacles from parents and other teachers, it
eventually becomes a phenomenal success, providing discipline and a sense
of accomplishment for kids unfamiliar with those concepts. Then those
nasty budget cuts begin rearing their ugly head, forcing Roberta to find
creative funding solutions.</P>
<P>     There's no denying the fundamental emotional appeal of a story like
this one. Hollywood has always loved "inspirational teacher" films, and 
there have been plenty of them: THE MIRACLE WORKER; TO SIR, WITH LOVE;
CONRACK; DEAD POETS SOCIETY; STAND AND DELIVER; LEAN ON ME; MR. HOLLAND'S
OPUS; DANGEROUS MINDS; etc. In recent years they have become even more
prevalent -- perhaps indicative of how much more complicated teaching has
become -- as well as more rigidly formulaic. The unconventional teacher
meets with resistance from students; some intransigent teachers (here the
amusingly monotonal Josh Pais) view the newcomer as a threat to their
slothful cynicism; eventually there is proof that the teacher has made a
difference. </P>
<P>     The ultimate disappointment of MUSIC OF THE HEART has little to do
with its predictability; on the contrary, like many films of its kind it
hits its emotional high notes even though you know exactly where they're
going to come. No, the disappointment in MUSIC OF THE HEART comes from a
strangely fragmented narrative that never quite commits to a central
story. The film occasionally explores the juxtaposition of Guaspari's
background and that of her students, but the intrusions of social problems
in the kids' lives are lurching and token pieces of "reality" -- a child
of separated parents here, a victim of a drive-by shooting there, an
instance of domestic abuse thrown in for good measure. Pamela Gray's
script also toys with Guaspari's own search for confidence as she instills
it in her students, but that story is resolved long before the final
fade-out, leaving a blurry character for Streep to develop. When the story
starts winding its way into Guaspari's experiment with blind dating, you
have to wonder if director Wes Craven has any sense for its focus.</P>
<P>     The real kicker comes during the final 45 minutes, when the story
suddenly leaps forward 10 years to the violin program's financial
crisis. There's no question it was a pivotal moment in the history of
Guaspari's program, nor is there any question the Carnegie Hall benefit 
concert -- featuring big name performers like Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman
and Arnold Steinhardt -- makes for a rousing finish. It just doesn't feel
like part of the same film. STAND AND DELIVER reached its natural 
conclusion with the first successful AP exam; MUSIC OF THE HEART tags on a
45-minute coda after Guaspari's first successful concert. Of course there
are several touching moments in that final 45 minutes, and throughout the
film. Unfortunately, however, it's the ideas alone that are touching, not
the way the film presents them. It's easy to be moved by the sentiments 
expressed in Streep and Estefan's introductory clip.  It's harder to be
moved by a story that lets the mere concept of an "inspirational teacher"
film do all the work.</P>
