<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The film opens in Rome, Italy, and a stressed out couple, both
attractive, fashionable and slender, Marta (Francesca d'Aloja) and
Francesco (Alessandro Gassman), are seen running a successful interior
decorating business. He learns that his aunt, someone that he hardly
knew because she lived for many years apart from his mother, has just
died and left him her house in Turkey. He journeys to Istanbul to sell
the property, and learns from his Turkish lawyer Zozo that the property
has a hamam (Turkish steam bath) attached to it.</P>
<P>In the exotic confines of Istanbul, passions that have been closed to
the young man in Italy, open up as he feels the warm breeze and quickly
settles into the slower pace of life, and relishes in the kindness of
the Osman family who ran the hamam for his aunt. The aunt married a
Turkish man who died and she soon afterwards used the money she acquired
to become the first western woman in Turkey to operate a hamam, which by
tradition is an exclusively male place.</P>
<P>Aunt Anita fell in love with the Turkish way of life, and fixed up the
run-down hamam she bought in the center of town, that under her care
became respected as one of the best in the city. Occupying her house is:
the kindly patriarch Mr. Osman (Ergun), his sensitive wife Perran
(Sezer), their college-aged, very attractive and sweet daughter Fasun
(Basak), and her sensual brother Memo (Gunsur).</P>
<P>Hoping for a quick sale and an early return back to his thriving
business, he runs into problems, as he believes he can't trust his
lawyer, whom he thinks is delaying the sale because he is trying to
knock down the price. Then the woman who wants to buy the hamam from him
tells him she is buying up all the property in the neighborhood to build
a trade center, and he impulsively decides not to sell. And, even
though, he is told that the hamam is now out of fashion and the one he
has inherited needs lots of repairs, he decides to remain and restore it
to its traditional beauty. He is also told that the woman he refused to
sell to is very dangerous.</P>
<P>The family helps in the hamam renovations and they also get him
acquainted with the delicacies of Turkisk food, which they serve him in
generous portions. Meanwhile, Francesco tours the ancient city streets
to absorb the city's rich culture and reads his aunt's old letters she
sent to her sister that were returned unread, describing her
appreciative love for such a filthy city like Istanbul. In one letter
she tells his mother "One can be happy in this life, Giuliana; one
must."</P>
<P>This has a deep emotional affect on Francesco, as he realizes that he
was not happy in Italy, there was something missing in his life. Here he
found an inner peace and a replacement family for his recently deceased
parents. He also can't get over the way Fusun looks at him in an
admiring and loving way, while Memo initiates him into the pleasures of
the hamam, where he also finds comfort in his arms.</P>
<P>Unable to communicate with her gentle husband, Marta arrives in Istanbul
to tell him about her new plans for a divorce -- and of the affair she's
been having with their business associate Paolo for the last 2 years.</P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph.</P>
<P>After Francesco agrees to give her what she wants, the warning Zozo gave
him comes true, as he gets knifed to death in the street. But the film
ends in a surprising way, as something bizarre happens to Marta and she
has a change of heart and becomes the replacement hamam owner for his
aunt, also falling in love with the city.</P>
<P>It was a strange emotional love affair that this film offers its
protagonists -- a love affair with a city rather than with another. The
film presents a lesson on the old and new cultures of both Italy and
Turkey. The director Ferzan Ozpetek is of Turkish birth and spent two
decades living in Italy, and these are his realistic observations of
both cultures. But for a film about passion, this one was very reserved,
showing no nudity or sensual scenes, in fact very little passion.</P>
