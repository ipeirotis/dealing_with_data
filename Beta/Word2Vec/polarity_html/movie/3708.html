<P>     For Krzysztof Kieslowski's North American followers, DECALOGUE has 
attained an almost-mythical status.  Kept out of theaters because of a 
distribution faux pas (the North American distributor refuses to allow 
the films to be shown), DECALOGUE has rarely been screened theatrically 
on this side of the Atlantic.  Fortunately, using a U.K. print, a North 
American "tour" of the production has been organized with stops in 
various cities in the United States and Canada, allowing audiences an 
opportunity to view one of the most important works of the director's 
career.</P>
<P>     There is some truth in the statement that to really understand 
Kieslowski, it's necessary to see DECALOGUE.  For him, this was a 
transition film.  Before DECALOGUE, the director was better known for 
his documentaries; only a few features -- CAMERA BUFF, BLIND CHANCE, and 
NO END -- had generated international attention.  After DECALOGUE, 
Kieslowski released THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE, BLUE, WHITE, and RED -
- all of which are regarded as exceptional pictures.  Bridging these two 
"phases" of film making is the multi-part DECALOGUE, which, taken as a 
whole, may be the most meaningful of all that Kieslowski has brought to 
the screen.</P>
<P>     In the director's own words, he "concentrated more on what's going 
on inside [the characters] than what's happening on the outside."  While 
his earlier pictures dealt with how "external circumstances and events 
influence people", beginning with DECALOGUE, Kieslowski focused on what 
occurs with "people who come home, lock the door on the inside and 
remain alone with themselves."  VERONIQUE and the THREE COLORS trilogy 
illustrate this trend more explicitly, but it first takes root here.</P>
<P>     DECALOGUE was initially produced as a series of ten 1-hour films 
for Polish television.  Two of the episodes, parts 5 and 6, were 
expanded to full-length features released internationally under the 
titles of A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING and A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE.  Each 
segment of DECALOGUE ostensibly concentrates on one of the Ten 
Commandments.  They are, in order, "I am the Lord thy God.  Thou shalt 
have no other God but me" (Part 1), "Thou shalt not take the name of the 
Lord thy God in vain" (Part 2), "Honor the Sabbath Day" (Part 3), "Honor 
thy father and thy mother" (Part 4), "Thou shalt not kill" (Part 5), 
"Thou shalt not commit adultery" (Part 6), "Thou shalt not steal" (Part 
7), "Thou shalt not bear false witness" (Part 8), "Thou shalt not covet 
thy neighbor's wife" (Part 9), and "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's 
goods" (Part 10).  In Kieslowski's opinion, "The relationship between 
the films and the individual Commandments [is] a tentative one.  The 
films should be influenced by the individual Commandments to the same 
degree that the Commandments influence our daily lives."</P>
<P>     Kieslowski first envisioned DECALOGUE as a project to give young 
Polish directors their first shots at film making.  He and his writing 
partner, Krzysztof Piesiewicz (who also co-authored NO END, VERONIQUE, 
and THREE COLORS) scripted the episodes, intending for a different 
director to helm each one.  However, when the screenplays were complete, 
Kieslowski realized they were too good to hand over to someone else.  In 
the end, he directed all ten -- completing the entire series in under a 
year.</P>
<P>     Anyone can make a movie about the Ten Commandments, but few such 
productions would share the subtlety and depth which characterize 
Kieslowski's vision.  It isn't the subject matter per se that gives 
DECALOGUE its greatness -- it's the manner in which the director handles 
his material.  For part 5, those expecting to see a morality play about 
the evils of killing are in for a surprise.  To be sure, this episode is 
about murder and its ramifications, but the issues examined are far more 
complex, and Kieslowski shuns absolutes of good and evil.  </P>
<P>     Many of the segments deal only peripherally with their associated 
Commandment, while others tackle more than one.  Part 2, for example, in 
which a doctor's diagnosis will determine whether an unborn baby is 
brought to term or aborted, is intended to show one of the ways man 
assumes the role of God, and can be seen as a reference to either 
Commandment 1 or 2.  Parts 6 and 9 both deal with themes of love, sexual 
obsession, and jealousy.  Parts 7 and 10 involve thefts, albeit of 
radically different kinds.  Parts 1, 4, and 7 grapple with issues of 
parenting.  Part 3 has virtually nothing to do with the Sabbath, but a 
great deal to do with lying, while the lie of part 8 is only a jumping-
off point for a far deeper ethical debate.  And so it goes for all ten 
episodes, with multiple issues criss-crossing and weaving their way 
through the stories.  </P>
<P>     Like BLUE, WHITE, and RED, each episode of the DECALOGUE cycle can 
be viewed individually.  However, for those who sit through more than 
one, there are several connecting threads.  The entire series takes 
place in one Polish housing complex and, as a result, various characters 
from certain episodes make brief appearances in others.  There is one 
nameless man who has a cameo in nearly every segment (often carrying 
some bulky object).  Occasionally, references are made to the plights of 
others -- for example, the doctor's dilemma in part 2 is debated in an 
ethics class in part 8.</P>
<P>     Each episode of DECALOGUE has a different tone.  Part 1 starts out 
playful as we're introduced to a loving father and son.  Part 2 is 
somber.  Part 3, which takes place at Christmas, is suitably festive, 
and Kieslowski works in a few humorous moments.  The focus in part 4 is 
kept intimate, while in part 5, which deals with capital punishment, 
it's very public.  Part 6 is a warped romance, elements of which are 
later echoed in both WHITE and RED.  Part 7 is another grim episode, 
followed by an even more sobering part 8, about a Holocaust survivor 
confronting the woman who wouldn't hide her.  Part 9 is a modern tragedy 
that ruminates about the real nature of love (it's "in one's heart, not 
between one's legs"), and part 10 is the closest DECALOGUE ever comes to 
being a comedy.</P>
<P>     Each viewer will have an opinion of which segment is the most 
affecting.  At the screenings I attended, it seemed that every person 
had a different favorite.  By way of illustrating the scope of the 
series, I'll spend a little space discussing the three I was most 
impressed with.  Though the content of the other seven differed from 
these, many of the intentions were similar.</P>
<P>     Part One:  "I am the Lord thy God.  Thou shalt have no other God 
but me."  Kieslowski has a unique take on idolatry in this segment.  
Instead of introducing us to worshippers of a traditional pagan god, he 
gives us a good Polish father who believes in fate and science, but not 
God.  One day, when his young boy wants to go skating, he uses his 
computer to calculate whether the ice on a local pond is thick enough.  
The computer says it's safe, but the boy falls through and drowns.  
DECALOGUE 1 is crafted as an admonition to those who blindly follow any 
philosophy, be it religious or secular, and Kieslowski's ability to make 
these characters believable and sympathetic drives home the message.</P>
<P>     Part Four:  "Honor thy father and thy mother."  A young woman 
prematurely opens a letter addressed to her by her dead mother that was 
intended to be read only after the passing of her father.  In the 
letter, it is revealed that the man who raised her is not the one who 
sired her.  Armed with this knowledge, the daughter decides to act on 
long-submerged feelings to seduce him.  This episode is a study of the 
so-called Electra complex, in which a girl is given the opportunity to 
act on an attraction to her father.  Kieslowski carefully balances 
parental feelings with sexual impulses to come up with a powerful drama 
that questions some of the basic tenants of what it means to be a father 
(or mother).  The ultimate resolution is the perfect ironic punctuation 
to all that comes before.  </P>
<P>     Part Six:  "Thou shalt not commit adultery." (Also, A SHORT FILM 
ABOUT LOVE)  Perhaps the most intriguing of all the episodes, this one 
confronts voyeuristic obsession.  A young postal worker, Tomek, spies on 
a beautiful, promiscuous woman, Magda, living in the tower block 
opposite.  After watching her from afar, he finally gets up the courage 
to meet her, but, by de-objectifying her, his vision of perfect love is 
shattered.  She informs him that there's no such thing as love, only 
sex.  This leads to a failed suicide attempt.  However, by the time 
Tomek returns from the hospital, the circumstances have been reversed.  
Now, Magda is obsessed with him.  Love -- or at least some degree of 
caring -- has awakened inside her even as it was destroyed within him.  
Despite the grim final act, this segment has its lighthearted moments, 
the most memorable of which is Tomek's reaction when Magda agrees to 
accompany him on a date.  The episode is an invitation to speculate 
about the meaning of love, and the different ways people view it.  It's 
also about disillusionment and accepting the consequences of one's 
actions.  Had Magda been more sensitive to Tomek's feelings, she never 
would have been trapped by the emotions that resulted from his attempted 
suicide.</P>
<P>     Certainly, one of the many elements that makes DECALOGUE so 
powerful is that, among the dozens of primary actors, there are NO 
inadequate performances.  Every character is portrayed naturally, and 
each story unfolds without uneven acting creating a question of 
authenticity.  For those familiar with other Kieslowski films, there are 
several recognizable faces.  Zbigniew Zamachowski, who starred in WHITE, 
plays a lead in part 10.  Jerzy Stuhr, from CAMERA BUFF and WHITE, is 
also in the same segment.  Janusz Gajos, from WHITE, is the father in 
part 4.  And Grazyna Szapolowska, Magda in part 6, also appeared in NO 
END.</P>
<P>     Throughout the history of film, there has been a select group of 
standout pictures -- movies that, for technical or artistic reasons, 
have made an indelible imprint on viewers.  Taken as one ten-hour 
exploration of the human experience, DECALOGUE is deserving of a place 
in that unique cadre of films, alongside such undisputed classics as 
CITIZEN KANE, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, LAST TANGO IN PARIS, THE GODFATHER, 
FANNY AND ALEXANDER, and SCHINDLER'S LIST (to name a few).  Make no 
mistake -- ten hours is a long time to watch a movie -- but DECALOGUE's 
drama is never boring (not that I'd recommend viewing the whole thing in 
a single, uninterrupted chunk).  This is the product of a expert 
storyteller/filmmaker at the height of his craft, creating a masterwork 
the likes of which comes along only once in a great while.  There is no 
other motion picture out there like DECALOGUE, which makes it more the 
pity how difficult it is to hunt down in North America.  But, for those 
who take the trouble, the payoff is more than worth the effort.</P>
