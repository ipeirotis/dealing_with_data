<PRE>Lucas (1986)
Review by Larry McGillicuddy 1998
CopyrightLarry McGillicuddy 1998</PRE>
<P>**** (out of 4)
Written and Directed by David Seltzer
Starring Corey Haim, Kerri Green, Charlie Sheen, Winona Ryder, Thomas 
Hodges, Courtney Thorne-Smith, Ciro Popitti, Jeremy Piven</P>
<P>You may not have heard of Lucas, or if you have, you might not think 
much of it. Probably because it stars Corey Haim, or maybe because 
it's about a little geek who collects insects, or maybe because it 
doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack 
albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's. 
However, you have been missing out on a true masterpeice, the best 
film of 1986, and the best film about adolescent life ever made.</P>
<P>Corey Haim stars as Lucas Bligh, a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair,
 thick glasses, and an interest in insects and other outdoor life. 
One day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel 
to him. Her name is Maggie, a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty, 
with lovely red hair and a sweet, innocent complexion. Maggie seems 
to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her, but somehow 
he interests her, and soon they are talking and getting to know one 
another.</P>
<P>They gradually become good friends, and spend the summer together 
doing various things, such as studying insects (namely Locusts, who 
come out of hiding once every 17 years), playing tennis, and 
listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover. Lucas is 
obviously in love with Maggie, and while she is charmed by him, it's 
clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very 
good friend.</P>
<P>This is not clear to Lucas, however. He still beleives that Maggie is 
his soulmate, and he dreads the impending start of school because he 
knows what's about to happen. We soon find out why in a painful scene 
where Lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally. They throw 
him on stage, right in front of his beloved Maggie. Surprisingly, he 
turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around, but he takes 
it too far, and is embarassed in front of the entire school.</P>
<P>The next scene is brilliant. Maggie follows Lucas outside of the pep 
rally. She tries to talk to him as if nothing happened. He rails back 
against her, in a cruel unfair fashion. In lesser movies this 
would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters. But 
Maggie is written smarter than that. She understands what Lucas is 
feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him.</P>
<P>Next we are introduced to another great character named Cappie 
(Charlie Sheen). He is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend. 
What's interesting about him is that he sticks up for Lucas and 
protects him from the other jocks. Of course anyone with a brain can 
tell what's gonna happen next. Cappie will cause conflict in Maggie 
and Lucas' relationship.</P>
<P>This begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when Cappie 
and Maggie are alone. She's been assigned to show him how to operate 
the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt. Maggie is charmed by 
Cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor, not to mention his shirtless 
body. This scene is so delicate and sweet, but Cappie still has a 
girlfriend, preventing either one from acting on their desires. 
Desperately trying to puncture the tension, Cappie begins to kick 
basketballs around the room.</P>
<P>It's not long before Cappie does break up with his girlfriend (in the 
films only subpar scene). Lucas finally figures out what's going on 
when he tries to pick Maggie up for the dance. This causes him to 
take severe actions to prove himself to Maggie and himself, such as 
try out for the football team.</P>
<P>The last third of the film revolves around this attempt. While the 
idea seems cliched, the way it is executed is not. There are many 
surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so 
emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get 
choked up. Dave Grusin's memorable score, played at the perfect 
moments, certainly helps.</P>
<P>Lucas is filled with great performances. Forget everything you know 
about Corey Haim. Back in 1986 he had talent, and that is proven here 
as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with 
anger, humor, and pain. Kerri Green is very appealing as Maggie, 
showing us why she cares about Lucas so much and why he is so 
attracted to her. Sheen's Cappie is almost too good to be true, but 
Sheen makes him beleivable, especially when he explains the reason 
why he protects Lucas. There are other wonderful minor characters 
such as Ciro Popitti's Ben, a friend of Lucas, whose diminutive 
stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks. Also turning 
up in a few key scenes is Winona Ryder as Rina, the girl who admires 
Lucas from afar.</P>
<P>When people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s, you 
hear John Hughes this and John Hughes that. Lucas seems to be lost 
among the crowd of his so-called classics. But hopefully, like with 
Heathers and Say Anything,  Lucas can begin to find it's own loyal 
following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than 
Anthony Michael Hall and Molly Ringwald. It deserves more than that, 
but I don't want to be greedy.</P>
