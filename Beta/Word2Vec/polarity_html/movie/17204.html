<P>The Corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie, complete with
pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence.  It's not abhorrent, or
even blatantly unlikable, but it doesn't make a shred of sense.  And
whose idea was it to have the director of Glengarry Glen Ross direct an
action film?  James Foley knows a lot about characters and acting, and
those are the strengths of The Corruptor.  But the quiet scenes clash
with the ludicrous action nonsense, and the result is less like a movie
and more like a derailed train.</P>
<P>At least we have Chow Yun-Fat in the lead role.  Chow plays Nick Chen,
a Chinatown cop.  He's a good cop, as the first few scenes establish,
and he's very familiar with Chinatown.  That's probably why the
powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named Danny Wallace
(Mark Wahlberg).  Nick and Danny begin by stepping on each other's toes,
but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save
the other one's life.  </P>
<P>What happens after that is kind of a mystery to me.  I'm fairly certain
that the villains are all part of the Fukienese Dragons, led by a young
Chinese psycho named Bobby Vu (Byron Mann).  I'm also pretty sure that
Nick is on the payroll of Henry Lee (Ric Young), a gangster dealing in
prostitutes and other neat stuff.  I'm not quite sure why Henry Lee
decides to employ Danny, although this makes for some ridiculous (albeit
unpredictable) plot twists along the way.  There's also an interesting
subplot revolving around Danny's father (Brian Cox), but it doesn't have
much to do with the main story.</P>
<P>One of the problems, as I said, is that the movie doesn't make any
sense.  I don't blame this entirely on Foley, because he's obviously a
good director.  I'm more inclined to point my finger at Robert Pucci's
script, which doesn't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act. 
One scene early on had me particularly annoyed:  Nick confronts his boss
because he's angry about his new white partner.  He's shouting and
pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture, and I was thinking
that I would have fired him if he had done that to me.  (In addition,
the film takes a bite into race-related issues, and never develops them
at all.)</P>
<P>There are a lot of scenes like this one, and none of them are very
coherent.  There's also a considerable language barrier, given that Chow
and some of the other actors have thick Chinese accents.  The plot
itself never straightens out.  I'm not sure who or what the Fukienese
Dragons are, or why Henry Lee is associated with them, or what they do
as a group.  The Corruptor is an action movie, and so all these weird
plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences. 
The sequences aren't bad, but they're not new; how many car chases
through Chinatown have you seen?  On that note, how many Chinatown cop
movies have you seen?  One too many, I'd imagine.</P>
<P>Foley's strength is clearly in characterization, and he does a pretty
good job here.  The scenes between Nick and Danny are very good, and I
actually got a feel for their characters; a bond forms between them that
holds parts of the film together.  Chow and Wahlberg are both good
actors; Chow is a pro, and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep. 
Wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere, but he's still fun to
watch.  I also liked the subplot involving Danny's father; Brian Cox's
performance is powerful, and his character makes a compelling moral
compass for Danny.  </P>
<P>But the film ultimately fails, mostly at the hands of insane
incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes.  A complicated plot can
be successful, but the story needs to make sense when it's over.  The
Corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out
of control until, finally, there's nothing left to hold on to.</P>
