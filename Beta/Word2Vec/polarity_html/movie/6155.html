<P>     If it does nothing else, THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS will make you 
realize just how brilliant Steven Spielberg's execution of JAWS is.  
Using a similar (albeit land-bound) premise -- hunting down bloodthirsty 
predators -- this movie devolves into a silly series of animal attacks 
and chases.  The camerawork is frenetic and confusing, and the big 
confrontations are as likely to provoke unintentional laughter as edge-
of-the-seat excitement.  </P>
<P>     "Evil lions terrorize workers building a turn-of-the-century 
railroad in Africa" doesn't sound all that promising, but, then again, 
neither does "Giant shark terrorizes vacationers at a quiet seaside 
resort."  In his 1975 thriller, Spielberg proved that the man-against-
beast struggle, if done properly, can make for a compelling motion 
picture.  With THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, director Stephen Hopkins 
tries unsuccessfully to generate the same level of tension.  While 
Hopkins' film making skills aren't of the same caliber as Spielberg's 
(one man made A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 5; the other, SCHINDLER'S LIST), 
the lion's share of the blame for this movie's failure can be laid 
squarely on the shoulders of veteran screenwriter William Goldman, whose 
script is contrived and inadequate.  In JAWS, it was thrilling to watch 
the failed attempts to kill the enemy; here, it's just frustrating.</P>
<P>     THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS takes place during the waning years of 
the nineteenth century, when England, France, and Germany were racing to 
complete the first cross-Africa railroad to facilitate the ivory trade.  
Colonel John Patterson (Val Kilmer), an Irishman with an inconsistent 
accent, is the engineer employed to build England's bridge across 
Uganda's Tsavo River.  As if he doesn't have enough problems with 
feuding, stereotyped workers and a bombastic boss named Beaumont (Tom 
Wilkinson), two man-eating lions begin stalking Patterson's camp.  More 
than one-hundred die, often horribly, including the camp's resident 
evangelist (Brian McCardi), and when Patterson's attempts to kill the 
lions fail, Beaumont calls in an expert hunter, Charles Remington 
(Michael Douglas), to resolve the situation.</P>
<P>     Actually, taken as high camp, it's possible to enjoy THE GHOST AND 
THE DARKNESS on a reasonably consistent basis.  In addition to giving 
Kilmer and Douglas some wonderfully loony lines of dialogue, the script 
spends a lot of time on unnecessarily convoluted schemes to kill the 
beasts.  Then there's Patterson's "ultimate solution" -- take his gun, 
climb on top of a rickety platform, wait for the lion, then, when the 
beast is charging, get knocked off the platform by an aggressive bird.  
Somehow, I don't think Hopkins intended this scene to be as funny as it 
is.</P>
<P>     There is a promising, although largely unexplored, story buried 
within THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS.  Building a railroad bridge across 
the Tsavo River has the potential to generate some potent drama.  Of 
course, THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS is only interested in this material 
as background, so no attempt is made to examine the pressures and 
difficulties of railroad construction.  We're told that the Africans 
don't get along with the Indians, and the Muslims fight with the Hindus, 
but the ramifications of these internal struggles are left unexplored.  
And, man-eating animals aside, what about the inherent difficulties of 
raising such an imposing structure under stringent time and 
environmental constraints?</P>
<P>     The lions in THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, like the shark in JAWS, 
are invested with near-mythical powers.  At first, I thought the film 
makers' reluctance to give us a good, clear view of them was to build 
suspense.  Unfortunately, it becomes clear that the real reason has more 
to do with poor special effects than a desire to tease the audience.  
The animatronic lions look terrible.  (Remember the apes in CONGO?)  One 
wonders why, with all the impressive twisters and spaceships that were 
zipping around on screens this summer, THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS can't 
come up with a pair of credible lions.</P>
<P>     Val Kilmer is either badly miscast, bored, or a combination of the 
two.  His Patterson is dull and largely unsympathetic.  As a hero, he 
leaves a lot to be desired.  Michael Douglas is the exact opposite, 
drawing the camera like a magnet with his over-the-top portrayal of the 
big game hunter, THE GHOST IN THE DARKNESS' answer to Robert Shaw's JAWS 
character.  Unfortunately, Douglas doesn't show up until the film is 
half over, so it's necessary to struggle through the first forty-five 
minutes without his energetic boost.  </P>
<P>     For those who are interested in observing the habits of real lions 
and viewing genuine life-and-death struggles in Africa, I direct your 
attention to THE LEOPARD SON, which is still in theatrical release.  
That well-constructed documentary has stronger drama, tension, and 
cinematography than the supposedly-real story told in THE GHOST AND THE 
DARKNESS.  True, it's missing Tom Wilkinson sneering, Michael Douglas 
smirking, and Val Kilmer looking bored, but no movie can boast 
everything.</P>
