<P>     Late in HOLY SMOKE!, Jane Campion's latest attempt at gender
provocateurship, the principal male character refers to the principal
female character as a "man-hater." The principal female character then
responds that he calls her a man-hater "just because I criticize you." I
would never be so crude as to suggest that Campion is a man-hater, but
it's hard to not to wonder what testosterone-soaked demons haunt her. It's
one thing to ask pointed questions about gender-based power dynamics; it's
quite another to ask those questions using such weighty symbolism that
it's hard not to laugh out loud at the raving significance-mongering of
it all. </P>
<P>     Campion's painfully strident stylings get a workout in HOLY SMOKE!, a
film that gets sillier and less insightful the longer I think about it. 
Kate Winslet stars as Ruth, a young woman from Sydney who begins following
a charismatic guru while travelling in India with a friend. Concerned that
Ruth has been taken in by a "cult," Ruth's family hires one of the world's
most successful "exit counselors," P. J. Walters (Harvey Keitel) to bring
her around again. After luring Ruth back to Australia under false
pretenses, the family leaves her in an isolated cabin with Walters for
three days, where he expects to break her down and build her up again. But
things don't work out quite so simply, leaving both parties searching for
their roles in their strange relationship.</P>
<P>     For a little while, it almost seems that Campion is on to something.
The opening montage, in which Campion sets up Ruth's introduction to
"Baba's" teachings, is an energetic sequence set to Neil Diamond's "Holly
Holy." Better still are the scenes of Ruth's mother (Julie Hamilton) 
visiting Ruth in India, her anxieties betraying the fact that she may be
most concerned about her daughter falling in with dark-skinned people. By
mixing in the racist element with the sexist elements of her story,
Campion promises a film that could have been a fairly complex examination
of exerting power and manifesting fear of "otherness." </P>
<P>     Don't expect anything quite so measured. From that provocative
beginning, HOLY SMOKE! quickly disintegrates into a sluggish, rib-kicking
polemic. Walters is introduced, with little room for misinterpretation, as
a preening and self-important sort who slicks back his dyed hair, receives
oral gratification from Ruth's ditzy sister-in-law (Sophie Lee) and
prepares for his meetings with Ruth with breath spray. Ruth, meanwhile, is
a free spirit whose earth mother dance to "You Oughtta Know" provides all
the ur-femme credentials you could want. Campion seems little concerned
with exploring the side of Ruth that quickly transfers her devotion from
Baba to Walters. She's far more fascinated with the sociological
implications of a woman trying to escape into the wilderness by strapping
books to her feet, or of Ruth and Walters playing a role-reversal game in
which Walters is dressed up in lipstick and a skimpy red dress. For those
of you who think one of cinema's most unnecessary images was Keitel's free
willy in Campion's THE PIANO, please consider Keitel in lipstick and a
skimpy red dress.</P>
<P>     I suppose some viewers could find themselves intrigued enough by the
shifting nature of Ruth and Walters' relationship to give its freakish
elements a pass. I found it far too hard to take HOLY SMOKE! seriously as
anything other than an opportunity for Campion to rattle our collective
cage, whether the image is a nude Ruth urinating in front of Walters or
Walters hallucinating Ruth as a many-armed Indian goddess. It's not so
much shallow as it is garish and over-wrought, an Important Message Movie
without a solid base of characterization to ground it. It has begun to
appear that Campion is more concerned with filming themes than with
filming stories, struggling against oppression without making that
oppression recognizable in human terms. There's no need to use terms like
"man-hating" for that kind of film-making. "Clumsy" just about says it
all.</P>
