<P>     Taylor Hackford's THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE has many laudable qualities, 
but subtlety is not among them.  The story, which postulates that the 
devil is walking among us today, gives Satan's human alter-ego a truly 
obvious name:  John Milton (for those who don't know, he wrote the 
landmark poem about man's expulsion from the Garden of Eden, "Paradise 
Lost").  And, in what is arguably the most believable aspect of the 
movie, THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE takes lawyer-bashing to its logical extreme 
by making Lucifer the head of a prestigious law firm.  Of course, since 
it's fashionable to attack attorneys these days, the zeal with which the 
movie launches into its barrage on the profession (law is referred to as 
Satan's "new priesthood") is guaranteed to strike a responsive chord 
with audiences.  See what I mean -- no subtlety.</P>
<P>     That being said, THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE is a highly-enjoyable motion 
picture that's part character study, part supernatural thriller, and 
part morality play.  Although the film isn't a landmark combination of 
unique elements (viewers will find themselves reminded of both THE 
WITCHES OF EASTWICK and THE FIRM), it has a lot of energy and the rather 
long 145-minute running time passes quickly.  Co-writer Tony Gilroy (THE 
CUTTING EDGE, DOLORES CLAIBORNE), who was brought in by director 
Hackford (DOLORES CLAIBORNE) to expand upon Jonathan Lemkin's original 
adaptation of Andrew Niederman's novel, has produced a script that 
transcends any one specific genre, criss-crossing back and forth from 
horror to satire to melodrama.</P>
<P>     THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE's protagonist is Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), a 
Florida prosecutor-turned-defense attorney who has never lost in more 
than 60 cases.  Kevin's approach to a trial isn't that it's a forum for 
justice, but a game to be won or lost -- and he is willing to do 
anything for victory, even if he knows that his client is guilty (the 
official term for this kind of person is a "sleazeball").  When he 
successfully gains an acquittal for an accused child molester in a 
difficult-to-win case, he attracts the attention of a big-time New York 
lawyer (Ruben Santiago-Hudson), who invites Kevin and his beautiful 
wife, Mary Ann (Charlize Theron), to Manhattan to meet the head of his 
firm.  Once there, Kevin finds himself being offered a very attractive 
job by the charismatic John Milton (Al Pacino).  But John isn't just a 
very powerful attorney and astute businessman -- he's the devil 
incarnate -- and he has special plans for Kevin.</P>
<P>     During the course of his long and varied career, Al Pacino has 
played the good (…AND JUSTICE FOR ALL), the bad (THE GODFATHER), and the 
ugly (SCARFACE), but this is his first chance to play Satan, and he 
accomplishes the task with his usual panache.  Of course, this is the 
kind of over-the-top role that Pacino plays best, and his virtuoso 
performance comes complete with a pair of the kind of monologues that he 
does better than anyone else working in Hollywood today.  Of all the 
recent approaches to this role, Pacino's Dracula-esque method stands 
alongside the work of Jack Nicholson (THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK) and Max 
von Sydow (NEEDFUL THINGS) as the most memorable.</P>
<P>     Although the spotlight shines squarely on Pacino, there are other 
actors in the film.  And, while Pacino's performance is the best, it's 
not the most surprising.  That distinction goes to the work of the 
usually-wooden Keanu Reeves, who is actually believable in his part 
(despite a Southern accent that can best be described as 
"inconsistent").  There are times when Reeves lacks the subtlety that 
would have made this a more multi-layered portrayal, but it's 
nevertheless a solid job.  Spicy Chalize Theron (TRIAL AND ERROR) is 
fine as Mary Ann, bringing equal parts sex appeal and pathos to a 
surprisingly well-developed role.  Supporting players include Judith 
Ivey as Kevin's Bible-thumping mother, Jeffrey Jones as the law firm's 
managing partner, Craig T. Nelson as an "is he or isn't he guilty" 
client, and Connie Nielson as the tempting fruit dangled in front of 
Kevin.</P>
<P>     Aside from Pacino's performance, the greatest strength of the film 
is its delicious build-up to an operatic climax.  And, although huge 
parts of THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE are overblown and overplayed, it's never 
as silly as it has the potential to be -- and this quality consistently 
keeps the picture out of the dangerous realm of self-parody.  The 
movie's greatest weakness is its ending, which, by trying to be too 
clever, ends up cheating the audience of a legitimate conclusion.  While 
there's a sense of closure, it's not an especially satisfying one.</P>
<P>     Oddly enough, with two of the most high-profile horror films of the 
year (SCREAM 2 and AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS) slated for a December 
release, THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE may be the best option for a "Halloween 
flick," and the pairing of Pacino and Reeves should assure it a healthy 
bow at the box office.  It doesn't hurt that the script is more 
intelligent that one might initially suppose and that the storyline is 
developed better than the theatrical previews cause it to appear to be.  
THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE certainly has problems, chief of which is the 
subtlety thing, but Pacino's performance is so fun to watch that it 
eclipses the most significant of them.</P>
