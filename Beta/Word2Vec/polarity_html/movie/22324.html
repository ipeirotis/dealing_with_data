<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A convincingly done documentary-style drama, based on the true story of
Igor Gouzenko (Dana Andrews), a decoder clerk from the Soviet Union, who
is stationed in Ottawa, Canada in 1943 and defects after WW11 with
secrets about the Communist spy operation carried out by the Soviet
Embassy agents. The film seems like a museum piece, about a time that
existed long ago but strangely enough, probably, still exists. It is an
anti-communist story without going overboard over what could be termed
the "red menace," instead focusing in on Igor and his wife Anna (Gene
Tierney) and the love they have for each other and their baby son. We
see how this very simple Russian peasant army man, who is interested
only in following his party's leaders, changes his mind about communism
and seeks asylum in Canada, choosing freedom over everything else.</P>
<P>What the film does very well, is capture the mood of those war time
years and how Russia, an ally of the West, fooled certain people into
thinking they offered a better system of government. In every Communist
office, there was the ominous picture of Josef Stalin to be seen on the
wall, not the friendly picture of George Washington an American
government office might have.</P>
<P>Igor's life in Ottawa is boring and routine, except he is amazed at the
large flat he is able to secure and how happy the Canadian people seem
to be, despite the war going on. His work is clouded in dull secrecy, as
he totally accepts the rigors his superiors put him under, watching his
every move, searching him after he leaves work, telling him to be polite
to his neighbors but not to make friends with them, and forcing
Shostakovich music to be constantly played so as to drown out
conversations in the room.</P>
<P>He comes to Canada accompanied by his superiors, a rigid Colonel
Trigorin (Tozere), a true believer in the Soviet way of life, and Major
Kulin (Eduard Franz), a true cynic, who risks imprisonment to speak his
mind about how little he thinks of the Communist regime. He does this
when he feels brave enough after drinking. The head man in the spy
operation, is Ranov (Schnabel), the chief of the Soviet secret police,
the type who wouldn't give his mother a break if he caught her doing
something wrong, he is dogmatic and identifies himself wholly with the
Communist cause.</P>
<P>For most of the film, Igor keeps his mouth shut, follows orders, and
conforms. Therefore he is well-thought of by the party. He is aware that
the Soviet Embassy is being used for esponiage, stealing secrets about
the Atomic Bomb, stealing secret messages about what the Canadian
government is doing, and building a network of Canadian spies who
idealogically believe in communism and will try to help the Soviet Union
in any way that they can. Their most valuable informer is Dr. Norman
(Joy), who is a lab scientist for the Atomic Energy Project.</P>
<P>The most frightening person, of all the heavies we see trotted out to
depict the morbidness of communism, is a Mr. Grubb (Berry Kroeger), a
Canadian who is masterminding the entire spy network, and who is so
important in the chain-of-command, that he takes his orders only from
Moscow. His best recruit, is a member of Parliament,  Leonard Laetz
(Hugo), who is used to carry the Soviet propaganda into the politics of
the day, trying to gain sympathy for the "red" cause by using
disinformation.</P>
<P>It is only when Igor is being ordered back to Russia, that he realizes
that he doesn't want to leave a free country for a despotic one. He
defects at great risk to himself and his family. At first, no one wants
to listen to his information about a communist spy ring in Canada, as he
goes to the Ministry of Justice and the newspapers, and is faced with
certain assassination by his former countrymen unless the Canadian
government comes to his aid. But when he gives the police the documents
he smuggled out of his workplace, he is welcomed as a hero by the
Canadians.</P>
<P>The film ends as a narrator lists the jail sentences issued to all the
spies Igor gave the Canadians documented proof on, giving in detail the
number of years each has to serve in prison. But it also closed on the
bitter-sweet note that Igor's family was fortunately granted Canadian
citizenship, but will still have to live the rest of their life under
police protection.</P>
<P>The story is told in a dry, matter-of-fact style, with the B&W
photography adding a gritty feel to the secretive work environment and
the snow-capped streets of Ottawa. This picture had the look of
something that was important, but it didn't have more to say than what
any reasonable person could already assume about the Soviet Union. The
film works only as a mild tonic works for someone who can drink all he
wants and know that he can't get drunk from what he is drinking.</P>
