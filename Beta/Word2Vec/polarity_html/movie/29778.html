<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>At last, a black comedy, coming-of-age, romantic melodrama about teenagers in
rebellion that is not a formulaic clichéd one and actually makes an attempt to
flesh out the character of a teen who is searching for something that is not
trivial, as she lashes back at being stuck in the urban sprawl scene of LA that
is inhabitated by so many shallow and phony people. It's filmed by documentary
filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, a nerd himself, who gave us the excellent documentary
Crumb. Ghost World is based on Daniel Clowes's underground comic book
series--though the story is dramatically expanded. The comic book drawings were
done by Robert Crumb's daughter Sophie. He, of course, is the great comic book
illustrator. </P>
<P>It's a film that best captures the uncertainty in the life of a very bright
recent high school graduate who is a misfit, Enid (Thora Birch). She uses
intellectual barbs and pure scorn to fend off her foes who are: anyone new she
meets, waiters, would-be friends and even her appeasing single-parent dad
(Balaban) and his girlfriend (Garr) she can't stomach because of her pushiness.
She saves most of her wrath for her vacuous high school classmates, all of whom
are preoccupied either with going to college, fitting into society or going
straight into the serious workforce. She and her girlfriend Rebecca (Johansson)
choose not to go to college, get involved with boys, or plan for a career. They
are close high school friends who will soon have a more distant relationship as
they have different needs and can't keep up their intense friendship when out of
the school environment--which gave them their common enemy: the high school. </P>
<P>Enid has one obstacle before getting her high school diploma, she must go to
summer school to take a remedial art appreciation course she failed. She's
saddled with a gooey teacher (Illeana Douglas) who makes art secondary to
conforming with society, as she praises the students who create safe politically
correct art works rather than praising those who take risks and create works of
art. She promises much to Enid and, as one might expect, delivers little. </P>
<P>Rebecca who is attractive and Aryan looking, but who identifies with the Jewish
Enid, decides to work at a pretentious coffee shop and get an apartment with
her. Enid, meanwhile, fumbles a popcorn vender job in a movie theater by
mistreating the customer's she hates and spends the summer mischievously
searcing for something that she doesn't even know she's looking for. </P>
<P>The main plot develops out of a tasteless joke the girls play on a loser, who
put an ad in the personals of a local newspaper for the blonde woman he met at
the airport to call him. Enid calls pretending to be that woman and leaves a
message on his answering machine to meet her at a vintage '50s retro diner. The
girlfriends get Josh (Renfro), a classmate now working at a counter job at a
convenience shop, to go with them to the diner and see what this dwork looks
like. He turns out to be a sad loner named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), whom they
follow home. When she meets this much older man whose passion is collecting
valuable 78 rpm records of old-fashioned country and blues music and old
advertising art, she's surprised that they have similar socially unacceptable
personalities that are unbending and vulnerable--which makes it very difficult
for them to have relationships. She's, at last, met her kindred soulmate, but
they are both such social misfits that even that recognition might not be enough
to bring them together. He tells her he obsessively collects things to make up
for not having relationships with others. At first goofing on him, she soon
decides to help him find a woman to date and when the real Dana he put the ad in
the paper for calls--she gets him to call her. But soon becomes jealous when she
realizes that she really wanted to go out with him and now tries to destroy this
budding relationship. It is one that Seymour is willing to have even if it means
he has to compromise all his beliefs to keep it going, as he curiously says "I
don't want to meet someone who shares my interests. I hate my interests." </P>
<P>He works days at a nondescript managerial office job for a fast food chicken
place, that he tells her once had the racist name of Coon's Chicken but changed
to Cooks to avoid any controversy. </P>
<P>Through his unapologetic loneliness she sees her own, and even though this film
is not geared for a predictable or a happy ending, it's this relationship with
all its incongruities that is so fascinating, touching and tender to behold. It
certainly sharpened their awareness of who they were, and the poetical ending is
fitting for a free flowing story like this one. I honestly can't remember how
long its been since I have seen a teenage film as memorable as this one
(Rushmore comes the closest). </P>
