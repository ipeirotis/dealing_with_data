<P>Ok, so there are movies that come out that are just soooo guiltily 
entertaining, that you really cant suffice it and say that movie was good. Ok 
so maybe "Romeo Must Die" isn't one of those movies, but it isn't perfect by 
any means. Hong Kong films are always technically well-made, bloody, violent, 
lightning-paced fist fight, no plot movies. The one exception is "Romeo Must 
Die" a very entertaining, fast-paced thrill ride, that will have you cheering 
by the end, and a smile permanently on your face throughout the two hours.</P>
<P>Jet Li plays a man who is an ex-cop just escaped from prison to find his 
brother's killer in New York. He meets up with singing sensation Aayliah who 
gives a better than you'd think performance. Jet Li plays a Romeo type who is 
avenging his brother's killer, while Aayliah plays a Juliet type trying to 
cope with the fact that her father is a mob boss, and may be responsible for 
the killing of 'Romeo's' brother. The two team up and try to find out the 
truth, leading to a huge finale and some shocking secrets. </P>
<P>What seems like a thin plot type movie, really is. There is a nice solid plot 
to this movie, though it seems like it has been done so many times before, it 
isn't even funny. The Romeo And Juliet modern day tale, is just that. Man 
loves Woman, Woman loves Man, they can't be together because of their 
families fighting, and their families do not want them to be together. Even 
watching this film, you know your treading familiar water, the fight scenes, 
action, and acting in the film especially by Aayliah makes you overlook that 
stuff, and just enjoy yourself.</P>
<P>Surprisingly enough, Aayilah gives the best performance in the movie, backed 
up great performances from Jet Li, Delroy Lindo and Isaiah Washington, "Romeo 
Must Die" is a brainless action film, with some brains and sometimes no 
action. The film goes from being an action film to a love story, to an action 
film to a love story, yet never loses it's punch to make us the viewer 
continue to like this movie. We are brought to these characters lives, their 
loves, they adventures and their tragedies. Even with all these flaws, "Romeo 
Must Die" continues its way to be a fast-paced thrill ride, that grabs hold 
of the viewer and does not let go until the end credits role.</P>
<P>The cinematography and directing were both flawless, but the script could 
have used some polishing. Of course expect the usual subtitles, but no 
dubbing (yay). This is an American made film, that will appeal to all races: 
White, Black, Oriental, there is something in this movie for everyone, and 
everyone will find something that will appeal to them. Even if the person 
didn't like the movie, I found those people did like something in the movie 
that was memorable. The fight scenes in the movie were more than incredible, 
and some of these stunts are the most amazing martial arts I have ever seen 
on a film strip. Without the fight scenes and the overall entertainment of 
the film, there really isn't much to Romeo Must Die. But when you put those 
aside, you get one fun and wild ride!</P>
