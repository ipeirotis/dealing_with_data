<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A feel-good, old-fashioned (except for all the cuss words), liberal
message movie for the people and by the people, resulting in a populist
film. It surprised me in how invigorating a performance there was from
Julia Roberts (she usually turns me off), and how there was such a good
chemistry between her and the gruff Albert Finney. He is a sleazy lawyer
and her boss. She stole all the scenes in the film (she was paid 20
million bucks to be a star). But, the subtle performance by the rumpled
looking Finney, playing second fiddle without a hint of a complaint, as
his panned reactions to her antics made her star quality shine more
brightly, was the key to the film's success.</P>
<P>This true story tells how the Julia Robert's character, Erin Brockovich,
collected evidence against a giant California utility company, Pacific
Gas and Electric, and even though she has no formal training as a lawyer
and is uneducated, her firm, mainly through her persistent efforts, was
able to win the largest U.S. settlement ever paid in a direct-action
lawsuit: $330 million.</P>
<P>Erin, as the twice-divorced mother of three toddlers, shakes her ass,
exposes her boobs, and manages to stop her rotten luck by landing a job
in the same law firm she came to as a client in a car accident. She was
hit by a rich doctor who was speeding through a street crossing.
Appearing in court for the lawsuit, wearing a neck brace, she
nevertheless loses her slam-dunk case, when the opposing lawyer baits
her to react with a volley of curse words on the stand. Straddled with
bills, the former beauty queen from Wichita, bullies the boss, Ed Masry
(Finney), into giving her a chance to work there as a secretary, but
without benefits.</P>
<P>Erin's desperate life as a single parent revolves around her trying to
be a good mother to her children. But her dependable baby-sitter moves
out and the next one she hires is not dependable. Her new next-door
neighbor turns out to be a Harley biker enthusiast, George (Aaron). He
is attracted to her and doesn't seem to be daunted when she tells him of
her meager bank account and all her children. He ends up being her
boyfriend and baby-sitter. His role is a paper-thin one, as the
sensitive, long-suffering lover. It reminds me of the role Hollywood
usually reserves for the sweet but simple lady co-star, who is just
around to make the star look good.</P>
<P>Erin has a quick-wit, a winning smile, a sewer for a mouth, is
impulsive, is willing to show her cleavage, and can sexily flaunt her
feminine assets in the faces of all the men she encounters without
having to be a slut. Julia Roberts's breasts are propped up and very
noticeable, wearing tight-fitting clothes with low necklines, at all
times. When told by the boss "You might want to rethink your wardrobe a
little," She retorts, "I think I look nice, and as long as I have one
ass instead of two, I'll wear what I like."</P>
<P>She soon stumbles upon something fishy in a pro bono case the boss asks
her to look at. There are medical records in the file of this real
estate case, which strikes her as being odd. The boss, whose small law
firm mainly does ambulance-chasing work, gives her permission to go see
Donna Jensen (Marg), and when there, Erin finds out about the family's
sickness due to the toxic hexavalent chromium in the water and of the
utility company paying all the medical bills, as long as the family goes
to the company's doctor.</P>
<P>It turns out that the gas company is evilly hiding the fact that it has
polluted the ground water and is apparently responsible for death and
disease, for hundreds of people living in that hard-working community of
Southern California.</P>
<P>Erin spends the rest of the film making house calls on the victims,
rounding them up for the class-action suit, and juggling her home life
with her new career. The film was all about her. It plays pompously
proud of itself like the do-gooder fare it is, with no real emotions
shown for the victims, as it only shows the pain Julia feels for them.
This one's all about Julia Roberts, and if you buy into her for the
part, you are more than likely to be pleased with the film. As for my
reaction, I felt, what the hell, the utility company acted so
maliciously evil and the outcome of the case is documented, so what I
would not have accepted so readily from a drama, I found myself
accepting in this political conscience film. Where I saw the film, the
same type of working-class clients of Julia's, were in the audience and
were laughing lustily at the jokes, and they seemed to enjoy seeing this
big company being taking on by one of them.</P>
<P>This mainstream film by Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies and Videotape/Out
of Sight/The Limey), is shot in a sitcom conventional style, without
most of the director's usual artististic flourishes from his past films.
There have been many Hollywood films of this type, including, Silkwood,
A Civil Action, and Norma Rae, with this film somewhere in the middle of
the entertainment scale when held in comparison.</P>
