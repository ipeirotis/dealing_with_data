<PRE>                                FLESH AND BONE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan, James Caan, Gwyneth Paltrow.
Screenplay/Director:  Steve Kloves.</P>
<P>     It's about fifteen minutes into FLESH AND BONE before you see the
first speck of sunlight, or hear the first note of underscore.  In
fact, there's almost no movement or sound of any kind.  It's clear from
the outset that writer/director Steve Kloves (THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS)
is going for a dark and moody feel.  However, there's moody, and then
there's comatose.  FLESH AND BONE is the perfect example of a solid
story choking nearly to death on its own atmosphere.</P>
<P>     FLESH AND BONE opens with a rural Texas family taking in an
apparently homeless boy for the night.  In fact, the boy is the son of
a thief who has fequently pulled this con, letting his dad into homes
after everyone is asleep.  This time, the robbery is botched and three
members of the family are slain, leaving only an infant girl.  Thirty
years later, grown-up Arlis Sweeney (Dennis Quaid) is eking out a
living running a vending machine supply business, content with a
simple, predictable life.  While on a job, he meets Kay Davies (Meg
Ryan), a runaway wife jumping drunkenly out of a cake at a bachelor
party.  Arlis brings Kay along on his rounds, and an attraction grows.
Trouble also grows when Papa Roy (James Caan) reappears, linked up with
a slick young grifter (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Despite every attempt to
distance himself from his past, Arlis finds himself drawn into his
father's obsession with tying up loose ends.</P>
<P>     At the heart of FLESH AND BONE is an intriguing character in an
intriguing premise.  Arlis Sweeney is a man desperately trying to
convince himself that he's not like his father, trying to live out his
days meekly as a personal penance for whatever crimes he might have
been party to.  He feels completely unworthy of the too-trusting Kay,
giving their relationship a nice dynamic.  Unfortunately, Dennis Quaid
is playing Arlis.  As charming as he can be, Quaid simply doesn't have
the dramatic range necessary to dig into this complicated character;
when he should be looking introspective and guilt-ridden, he just looks
stiff.  I was left imagining a Jeff Bridges in the role, and what might
have been given a more versatile actor.</P>
<P>     Other aspects of the performances also left me unsatisfied.  Meg
Ryan has the light touch required for the film's few moments of humor,
but she doesn't quite strike the balance of strength and accumulated
pain required for this role.  James Caan has a surprisingly small part,
given his prominence in the advertising campaign, and never quite hits
his stride.  His performance is too mannered, full of odd jaw movements
and rolled eyes.  It's a major drawback, because Caan's Roy is supposed
to be FLESH AND BONE's living manifestation of evil, and he's nowhere
near threatening enough.  Surprisingly, the best performance is turned
in by Gwyneth Paltrow as the savvy Gennie, but it's hard to figure what
purpose her character serves, other than perhaps to remind Arlis of
what he could be.</P>
<P>     For all the problems with the acting, it's another issue entirely
that proves to be FLESH AND BONE's ultimate undoing:  it's positively
snore-inducing.  At two hours and ten minutes, it's at *least* twenty
minutes too long.  The second act is interminable, chock full of scenes
best left on the cutting room floor, like Kay's confrontation with her
husband (apparently a refugee from THELMA AND LOUISE).  There were
establishing shots which lasted twice as long as necessary, and
meaningful pauses which weren't very meaningful.  To make matters
worse, there were two minute stretches of dialogue between Caan and
Quaid which were practically indecipherable (I'm not sure whether to
blame the sound mixing or the theater for that one).  In live theater,
there is an expression:  "Tighten it up." What FLESH AND BONE needed
was a good tightening up.</P>
<P>     The tone that FLESH AND BONE is going for is fully achieved.  The
West Texas locations are expertly captured by cinematographer Phillippe
Rousselot, and the spare score by Thomas Newman has a nice edgy feel.
Everything is working towards a grim tension, and it succeeds, but
tension requires release and it's there that FLESH AND BONE doesn't
deliver.  Thanks to an ill-conceived ad campaign, one of the film's key
plot points is given away in the trailers, blowing one of those release
points for anyone who has seen them.  There is a great deal of craft to
the broad strokes of FLESH AND BONE.  However, in this tale of evil,
the devil is truly in the lack of details.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 guilty memories:  4.</PRE>
