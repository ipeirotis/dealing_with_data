<PRE>INSPECTOR GADGET
*1/2 (out of five stars)
A review by Jamey Hughton</PRE>
<PRE>Starring-Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett,
Joely Fisher and Michelle Trachtenberg
Director-David Kellogg
Rated G
Released July 1999
Walt Disney</PRE>
<P>Do the folks at Disney have no common decency? They have resurrected yet
another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive
special effects, embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick. Wasn't
Mr. Magoo enough, people?</P>
<P>Obviously not. Inspector Gadget is not what I would call ideal family
entertainment. Younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding
goofiness, but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping
over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in
glaring stupidity. The movie is poorly edited, grossly manipulative, and
the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle. All
the elements are there, but the manner in which director David Kellogg
pieces them together is laughable and trite.</P>
<P>As a huge fan of the 80's animated TV show, the first thing I must
express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain. In the
cartoon, Dr. Claw was a frightening, raspy-voiced presence who remained
a total mystery to the viewer. We never saw his face; he simply sat back
in his arm-chair, watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his
loyal cat. As a child, I always imagined what Dr. Claw would appear as -
and this curiosity kept me watching for many years. With the release of
the live-action movie, the face of this once intriguing villain has been
unrightfully exposed - it's... Rupert Everett?! Only now, Dr. Claw is
simply known as Claw (`One word,' he explains, `like Madonna'). He
sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove, and seems far less
interesting than the animated version. It helps that the dashing Everett
is enthusiastic, but he overplays the role entirely too far. When all is
said and done, this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the
screenwriters - the infamous Dr. Claw has been turned into a
wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and
cool. He does still have his cat, though.</P>
<P>In the title role, Matthew Broderick looks lost. The actor, while
usually downright charming, doesn't know exactly where to take his
character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers.
Broderick first plays a friendly, naive security guard named John Brown,
who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the
people. He has a mad crush on pretty scientist Brenda (Joely Fisher),
who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction
of human tissue and electronics. But one fateful night, her lab is
destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire
(Everett) who wants to take over the world. John courageously pursues
the limousine from the scene of the crime, but loses the chase when his
vehicle bursts into flames. In a full body cast, he is chosen to be the
first human prototype for Brenda's work; a revolutionary crime fighting
tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys. And so is born
Inspector Gadget.</P>
<P>As bad as this movie is, it does have a certain charm in isolated
scenes. Broderick actually fares better playing Robo Gadget, an evil and
destructive clone that Claw has set loose on the city. And there are
about two or three amusing punch lines, the funniest being when Robo
Gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick
wall, and a Japanese man flees the scene while screaming, `This is why I
left Tokyo!' Alas, the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in
favor of not even cracking a slight giggle. There are so many tired plot
additions. Gadget's talking car (voiced by D.L. Hughley) is the same
type of character as Zoot the suit from My Favorite Martian. Both are
wisecracking, non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller
children. Well, it just doesn't work (in fact, Zoot functioned
marvelously in comparison to this). And don't even get me started about
the villains. I didn't mind Everett's performance, but his bumbling
assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust.</P>
<P>The characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless
supporting roles. Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Brain the dog now
have little to do with the action, and Chief Quimby (Dabney Coleman) has
lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action.
The special effects are everywhere, but not so annoying they will cause
your eyes to peel over. The problem here lies solely in the script.
Perhaps the next time Disney attempts a remake like this, they will
invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals. Here is
one critic crossing his fingers, anyway.</P>
