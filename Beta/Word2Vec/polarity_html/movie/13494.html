<PRE>TERROR TRAIN
A film review by Andrew Hicks
Copyright 1998 Andrew Hicks</PRE>
<PRE>(1980) *1/2 (out of four)</PRE>
<P>        There were four movies that earned Jamie Lee Curtis the title 
of "scream queen" in the early '80s. Two of them were HALLOWEEN 
movies, but the other two -- PROM NIGHT and TERROR TRAIN -- were the 
uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of HALLOWEEN. 
The same "God, I'm scared, there's some guy in a mask coming after 
me" routine she did in John Carpenter's classic, Jamie Lee copies here, 
with none of the urgency or suspense.</P>
<P>        TERROR TRAIN takes place on (where else?) a train, charted by 
some pre-med students finishing their first four years of higher 
education. Most of them won't make it to med school, though, and it's 
obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains, 
"I wish to hell they'd put a radio on that train." The conductor 
character probably has the most lines of anyone, even Jamie Lee. From 
the beginning, he's talking his head off (He tells one of his co-workers 
"Think on this -- when's the last time someone built a shopping mall 
next to a train station?" as if it makes any kind of sense) and it only 
gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of 
railroad over recreational vehicles. Of course, the loudmouth 
conductor is the first person to find a bloody body, which is then gone 
when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it.</P>
<P>        I forgot to mention the prologue. It's a party three years 
earlier, with the same group of students. Two of them play a trick on a 
geeky frat pledge, promising him he's going to get laid. They send 
Jamie Lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes 
in, noticing a form on the bed. She says, "Kiss me, Kenny," and he 
kisses the body on the bed, which happens to be a cadaver. ("Oh my 
God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!") It's a sick trick, and one 
Jamie Lee wasn't let in on. She still hasn't forgiven the guy as they 
board the terror train ("You asshole, you can't have a good time 
without hurting somebody!").</P>
<P>        The killing starts before the train even leaves the station. 
Since it's New Year's, everyone's wearing disguises (a convenient plot 
device we've seen before), and someone stabs the guy in the Groucho 
mask when no one's looking. At least one of the characters says it's a 
Groucho mask; when the killer dons it and steps aboard, it looks like 
Gene Shalit who, by the way, would make a great killer in a slasher 
movie. Speaking of weird-looking dorks who still persist on the 
entertainment scene, one of TERROR TRAIN's most famous gimmicks is 
the appearance of David Copperfield "as The Magician," who regails 
those aboard with illusions set to disco music. Then there's his greatest 
trick -- getting laid with hair that looks like that.</P>
<P>        For all its attempts at visual style and substance, TERROR TRAIN 
is more Lionel than Amtrak, more PROM NIGHT than HALLOWEEN, and 
nothing really worth watching. Only die-hard fans of Jamie Lee Curtis 
and David Copperfield (if he truly has any fans) should even attempt 
to watch it. And it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an RV 
could be much worse. I mean, when was the last time someone built a 
shopping mall next to a train station, anyway? TERROR TRAIN is 
definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car.</P>
