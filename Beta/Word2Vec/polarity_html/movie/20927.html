<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Probably the best of the Charlie Chan's starring the Swedish born Warner
Oland in the  feature role. He played the Charlie Chan role a total of
15 times (three others played it before he took over the role in 1931),
with this film being his 13th performance. After his death in 1938,
Sidney Toler (the second best to Oland) took over and was a more than
competent replacement, his best Charlie Chan feature arguably being
Charlie Chan at Treasure Island (1939). Chan is based on a real-life
Chinese detective named Chang Apana, living in Honolulu, Hawaii, but
embellished by the writing efforts of Earl Derr Biggers. Chan's
technique in wrapping up a murder case, was to gather all suspects in
one room and have the murderer confess when all the evidence weighed
against him or her.</P>
<P>This film is distinguished by Oscar Levant creating an opera for it
called Carnival and William Kernell doing the libretto. It also has a
fine cast of character actors, with Boris Karloff playing a former opera
baritone named Gravelle, who supposedly died in an opera house fire 7-
years ago in Chicago when he was locked in his dressing room. He now has
amnesia and is in a loony bin in Los Angeles.</P>
<P>The film features the Confucian-like sayings of wisdom from Charlie and
the acidly made retorts from the cops and suspects, in a battle of who
can come up with the deadliest one-liner. Charlie is played with a
subtle grace and aplomb by Oland, giving the film its life-force.</P>
<P>The film opens as Gravelle is playing the piano, when he is interrupted
by the mental institution guard who brings him the Los Angeles
newspaper. Gravelle becomes upset when he sees a picture of his former
wife Lilli Rochelle (Margaret Irving) in the newspaper, announcing that
she will appear in the opening of the opera Carnival, and he angrily
stomps his heel down on her picture, indicating his memory has suddenly
come back to him and he overpowers the guard, telling him he must
escape.</P>
<P>After unsuccessfully setting up a dragnet for the escaped lunatic, the
police inspector, Regan (Guy Usher), calls in his old friend Charlie
Chan to help, as the cynical veteran of the force, Sergeant Kelly
(William Demarest) makes some wise-cracks about why do we need this "egg
foo young" private eye to help us. Soon, Lilli appears in the police
station with the lead baritone singer of the opera, Enrico Borelli
(Gregory Gaye), and asks for police protection, after telling them she
received flowers backstage with a note that said: You will die tonite.
Lilli is seen being followed from the police station by a private
detective who works for her husband, Mr. Whitely (Frank Conroy), who
suspects her of having an affair with Borelli.</P>
<P>To help Charlie out, his number one son, Lee Chan (Keye Luke, he played
Kato in the Green Hornet), disguises himself as a cast member extra and
snoops around the opera house, passing fingerprint clues to his father
and creating some daffy comedy with the flustered Sergeant Kelly, who is
trying to track down the vengeful lunatic spotted in the theater by one
of the wardrobe workers.</P>
<P>The plot thickens when a young couple, Kitty (Charlotte Henry) and
Childers (Thomas Beck), insist on visiting Lilli but are denied access
to her by the ever-vigilant and wrong-headed Sgt. Kelly. Gravelle also
visits the dressing room of Lucretia Borelli (Nedda Harrigan), telling
her to keep quiet, he will replace her baritone husband and sing the
lead role in tonight's opera opening. Being angry with her philandering
husband and dismayed with Lilli, she agrees to keep quiet, as Gravelle
knocks Borelli out and goes on-stage replacing him. This is too much for
Lilli, who recognizes her former husband after being certain he was dead
and passes out. She is being cared for by her husband, who only leaves
her for a minute, but when he returns she is knifed to death, as was
Borelli.</P>
<P>But Charlie Chan uses the power of deduction and good old police work,
to narrow down the list of suspects to either the lunatic Gravely, the
jealous Mr. Whitely, or the embittered soprano, Mrs. Borelli. He
eliminates the young couple as suspects when he finds out that she's the
daughter of Gravely and Lilli, and only came to see her mother to get
permission to marry because she's underage. Her mother refuses to
acknowledge the child, figuring it might ruin her career.</P>
<P>The film had a convincing atmosphere and style about it, and it had the
peerless Boris doing his chilling loony thing with great relish. To
enjoy it, one must overlook quite a few gaps in the story; such as,
Boris' sudden recovery from amnesia, it was never made clear why someone
would want to kill him in a fire, and why the police would put out a
dragnet for an escaped mental patient who showed no signs of ever being
violent. But let's forget the story, this film is fun in an
old-fashioned way, and it's many pearls of wisdom that come forth, such
as Charlie explaining how a madman and a genius are sometimes similar
because they both live in a world created by their ego. Now how can you
beat that for Hollywood's Oriental-style of profundity!</P>
