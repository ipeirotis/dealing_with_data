<P>Though I liked this movie overall, though there are some outstanding shots,
sequences, and effects, and though I would probably recommend it to friends
and acquaintances as one of the better cinema treatments about World War II,
my expectations were too disappointed to engage in high praise of this work. 
I had many serious "problems" with SPR from the very opening shot of the
American flag.        This image, which was also used at the end as a frame,
imparted upon the movie a kind of amoral "patriotism" which politically I do
not share, and which actually contradicted itself, in my opinion, during the
entire film.  In other words, either Spielberg was making some sort of subtle
sarcastic/ironic comment with this flag shot (which would "work" for me
within the context of the film itself), or he wasn't.  I suspect the latter.</P>
<P>The opening scene of Ryan as an old man visiting the Normandy cemetery was
fine except for one very annoying factor, which was to excruciatingly
reappear throughout the film, the music.  It was archetypal John Williams,
lush, overly-sentimental BS pretension, which we've heard 100 times already,
and in almost every scene in which this score swelled, I felt it was
inappropriate.        I would've much rather have heard no music whatsoever
throughout the film, or at least a very different style, from another
composer.  Some of the scenes in the film in which Williams' score was most
evident (and annoying), were very powerful and emotionally tugging in
themselves, and no music at all was needed. At the very least, an utterly
subtle form, quiet and unassuming, would've worked nicely.  However, with
most Spielberg films, and most John Williams scores, "subtle" is obviously
not in their respective dictionaries.</P>
<P>For instance, when we are in DC with the military brass, or when Ryan's
mother is being notified of her other three son's deaths, the music is quite
overblown and ridiculous.  Sometimes, it almost smothers the actual dialogue.
 I don't really like being manipulated like this.  The scene where an army
notification car rode up to mother Ryan's home, as she fell to her knees when
a priest tried to comfort her, was very powerful stuff.  Why not just leave
it that way without this obtrusive, blaring soundtrack of trite music we've
heard over and over again?  One could've easily substituted this entire
soundtrack for the ET score, for Jurassic Park, for virtually ANY Spielberg
film really.</P>
<P>I mention and highlight the music because this is an example of where the
film goes wrong for me, seriously wrong. Each time the soundtrack music
swelled like it did, it completely ruined my experience of the sometimes
overwhelming visuals.  It also completely destroyed my "suspension of
disbelief" that I was actually watching just another war movie, and this is
the film's main failing for me.  SPR tries to be two things at once, a "real"
glimpse of war, and a typical Hollywood piece of entertainment.  Perhaps this
duality isn't really possible when touching upon the reality and horror of
war, but I do think other films have given it a much better shot than SPR. 
The most striking example of the film's almost soulless failure to do justice
to its apparent agenda (to show how utterly abominable real war is), brings
me to perhaps my main complaint. The film's cinema verite, shaky documentary
camera style.  NYPD Blue on amphetamines...</P>
<P>A little of this "style" can go a long way.  Drenching entire scenes lasting
several minutes, was totally ineffective and pretentious to me.  Like the
stereotypical Williams score swells, the jerky camera was so overdone and
manipulative, that it seemed to undercut itself finally.  Some of this
specific technique is fine, in the right place, the right time, and used
sparingly to highlight something in particular about the image which the
director is trying to point our attention to.  But in the numerous combat
sequences in SPR where it was completely appropriate and where it should have
been effective, it was so collateral, that the camera style itself
overwhelmed the content and power of the images.  Several times, I really
felt so beleaguered, that I wish I could've reached up onto the screen and
just stabilized the shot for a moment. Generally, I am suspicious of
Spielberg's motivation for doing this in the first place.  In many ways, this
is a "false" and outdated "style" to begin with, and its use should always be
frugal, if used at all.  In short time, SPR's constant camera jerkiness
becomes superfluous to the point of actually undercutting the meaning
intended for its use in the first place.</P>
<P>I had other problems.  From the start, I felt Tom Hanks as lead was a bad
choice.  His performance was great, don't get me wrong.  I loved his acting
throughout.  But the whole "documentary" type feel which Spielberg constantly
kept trying to hit us over the head with throughout the film, was constantly
undercut for me, by seeing a well known actor in the part.  An unknown
should've gotten this part, actually, all of the parts.  Hey, it's been done.
 Would Spielberg do it though?        Would Paramount go for it?  Hardly.  It was
all part of some complex "deal," of course.  More Hollywood marketing, what's
going to sell, what isn't.  Star appeals, profit margins, "business."  And
yet, didn't the whole concept of SPR in a way, call for something more than
just another "vehicle" by which Hanks will possibly grab another of those
oscar statues? There are 10's of 1000's of OTHER actors in Hollywood, with
just as much "talent" as Hanks, I am sure.  Why not give them one of them a
shot at this? Why spend so much money trying to convince an audience that
they are watching something "real," then thrust into our consciousness good
ol' Forrest Gump again?</P>
<P>The problem is, that like the music, like the shaky camera, and like the
"patriotism" expressed, the images and subject matter, which "deserved"
something much better, were undercut by Tom Hanks in the lead.        I very rarely
ever believed what Spielberg was trying so hard to get me to believe with the
great images, sets, and action sequences he stages.  Even at the end, when
Hanks is sitting there dying and shooting a gun at a Tiger tank, I saw Tom
Hanks, actor, "best actor." At one point, Ted Danson appears.  Again, an
unknown actor should've played this.  I hardly heard a word Hanks or Danson
said during their brief encounter, nor did I believe they were soldiers, nor
did I accept any longer the reality of the destroyed French town they were
walking through.  It suddenly just became a "set" again.  My suspension of
disbelief, which so many powerful scenes in the film evoke, was broken once
more.  Hey, there's the guy on Cheers, I said to myself.  It is true that
Spielberg casts some unknowns (or hardly-knowns) in other roles, but even
then, their characters are so stereotyped that the unfamiliar faces never got
in the way of feeling at all times that I was simply watching a Hollywood
movie.</P>
<P>Within all of this criticism, one may have noticed some positives mentioned.
Yes, there were many.  Some of the wobbly camera in the opening sequence, was
very potent, like the troops running towards the beach.  This gave the viewer
a real sense of being there, of being in a frantic state of confusion,
attempting to move forward into a frightening and imposing blur of horror and
motion. However, a bit later, when Hanks and his men are using a mirror at
the end of a rifle to try to find out where a particular German machine gun
is firing from, why shake the camera?  When the medics are trying to fix up
wounded men on the beach, why shake the camera?  If one were there watching
these things, they would simply not be seeing it from this perspective. 
Again, this whole technique was so overused to me, that it eventually
subverted its intended purpose.  Why?  Is this just typical over the top
Spielberg?  Were the horrible images in themselves not horrible enough that
we needed this constant "gimmick" thrown in our faces over and over again? 
Was such blatant manipulation of his audience really necessary?  Like the
music, the shaky camerawork, for this viewer at least, ended up simply
interfering with the effect on me I think Spielberg himself intended.  In
many ways, SPR seemed like Spielberg shooting himself in the foot, to escape
the real horror he said he wanted to convey all along.        I have to seriously
wonder why.  Was he "afraid" to show us what he was certainly capable of
about the reality of war?  Or would that not be "entertainment" any longer? 
Would it not be part of the "deal," or would it cut into potential profits? 
Of course.  But oh, what a shame and a cop out.  And so even when trying to
concentrate on "positives" in SPR, I am again drawn to criticize it.</P>
<P>What's so disappointing about SPR is that it just could've been done so much
better, in so many areas, that the collective result, is frustrating.  One of
the most notable exceptions when Spielberg seemed to "get it right," was one
"sound dissolve" early in the film, which really sent chills through me. 
This was when he showed it beginning to rain, the drops falling onto leaves,
trees, and ponds, the sound of which slowly changed into that of approaching
gunfire and bombs, which it all turned into soon visually.  The sound editing
was generally great in SPR, however, that distinctive "sound dissolve" was
fantastic.  One visual gem around that time in the film, also stood out for
me, which was a shot of the men walking on a hill, silhouetted against a blue
dawn sky filled with distant (and not so distant) mortar and bomb blasts. 
My, if only more of the film could've held such qualities.  It would've then
easily approached "Apocalypse Now" (my all time favorite "war" film) and
achieved true "masterpiece" status.  It is interesting to compare the two
films actually, if only in intent and success.        "Apocalypse Now" clearly
attempts with each shot, each element, to be flowing in some uniform whole,
all to portray war as utter madness.  On that level, it is clearly unequaled
in my opinion, and succeeds brilliantly in what it tries to do.  SPR on the
other hand, whose clear intent seems to be to show us how horrible war is,
cloaks that horror in typical Hollywood cliché and hokum, ending up not only
doing disservice to its very subject, but undercutting its own effectiveness.
 The two examples in SPR given above, the sound dissolve and the silhouette
image, were only hints of what greatness Spielberg could have accomplished,
but did not.  Unfortunately, moments such as these were far and few between
in SPR, whereas in "Apocalypse Now" for instance, almost every frame, every
sound, every element actually, seems carefully (and lovingly) thought out. 
It was thus sad to witness, that each time SPR began to approach "art," it
quickly became just more Hollywood "entertainment."  Given the subject
matter, and the supposed "tribute" Spielberg seemed to desperately want to
convey, the film clearly betrays its own values. I suspect that the possibly
faulty "values" of the director himself, are the sole blame for this, but his
politics being what they obviously are, I won't "go there."</P>
<P>Another SPR positive however, and a whole sequence which for me, seemed as if
it almost belonged in another movie (a great one?), was that of the whole
"radar installation" attack scene, which lasted about 15 minutes.  This
singular part of the film was absolute brilliance.  It started with Hanks'
men questioning whether they should attack this area, or just go around it. 
For the first time in the film, I felt as if I were actually watching real
people, and not just actors.  Before this point (and sadly, after the
sequence was over), I again felt as if I were just watching a cast playing
parts.        This was especially evident in the earlier walking/chatting part,
where we are "introduced" to the various characters (I guess that was
Spielberg's intention).  This was pure corn, out of a dozen other WWII films,
and I didn't buy it for a moment.  Wasn't there some other way for the
filmmaker to make us more familiar with the characters than something so
consummately unimaginative?</P>
<P>The truly outstanding radar attack sequence, when compared to much of the
rest of the movie, seemed to strangely stand out for me, so much so that I
almost wonder if someone else directed this part.  The characters were given
a REAL identity to me during this portion.  And for all the talk (hype?) of
blood and gore and entrails in SPR, to me, the only really powerful depiction
of the horror, came in this one section of the film, specifically in the
segment when one of the GI's chests was pumping gushes of bright red blood. 
Before dying, where he meekly mouthed the words "Mama, mama" in a haze of
morphine shots, Spielberg leaves all the million dollar effects and stages
and sets behind, relying on something the rest of the film seems not to want
to delve too deeply in, namely, real death.  For all the blood and carnage
SPR shows throughout, little of it ever really made an impression on this
viewer.  It was mostly just typical "Hollywood" war movie nonsense, rows of
German soldiers being mowed down by one single American, men getting shot and
falling over, dead immediately, and lots of bandaged wounded, exhibiting very
little actual pain or suffering.  When the lone GI died in the arms of his
fellow comrades, SPR clearly for me succeeded in what it seemed to want to do
from the start, powerfully and emotionally display the actual results of all
of this flying hot metal and debris, which real combat is.</P>
<P>Why wasn't there so much more of this however?        When the little French girl
is handed down to a GI amidst a hail of German sniper fire, I fully expected
to see the girl's head blown off, or at least something truly horrible
happen.  Earlier in the film, in the much hyped opening 20-25 minute
sequence, there is a long beach shot of the bloody aftermath of the landing,
showing waves of blood, dead men, and dead fish.  Good enough.        But weren't
some of those poor souls still alive?  Why not show their utterly horrible
pain and suffering?  When one of the men gets his arm blown off and goes to
retrieve it in a nightmarish way, I wanted Spielberg to show us this man a
bit later on, to show us the real consequences of what had happened. 
Typically however in SPR, Spielberg "chickens out" in doing such things, and
in doing so, for whatever reason, he continually disappoints.  For myself,
the only "bloody" scene in the entire movie which had any kind of real
effect, was the dying man whose seemingly stray fire wounds, resulted in an
unstoppable sea of red gore, the life force itself, draining from his body. 
In essence, there was really nothing else in the film, despite the high tech
and obvious on-screen high budget, which stayed true to the film's own
purported intention to actually show the real horror of war, as this one
solitary scene did.</P>
<P>There was more to the horror of these events however, than simple blood and
gore.  SPR seems a bit more successful in displaying such, although again, it
seems to undercut itself whenever possible.  One particularly great little
fragment of the movie when it did not, was again, in this specific section of
the film.  Following their friend's slow and bloody death, Hanks goes over by
himself, and he is shaking, crying, trying to hold back the emotion of what
he's just witnessed.  There is subtle music this time.        There is also a
lingering effect to the camerawork, a slow zoom.  Spielberg lets the actor
ACT here, and even though it was Tom Hanks, my suspension was complete. 
Here, like the earlier scene where we experience up close and personal
someone's bloody death, the true nature of war was brought home to me, more
powerfully than any series of high-priced Hollywood FX.</P>
<P>After Hanks cries, the entire Axis prisoner scene, was also good.  There was
a real tension here, and I easily felt myself not watching a movie anymore,
but feeling as if I had some sort of personal stake in what I was watching. 
In SPR, Spielberg's more delicate and subtly discriminating touches, were
clearly the best moments of the film.  All the blood and violence and special
effects of the opening and closing sections, never came close for me, to
displaying the real horror of war, than this one little middle section, which
culminated in two men on the same side, almost killing each other because a
POW was being released. In this one short sequence, to me, the film not only
gave me a sense of the real horror of war, but it also had a real moral
center and soul.  The subtle nature of Spielberg's touch here was also the
real power of the effect.  This was to be lost afterwards however, and
especially near the end of the film.  If, and I emphasize that word, any real
tribute to basic humanity and the values and ideals which made "our" side the
"good" side in WWII, was present in SPR, it was only present in this one
section, seen through the eyes of the translator, and eventually Hanks.  This
whole concept was utterly blown to bits at the end of the film however, and
throughout other sections was given only lip service at best.  Had SPR truly
explored such ideas however, I guess that would've cut into the special
effects and explosions, and we couldn't have that now, could we?</P>
<P>Overall, SPR's standard MOP seems to be cliché exaggeration and more.  There
are few real surprises in this film.  For all the unique things in it, there
is little very original or thought provoking, and time after time, Spielberg
just does not seem willing to take chances.  A lot of SPR actually feels more
like your standard, formula episode of television's WWII series from 60's,
"Combat." That series in fact, which used to be a favorite of mine, kept
entering my head throughout SPR.  The men walking in the field chatting and
wisecracking, the quiet whispering in the church at night, the whole French
girl/sniper/dying soldier in the middle of the road scene, and most of the
last half hour at the bridge, seemed regulation Vic Morrow material to me. 
In SPR, about the only added element to this 2 and ½ hour episode of "Combat"
was clearly money spent on sets and effects.</P>
<P>So many archetypal scenes like this, I felt, were simply missed by Spielberg,
that is, their POTENTIAL to be presented in a truly original, superlative,
and powerful manner, was missed.  Even the opening landing sequence, which
has been commented on by many as so "gory," came nothing close to what I
expected (and hoped for).  One of my chief complaints about ALL war movies,
let alone WWII ones, is that none have very effectively portrayed (for me)
what combat must really be like.  SPR did so in some respects, better than
most.  But some of the images were laughable to me.  The singular shot of the
guy laying there screaming, with half of his guts hanging out on the sand,
was something out of a cheap horror movie.  It wasn't believable at all.  The
shot of the man trying to retrieve his shot-off arm, was also not effective. 
Many of the so-called "gore" shots, seemed simple FX to me, and nothing of
their real import or pain was portrayed effectively by Spielberg.  WAY TOO
MANY shots for me of Americans mowing down whole groups of German soldiers,
like as if this was a standard scene out of WWII (it wasn't).  It IS a
standard, stereotypical scene out of WWII MOVIES however.  I had hoped for
much more however, in SPR.  Guys riding up onto tanks and armored cars
throwing in hand grenades, more rows of Germans mowed down by a single man,
Generals quoting Abraham Lincoln with schmaltzy music swelling, the wiseguy
from Brooklyn, the tough sergeant, the scene where the WRONG Private Ryan was
notified of his brother's deaths were all predictable, boring, and totally
cliché to me.  All of these things were plain old stock WWII movie nonsense. 
This might've worked 20 years ago.  I expect more today.  If a man gets his
arm blown away, I want to "feel his pain" for a few moments, before moving on
to the next FX shot.  If German tanks were as formidable and frightening as
those who fought them have testified, why was taking them out so "easy?" 
Hollywood, that's why.        I saw only ONE shot near the end, where they fire a
mortar or bazooka at a Tiger, when the shell only bounced off harmlessly. 
Otherwise, in Spielberg's fantasy WWII world, whole German squads can easily
be mowed down by a single GI, and tanks and other weapons can be disabled
with nothing more than some good old GI Joe bravery.  For all the effects,
for all the blood and guts that ARE shown, SPR continually refuses to step
over certain lines.  It wants to be two things at once, which is its ultimate
undoing, to show the "reality" of war, but to do it in an entertaining
Hollywood story suited for mass consumption.  Whenever Spielberg gets close
to one side of it, the reality side, he once again becomes the Hollywood
entertainer.  It's as if he were trying to put menacing sharks or dinosaurs
in the middle of "Schindler's List." SPR felt that way generally to me
throughout. A schizophrenic movie, no doubt about it.</P>
<P>Three parts of the film (though there are others) were particularly annoying
in this manner.  When the decision to hold the bridge is made, and Hanks
comes up with the sock bomb/sniper in the tower/middle of the road lure/plan,
the men begin putting this into action.  So what do we get?  Not a sense of
the real desperateness of their plight or their fears, but more over the top
music, quick cuts and shots of the preparation (right out of Jaws), and more
MOVIE MOVIE stuff.  Then a much too long, extended "lull" sequence as the
troops await the German's attack, which SHOULD depict some sense of impending
doom and death, but which concentrates more on triviality.  I simply didn't
buy it.  And by the way, was Hanks so out of touch and unable to reach his
superiors at this time, that he would not/could not try to find out what THEY
wanted him to do when Ryan refused to go back?        What was it that completely
turned Hank's character and motivation at this time, from getting the mission
accomplished, to playing hero? This was bad writing to me, or just
unrealistic movie heroics.  In real life, I don't think this would've played
out at all like it did in the film.  Again, cliché, audience manipulation,
and Hollywood crapola.</P>
<P>Who can take the death and final heroics of Hanks vainly shooting his pistol
(Hanks, the sudden "hero"?) at the Tiger seriously, when at the very last
moment, the "Calvary" arrives and the tank is blown away by a plane?  All is
right with the world.  Happy ending.  Nonsense.  I laughed out loud when the
plane arrived to blow the tank away.  I couldn't believe how corny and
predictable this was, and still can't believe Spielberg utilized this
hackneyed concept at all, let alone in such a crucial part of the film. 
Wasn't this scene a direct copy of the one in "Jurassic Park" where the
people are just about to be eaten by the two vicious Raptors only to be
"saved" at the last moment by the T-Rex?  Corn…unoriginal corn.  Hank's death
after this, was also totally unmoving to me, and was also completely
predictable at this point.  His death seemed quite contrived, and like so
many other parts of SPR, quite expected.  I fully expected Hanks to die from
about mid-point in the film, exactly as he did. I even guessed at what he
would say to Ryan in his dying breath.</P>
<P>However, what WAS NOT expected (for me at least), and what eventually made me
throw up my hands with the film as a whole, was when the meek translator, who
had acted so afraid and cowardly up until this time, calmly shoots the
earlier released POW who had been part of the last battle sequence.  This was
the same man which the translator had befriended, the same human being which
he pleaded with Hank's to spare over "moral" issues, and here, near the end
of the film, Spielberg has the ONLY true moral character in the film (the
American translator) calmly murder the smiling, hands-raised, unarmed
prisoner.  This was done so casually, and obviously shown intentionally that
way by Spielberg, that ANY sort of patriotic feelings I myself held at this
point, were totally wiped out.        Why did this man shoot the prisoner? 
Spielberg seems to be trying to make some point here, some "subtle" one at
best, that such horrible insanity all around has even turned the meek but
moral coward into just another part of the vicious madness, and yet, any such
"point" is totally negated by yet another "cheat."  We are never really given
any reason for this behavior, are not shown any consequences of it, and it
totally contradicts the whole concept of the film itself.  Throughout SPR, we
are constantly bombarded with this idea that all of this horror and violence
is real and appalling.        And yet, at the end, when the translator murders the
unarmed POW, I was left to wonder what was the point of ANY single
"patriotic" element in the film?  How anyone could proudly show an American
flag flowing in the wind AFTER this, and really expect any decent human being
to feel the slightest sympathy with the filmmaker's own biased
(nationalistic) viewpoint, is beyond me.  Could it be that the very immoral
and materialistic "soul" of SPR, clearly revealed to myself at least, is only
a reflection of what's lacking in the "soul" of its creator?  I have no other
interpretation at this time, and would have to say yes.  As a whole, SPR
fails for me as anything but entertainment.  To read into the film anything
"deeper" than that, feels as disingenuous to me as reading same in most of
Spielberg's other works.</P>
<P>Summing up, I walked out of this film hardly thinking afterwards of it,
except for dwelling on my disgust for the wasted effort and money.  Like so
much of Spielberg's other "enjoyable" work (Jurassic Park, ET, and the Raider
sequels), it is digestible filler candy for awhile, but there are no great
ideas here, no true moral or political or philosophical "center" or soul.  I
have not found myself thinking much about anything in this film subsequently,
except for the few brief positive moments mentioned above.  I think only the
easily manipulated, or those who were there back then and find some common
experiences depicted, think this is truly a "great" film.  It is not.  It is
average.  And to me, in many ways, it contradicts its whole subject in the
first place.  Maybe Hollywood WILL "get it right" someday, but SPR didn't. 
As a film about WWII, it is an above average one, but it comes nowhere near
others, such as "Bridge on the River Kwai," "The Great Escape," "Stalag 17,"
"A Midnight Clear," and is even inferior to the last "blockbuster" made about
this event, "The Longest Day."        Hell, at least THAT one was up front about
its jingoistic, sloppy sentimentality.        SPR dwells in a similar sensibility,
but denies doing it to its audience every step of the way.  In this day and
age, and considering what Spielberg had to work with, what the film clearly
does wrong, cannot in the final analysis, overcome the few things it does
right.        Entertaining?  Yes. Transcendent?  Only if one is easily prone to
hype, whether political, or cinematic.        This viewer is neither.</P>
