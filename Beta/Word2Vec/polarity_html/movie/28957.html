<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>The Gift is a supernatural thriller whose motto is: 'always follow your
instincts.' I listened as the psychic said that was how she was taught to
believe what she sees by her kindly grandmother and by taking that advice I was
able to instantly guess who the murderer was, while the film's psychic had
lapses of memory and forgot from time to time that handy motto. Unfortunately
because of that glitch in the story and the film's gapping holes in logic, I
wasn't absorbed by this moody and atmospheric thriller as much as I should have
been. When you see how the film will be resolved before the main character does
and that person is playing a psychic, then there is something amiss about the
story. The suspense always felt tacked on to all the psychic visions that
dramatically kept the pot boiling. This ploy always felt contrived and the film
never quite felt real. </P>
<P>It takes place in a nasty Southern small-town (it was filmed in Savannah, Ga.);
and, it involves a saintly widow, supporting three small boys because her
husband got killed in a factory explosion accident last year, who gets involved
in a murder mystery. Cate Blanchett gives a haunting performance as the psychic
Annie Wilson, someone who is both vulnerable and strong in character. The film
opens as she is shown reading her special cards to her clients and helping the
troubled in her community by offering them sound advice. Her girlfriend Linda
(Dickens) wants to know what kind of man is in her future; Valerie Barksdale
(Swank) is an abused woman who is afraid to confront her redneck husband Donnie
(Reeves) about the regular beatings he administers and is advised by Annie to
leave him; and, in town she runs into a mentally disturbed and violent young
garage mechanic, with a death wish, Buddy Cole (Ribisi), who is all bottled up
about his relationship with his father and she tries to get him to face those
bitter childhood memories. Ribisi's portrayal was hammy and particularly
uninteresting. </P>
<P>The first half of the film builds up a case against what a wretched monster this
Donnie is, how he calls Annie a satanic witch and threatens her and the children
if she meddles in his marriage; he even violates her household by sneaking in to
use her cards to spell out satan on her bed. The mystery event occurs when an
attractive but promiscuous young woman from a prominent family, Jessica King
(Holmes), who is engaged to the clean-cut school principal, Wayne Collins
(Kinnear), turns up missing. Sheriff Johnson (Simmons) is not a believer in
psychics, nevertheless is forced to call on Annie at Mr. King's insistence.
Annie dreams that Jessica is dead in a pond, and when the sheriff's men dredge
Donnie's pond they find her body there and arrest him. </P>
<P>When the case goes to trial Annie is surprised at who the district attorney
(Cole) is, because he was seen the night before the murder by her making love to
Jessica in the ladies' room of the rich social club she was visiting with her
friend Linda. The trial was poorly filmed and made a mockery of how a trial
should be run. Everything about it seemed unbelievable, as there was one scene
where Annie is ridiculously attacked by the defense lawyer (Jeter) on a personal
basis while the district attorney doesn't even object. </P>
<P>This whodunit had many contrivances and they all sapped strength from the film's
already rather weak mystery story. The two things that kept this film watchable
were the suspenseful visuals of Annie's dark visions -- eerily recalling things
from the dead world, and Cate's gifted performance, that brought more to the
story than the script by Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson could provide. This
is a return for Mr. Raimi ("The Evil Dead") to his B-film origins, but this time
with a Hollywood budget. As a Hollywood film it fails to deliver enough punch to
be a box-office hit, but as a B-film it seems easier to overlook the film's lack
of punch to its story and accept its ordinary Gothic story as possibly having
more to it than presented. </P>
