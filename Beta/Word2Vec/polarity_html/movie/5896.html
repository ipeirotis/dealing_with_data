<P>     There is nothing that will make a Hollywood marketing executive
salivate like a current news story to which a new film can be linked, and
if you remember the bounce THE CHINA SYNDROME got from the Three Mile
Island accident of 1979, you'll understand why.  When a seven-state power
failure hit the American west on August 10th, the folks at Gramercy must
have done the Mipos Dance of Joy -- five days later, I had press material
for the blackout thriller THE TRIGGER EFFECT mentioning the August 10th
failure.  It's hard to resist that kind of "torn-from-today's-headlines"
marketing, but I hope they don't make THE TRIGGER EFFECT look like a cheap
knock-off by overdoing it, because it is nothing of the kind.  This is a
sharp and surprisingly effective thriller which makes up for a sluggish
middle with an exceptional start and finish.</P>
<P>     It is Friday in an unnamed California city, and a young married
couple named Matt (Kyle MacLachlan) and Annie (Elisabeth Shue) are
enjoying a night at the movies despite some talkative fellow audience
members.  The problems really begin when they get home.  Their infant
daughter has an ear infection, their housing contractors appear to be
committing petty thefts, and to make matters worse, the power goes out.
The first night, it's an inconvenience; the next day, it becomes
dangerous.  Along with the power, phones and radio stations are also out,
causing rumors to run rampant, and stores -- those which remain open --
can only take cash.  Along with their friend Joe (Dermot Mulroney), Matt
and Annie try to wait out the blackout, but find themselves forced to act
as the threads of civilization begin to unravel around them.</P>
<P>     THE TRIGGER EFFECT opens with one of the niftiest single-take scenes
of the year, following a chain of events in a mall which eventually
introduces us to Matt and Annie.  Beginning with a man on the receiving
end of a spilled cup of coffee, rookie director David Koepp (screenwriter
for JURASSIC PARK, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE and others) shows people acting
shocked at the rudeness of others, then proceeding to treat someone else
just as rudely.  It is a smart and subtle piece of film-making which
underlines the main premise of THE TRIGGER EFFECT:  how fragile a
foundation it is on which civilization is based.  It is amazing how much
more obvious the ineptitude of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU becomes when
compared to a film which takes a very similar theme -- what separates us
from animals -- and does it so much better.</P>
<P>     It's a great concept for an information age thriller, with both a nod
to and an updating of the classic "Twilight Zone" episode "The Monsters
are Due on Maple Street," but Koepp loses track of his story for a while
to focus on relationship troubles between Matt and Annie.  He tries to
connect those troubles to the film's central themes -- Annie has a problem
respecting the mild-mannered Matt until he steals medicine for the baby --
and he is successful for a little while.  Elisabeth Shue does smart work
as a sexy mother and wife with a bit of a wild streak, and Kyle MacLachlan
is a solid hero as the relentlessly civil Matt, but they are distracted
along with Koepp by the introduction of Mulroney and a romantic triangle.
Whatever point Koepp might have been trying to make about the attraction
of "animal behavior" gets muddled in the house-bound middle third of THE
TRIGGER EFFECT.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, Koepp pulls it all together for a nerve-wracking
conclusion as Matt, Annie and Joe hit the road in an attempt to get out of
town.  Just two days removed from a normal life, the world around them
dissolves into paranoia and a relentless pursuit of survival, and a climax
featuring two superb showdowns:  one involving an edgy stranger (Bill
Simitrovich) who claims to want nothing more than a ride, the other
involving Matt's attempt to break into a house to steal car keys.  Koepp
is not a genius at creating shaded characters (remember, he _did_ write
JURASSIC PARK and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE), but he demonstrates an impressive
talent for building tension and for pacing a thriller to keep his audience
involved.  It is also noteworthy that Koepp never makes a point of
explaining what caused the blackout, because that would have been sending
the wrong message about what mattered about this story.  THE TRIGGER
EFFECT is a disturbing and all-too-real tale which makes the ironic
observation that we have come to depend on technology for our humanity,
and if a little creative marketing will bring people out to see it, then
so be it.</P>
