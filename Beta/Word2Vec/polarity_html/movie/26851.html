<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An astute political film about an idealistic liberal lawyer concerned
with community grass roots issues. Bill McKay (Robert Redford) is the
son of the former legendary political machine-sponsored governor of
California John J. McKay (Melvyn Douglas). Redford is talked into
running for California senator against an incumbent Republican
Reagan-like conservative, Crocker Jarmon (Don Porter). The film is so
realistic, probably, because it was written by a Senator Eugene McCarthy
speechwriter Jeremy Larner, who won the Oscar for his original
screenplay. It is directed by Michael Ritchie (Downhill Racer), who does
a good job keeping the film afloat with black humor and tension. It
thankfully never sinks into melodrama because it stays with the campaign
without padding on an unnecessary plot.</P>
<P>The only difficulty I had with the film, is that it is not easy to
parody the political scene, which is already a parody of itself. But
what the film successfully brings to the table, is it clearly shows how
a candidate might start out sincere, hoping that the power of the job
would allow him to do the things he wants to do to make things better in
society, yet the candidate thinks he must compromise and play the
political game in order to get elected. This intelligent film shows that
better than any other political film I have seen thus far: it magnifies
what the seduction of power can do to someone, even an idealist like the
Redford character. The candidate, though, compromised, still remains a
somewhat ambiguous sympathetic figure, someone who still might be
effective as a senator, even though he is flawed.</P>
<P>The film opens, as there seems to be little hope for the Democrats to
win in the senate race in California against an excellent campaigner and
a veteran silver-tongued politician Senator Jarmon. Therefore, Democrat
campaign manager, Marvin Lucas (Boyle), decides to take a chance and get
a fresh face with blue blood political credentials to run for office,
the handsome and articulate Bill McKay. He gets Democrat media
consultant Howard Klein (Garfield) to run the TV and ad campaign, who is
one of those loud-mouth, opinionated, irksome individuals, who always
has to be busy doing something. When he is at his desk, he pounds his
hammer on some walnuts while conducting business. McKay is a do-gooder,
working out of a makeshift lawyer's office defending environmental and
local community issues, and is not interested at first in the senate
office. But Lucas pushes the right buttons, tells him he can say what he
wants to and go where he wants to go, but by securing this powerful
office he can be more influential in getting his political agenda
across. In his understated salespitch to Redford, Lucas writes on the
cover of the matchbook that he hands him: You lose. Which supposedly
means, for the moment, what do you have to lose, just be yourself, no
one expects you to win. Nancy (Carlson), the candidate's attractive
wife, also, applies pressure on him as she encourages him to run, seeing
herself in a more important light as the wife of a senator. Later, the
matchbook message will mean that he lost his soul, as Redford tries to
be humorous in a droll way and says the message means the results are of
the early returns.</P>
<P>Behind in the polls by 14 points, his campaign is preaching to the choir
until he is told by Lucas that he must now reach out to other voters, or
else he will lose in a landslide. The change in McKay's message is not
without misgivings on his part, but what the film does well is keep the
focus on the campaign. Soon, his ratings go up in the polls while
drawing women voters to him because of his virile looks. He also
energizes the apathetic electorate with basically the same tired
political rhetoric his opponent is saying, but he has charisma and it
somehow sounds fresh coming from his lips. During the TV debate, Redford
transposes his face on Jarmon's, and there is no distinction between the
two of them, except he still suffers from the conflicts of his
conscience and still thinks he can overcome the political scenario and
do good on his promises. But this is shown as being rather dubious, as
his father's old political ally, the labor leader Starkey (Tobey)
promises to deliver the vote for him, with the tacit understanding of
the favors he expects if his candidate should become senator.</P>
<P>When Redford wins in an upset but is perceived as having sold out for
the victory, talking in meaningless soundbites to appeal to the masses,
... his appreciative father comes up to him and offers him the
left-handed compliment, "Son, you're a politician." To further sink in
what has happened to him amidst the hysteria of the victory celebration
of the party faithful, he asks Lucas with a confused expression on his
kisser, "What do we do now...?"</P>
<P>In "The Candidate," the Redford character has no one to blame but
himself for his decisions. He was the one who sold himself out. It would
be too easy to blame it on the system, which this film correctly doesn't
do. This Hollywood film has passed the test of time and is still a good
watch, especially, during an election year. And, even though the times
have changed from the 1970s, the political process still looks the same,
if that is possible to believe.</P>
