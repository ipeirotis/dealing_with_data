<P>     In late 1978, a small horror film opened in Bowling Green, Kentucky 
(before moving on to Chicago and New York City) that would change the 
face of the genre.  Initially dismissed by many serious critics as 
unworthy of attention or praise, the motion picture looked headed for an 
oblivion where it would never make back its small, $300,000 budget.  
Then, months later, Tom Allen's insightful and complimentary essay 
appeared in THE VILLAGE VOICE.  Suddenly, critics began to notice that 
there was more to this film than initially met the eye.</P>
<P>     Because of its title, HALLOWEEN has frequently been grouped 
together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters 
throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s.  However, while HALLOWEEN is 
rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre, it is not 
a member (the HALLOWEEN sequels, on the other hand, are).  This is not a 
gruesome motion picture -- there is surprisingly little graphic violence 
and almost no blood.  HALLOWEEN is built on suspense, not gore, and 
initiated more than a few of today's common horror/thriller cliches.  
The ultimate success of the movie, however, encouraged other film makers 
to try their hand at this sort of enterprise, and it didn't take long 
for someone to decide that audiences wanted as many explicitly grisly 
scenes as the running length would allow.  By the time HALLOWEEN's 
sequel was released in 1981, the objective of this sort of movie was no 
longer to scare its viewers, but to gross them out.</P>
<P>     From a shock-and-suspense point-of-view, HALLOWEEN is the rival of 
Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO.  With only a few arguable exceptions (such as 
THE EXORCIST), there isn't another post-1970 release that comes close to 
it in terms of scaring the living hell out of a viewer.  HALLOWEEN 
starts out in a creepy fashion with a brutal murder, and never lets up 
from there.  Every frame drips with atmosphere.  Who cares that it was 
filmed during the spring in California instead of during the autumn in 
fictional Haddonfield, Illinois?</P>
<P>     HALLOWEEN was the film that earned Jamie Lee Curtis the infamous 
title of "Scream Queen."  She plays Laurie Strode, the virginal 
protagonist.  Curtis' capable interpretation of the gawky, awkward 
Laurie is frequently overlooked in analyses of the movie and its genre, 
but she effectively conveys the feelings and aspirations of a shy, 
insecure teenager.  It's hard to believe that the actress would develop 
(in more ways than one) into a woman whose sexual appeal would drive 
pictures like A FISH CALLED WANDA.</P>
<P>     The film opens with a long, single-shot prologue that takes place 
on Halloween night, 1963.  A young Michael Myers watches as his older 
sister, Judith, sneaks upstairs for a quickie with a guy from school.  
After the boyfriend has departed, Michael takes a knife out of the 
kitchen drawer, ascends the staircase, and stabs Judith to death.  The 
entire sequence employs the subjective point-of-view, an approach that 
writer/director John Carpenter returns to repeatedly throughout the 
movie.  Only after the deed is done do we learn that Michael is only a 
grade-schooler.</P>
<P>     The bulk of the movie takes place fifteen years later.  Michael, 
confined to an asylum for the criminally insane for more than ten years, 
escapes on the night before Halloween.  His doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald 
Pleasance), believing Michael to be the embodiment of evil, tracks the 
killer back to his hometown of Haddonfield.  From there, it's a race 
against time as Loomis seeks to locate and stop Michael before he starts 
again where he left off in 1963. </P>
<P>     Michael's primary victims are Laurie and her two best friends, 
Annie (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda (P.J. Soles).  Throughout the film, 
Michael is shown gradually closing in on the girls, until, in the final 
act, Laurie is involved in a face-to-face fight for her life.  Much has 
been made of the fact that the key to survival in HALLOWEEN is being a 
virgin.  The three girls who have sex with their boyfriends (Judith 
Myers, Annie, and Lynda) don't survive their encounters with Michael.  
Laurie, who has nothing to do with boys, does.  Co-writers Carpenter and 
Debra Hill have stated numerous times that this was not a conscious 
theme, but, ever since HALLOWEEN, the standard for slasher films has 
been that sexual promiscuity leads to a violent end.</P>
<P>     Nick Castle plays Michael (who is referred to in the end credits as 
"the shape") as an implacable, inhuman adversary.  Because he wears a 
painted white Captain Kirk mask, we only once (briefly) see his 
features, and this makes him all the more frightening.  He kills without 
making a sound or changing his expression, and his movements are often 
slow and zombie-like.  Carpenter is exceedingly careful in chosing the 
camera angles he uses to shoot Michael.  Before the climax, there's 
never a clear close-up -- he's always concealed by shadows, shown in the 
distance, or presented as otherwise obscured.  This approach makes for 
an especially ominous villain.  Subsequent HALLOWEENs delved more deeply 
into Michael's origins and his connection to Laurie, but, in this one, 
he remains an enigma, and the lack of a clear motive makes his actions 
all the more terrifying.  </P>
<P>     Another important element of HALLOWEEN's success is our ability to 
identify with the trio of female protagonists, and Carpenter establishes 
a rapport between the audience and the characters by employing 
intelligent, realistic dialogue and placing the girls in believable 
situations.  For Annie and Lynda, the most important thing about 
Halloween night is finding a place to have sex with their boyfriends.  
For Laurie, it's making sure the kid she's babysitting is having a good 
time.  Annie and Lynda are blissfully unaware of their danger until it's 
too late, but Laurie recognizes her peril.  Meanwhile, if Michael 
represents pure evil, Sam Loomis is the avenging angel.  He's the voice 
of reason that no one listens to, and, in the end, he's the cavalry 
coming over the mountain, gun blazing. </P>
<P>     HALLOWEEN is one of those films where the attention to detail is 
evident in every frame.  While there are many memorable moments, three 
scenes stand out above the rest.  The first is the long, unbroken 
opening sequence where the young Michael dons a clown mask and murders 
his sister.  Often copied, but never equaled, this scene was unique for 
its time and reminiscent of PSYCHO's shower murder for its effect.  The 
second also occurs early in the movie, as Michael escapes from the 
asylum during a rain storm.  To this day, I find these to be the most 
chilling three minutes of the movie.  Finally, there's the scene near 
the end where Laurie is banging on a locked door while Michael 
approaches slowly and inexorably from behind.  It's a credit to 
Carpenter that, no matter how many times you've seen the movie, the 
tension at this point still mounts to a palpable level.</P>
<P>     Despite being relatively simple and unsophisticated, HALLOWEEN's 
music is one of its strongest assets.  Carpenter's dissonant, jarring 
themes provide the perfect backdrop for Michael's activity, proving that 
a film doesn't need a symphonic score by an A-line composer to be 
effective.  Carpenter's HALLOWEEN main title, one of the horror genre's 
best-recognizable tunes, can bring chills even away from the theater.  
Try putting it in the tape deck when you're alone in the car sometime 
after midnight on a lonely country road, and see if you feel secure.</P>
<P>     The final body count in HALLOWEEN is surprisingly low (the 
immediate sequel, HALLOWEEN 2, rectified this matter, but that's another 
story), but the terror quotient is high.  This is the kind of impeccably 
crafted motion picture that burrows deep into our psyche and connects 
with the dark, hidden terrors that lurk there.  HALLOWEEN is not a 
perfect movie, but no recent horror film has attained this pinnacle (as 
evidenced by the plaudits heaped upon it in Wes Craven's recent SCREAM).  
Likewise, John Carpenter has never come close to recapturing HALLOWEEN's 
artistic or commercial success, though he has tried many times.  
HALLOWEEN remains untouched -- a modern classic of the most horrific 
kind.</P>
