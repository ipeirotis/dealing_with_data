<PRE>THE LOVERS OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>In THE LOVERS OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE, a stunning picture with a plethora
of magical images, the paper airplane scene is among the most memorable.
8-year-old Otto (Peru Medem) goes to the school bathroom and lets fly a
squadron of paper airplanes in hopes that one of them will reach his
newfound girlfriend, Ana (Sara Valiente).  Ana attends a school
separated from his by only a high wrought iron fence.  On each plane he
has written the same question about love, one so profound that those
finding the planes assume that an adult must have written it.  We watch
their flight as they glide effortlessly through the air.  We see the
only one that makes it to her courtyard perfectly framed by a circle in
the iron gate.  After she reads its inscription, her life is forever
transformed.</P>
<P>Thus starts a hauntingly beautiful love story that spans a lifetime.
Ana, whose dad has recently died in car accident, initially sees him
coming back in the body of Otto.  Otto has just had his own tragedy
since his parents have just separated.</P>
<P>Written and directed by Julio Medem, the movie is easily one of the most
poetic movies in some time.  The images captured by cinematographer
Gonzalo Berridi are as breathtaking in the intimate moments as in the
grand.  One time-lapsed sequence filmed over a lake in Lapland during
the time of the midnight sun will take your breath away.</P>
<P>Otto and Ana feel bound by many things, including the way both of their
names form palindromes.  They have a complicated life since Ana's mom
and Otto's dad, soon fall in love and end up living together.  Otto, who
stays with his mom, doesn't like Ana to be called his sister, and Ana
feels likewise.  They just stare at each other for years with such deep
intensity that it is misconstrued as dislike by their parents.</P>
<P>Finally, as older teenagers, Otto (Víctor Hugo Oliveira) and Ana
(Kristel Díaz) began to consummate their dormant relationship.  The
scene in which the wall between them finally breaks is just as
astonishing as the aforementioned airplane scene.  Using the aphorism
that silence is golden, the director stages their first liaison more
with subtle images than words.  As he looks on his sleeping love, Otto
remains speechless and frozen.  The wind rustles loudly in the trees,
and lights and shadows dance on his face.  This is the sort of
reverential look at sexuality rarely found in American films, especially
those dealing with teens.</P>
<P>After more tragedies and complications, the film jumps forward again to
the now grown Otto (Fele Martínez) and Ana (Najwa Nimri), neither of
whose life has gone as expected.  What hasn't changed is that deep down
their love for each other is eternal.</P>
<P>Ana describes her life as a "chain of coincidences."  The story explores
this circularity of life with some strategically placed movements
forward and backward in time to illustrate the ties our past have with
our present.  The story is organized into many chapters, usually named
either Otto or Ana.  In each of these chapters we learn the story from a
different perspective.  The delicate beauty of the narrative is enhanced
by the way the filmmaker doesn't feel the need to explain everything and
leaves some key scenes purposely ambiguous.</P>
<P>In a film that is so much more than just the sum of its parts, its parts
are pretty impressive in themselves.  The casting and the acting,
especially tricky with a story that spans three sets of ages, are
wonderful.  Alberto Iglesias's music has a haunting lyricism.  And the
dialog possesses a simple beauty.  "I felt that something known had
moved into the unknown," is how Ana describes one of her revelations.</P>
<P>The mesmerizing film so transfixes the audience that you feel you are
engulfed in the picture.  It is more than a mere movie and becomes
almost a spiritual experience.  Bursting with memorable images, the
movie's strength can be witnessed in the perfect ways the transitions
between scenes are handled.  One image in flames cuts to the coolness of
Otto and Ana sledding down a mountain.  And as in the rest of this
carefully constructed film of delicate intricacy, these two scenes have
many links, only some of which are immediately apparent.  A film for the
mind as well as the heart, THE LOVERS OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE has only one
significant fault.  It ends.</P>
<P>THE LOVERS OF THE ARCTIC CIRCLE runs 1:52.  The film's sparse dialog is
in Spanish with English subtitles.  It is rated R for brief nudity,
sexuality and mature themes and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
