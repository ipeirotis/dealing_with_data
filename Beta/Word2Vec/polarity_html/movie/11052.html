<P>CONTACT is the 1997 movie I've seen the most - five times to be exact. Four of
those times were on the big screen, but even on a TV, it's a very impressive
film. The same can't be said for films like INDEPENDANCE DAY, but that's
because CONTACT is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is
treated more importantly than the special effects, and all of us know looking
back that ID4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy.</P>
<P>CONTACT's wonderfully presented story deals with Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster),
a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique
of "merely listening" to sounds out in space. Her interest in the field of
astronomy developed at a very young age, encouraged by her loving father, Ted
(David Morse), who let Ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies
and communicate with people as far away as Pensacola, FL (that was, of course,
before the days of Internet chat rooms). While everyone else uses modern
technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence (of
which the program SETI is an acronym for), Ellie prefers to pop on a pair of
headphones and see what she can pick up on, keeping the youthful magic and
intrigue strongly alive.</P>
<P>Ellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist, a belief
likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young.
In Puerto Rico, she meets Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), a writer
examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness; a one-
time seminary student who describes himself as "a man of the cloth, without
the cloth". Despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a "supreme
being", Ellie and Palmer hit it off, and even take the time to sleep together.
It's a weak and hurried relationship, but director Zemeckis needs it to add to
the plot later on. Meanwhile, Dr. David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt), who has
authority over SETI but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money,
is ready to pull the plug on any and all SETI funding. This leaves the
passionate Ellie searching for new sponsors, eventually finding a setup in New
Mexico and leaving Palmer with no explanation, and only a one night stand to
remember.</P>
<P>It is in this NM city where, several months later, Ellie finally picks up on a
strong signal from outer space, perhaps the most profound discovery in the
history of science. When the signal is closely examined, many new developments
spring up, and before long, Drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation
he once scoffed at. Eventually, it is concluded that information in the signal
may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an Earthling to
Vega (where the signal seems to have originated). The media swarms, fanatics
go further off the deep end, scientists clamor for new information,
politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take, and
presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality (remember when Zemeckis
couldn't get enough of this in FORREST GUMP?). As if that weren't enough,
Ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into
Palmer.</P>
<P>CONTACT is based on the novel by Carl Sagan and deals heavily with the subject
of science vs. religion. The impressive thing is how well both aspects are
presented, with no signs of bias. Arguments for both sides are intelligent,
solid, and thought-provoking. When Palmer joins a selection committee to
choose an ambassador to Vega (of which Ellie is a leading candidate), personal
convictions play a more important role than love interests. The question is,
can a person who doesn't believe in God truly be the best representative of
Earth when 90% of the planet *does* believe in a higher power? Even when the
film wraps up, it's uncertain whether it's meant to play as an advocate for
religion, science, both, or even neither, and in our modern day society where
"right and wrong" is only opinion (at least speaking "politically correctly"),
the ambiguity is an incentive.</P>
<P>Don't get me wrong. As much as it sounds like it, CONTACT isn't merely a
theology class rolled into a reel of film. It's a *highly* enjoyable two and a
half hours. Despite its seemingly heavy issues, it's not a tedious undertaking
to watch this film. The special effects are outstanding, though (warning!)
highly depreciated on the small screen. Even so, some of the subtle visual
effects (that will likely go unnoticed by many) are even more impressive than
ones more recognizable as "sci-fi". The storytelling is rich and complete, and
although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious (and at
times, even hokey), it's easily one of the best 1997 films, and one of the
best sci-fi films I've ever seen. This is Zemeckis' best since BACK TO THE
FUTURE, and for those of us who actually know that FORREST GUMP was
astronomically overrated, Zemeckis now has real reason to boast.</P>
