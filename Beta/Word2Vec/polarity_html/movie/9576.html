<P>     A blizzard of exceptional proportions is bearing down on Colorado, 
threatening to close all routes in and out of the Rockies while burying 
the Centennial State beneath feet of snow.  Sound familiar?  Of course, 
it's a coincidence that SWITCHBACK, which uses this critical plot 
device, is opening in the wake of a mammoth late-October snow storm that 
crippled the American midwest, but it's great timing.  Paramount 
Pictures couldn't have come up with a better release date if they'd 
planned it.</P>
<P>     A baby-sitter caring for a young child is murdered, then the boy is 
kidnapped from his affluent parents' home.  A doctor-turned-drifter 
wanders through Texas, trying to hitch a ride to Salt Lake City.  An ex-
railroad worker driving around in a cadillac (with an interior decorated 
by nude pin-ups) offers him a ride.  A serial killer strikes in 
Amarillo, where the current sheriff is embroiled in a pitched battle for 
re-election against a powerful opponent.  A mysterious FBI agent arrives 
claiming to be on the killer's trail while he's really pursuing his own 
agenda.  These are the diverse strands that screenwriter Jeb Stuart 
weaves together into the tapestry of SWITCHBACK, his taut, intelligent 
directorial debut.</P>
<P>     Unlike most thrillers, SWITCHBACK doesn't move at a breakneck pace 
that camouflages flaws by ceaseless action and non-stop edge-of-the-seat 
moments.  Instead, this film progresses at a more leisurely pace, 
allowing us time to get to know each of the four main characters:  Danny 
Glover's Bob Goodall, the cadillac driver; Jared Leto's Lane Dixon, the 
wandering ex-doctor; Dennis Quaid's Frank La Cross, the FBI agent; and 
R. Lee Ermey's Sheriff Buck Olmstead.  By the time the final reel 
unspools, we've spent time with each of these men and have come to 
understand a measure of what makes them tick. </P>
<P>     That's not to say that there's no tension in SWITCHBACK.  Stuart, 
who wrote THE FUGITIVE and is helming a motion picture for the first 
time, crafts the movie in a fashion that builds tautness gradually.  As 
the snow storm intensifies and the roads become more treacherous, we 
have a sense of impending doom and death.  Ice, snow, mountainous 
heights, and racing trains all contribute to SWITCHBACK's growing sense 
of unease, which culminates in an ending that, sadly, is all-too-
routine.  But, while the finale is anticlimactic (and even a little 
silly), it's easily the weakest aspect of an otherwise well-realized 
narrative.</P>
<P>     While SWITCHBACK doesn't boast any "A-line" stars, all of the roles 
are well-cast and each of the performers does a laudable job.  Danny 
Glover (last seen floundering in GONE FISHIN'), one of Hollywood's most 
likable actors, plays the kind of helpful, cheerful character that he is 
often associated with.  Dennis Quaid (most recently looking scruffy in 
GANG RELATED) portrays Frank with a quiet intensity that betrays the 
anguish and desperation lurking just beneath his icy demeanor.  Jared 
Leto (PREFONTAINE) adds the right note of ambiguity to Lane to make us 
uncertain about his sincerity and intentions.  But, as good as these 
three are, the scene-stealer is R. Lee Ermey (PREFONTAINE), whose 
Sheriff Buck Olmstead takes over the screen as one of the year's most 
memorable supporting characters.  Ermey's performance as the moral, 
practical, cynical law man is nothing short of superb.</P>
<P>     SWITCHBACK avoids many of the staple aspects of serial killer 
movies.  First and foremost, this is not a whodunit.  While I have gone 
to great pains not to reveal the killer's identity in this review, it's 
not much of a secret.  There are enough clues littered around that it's 
possible to finger him twenty minutes into the film, and the truth is 
explicitly revealed before the halfway point.  Secondly, Stuart 
successfully avoids turning the picture into a routine chase.  In fact, 
for much of the movie, it's not clear exactly how everything is going to 
fit together in the end.  Only as the climax slowly, inexorably 
approaches does everything become clear.  Aside from the obligatory 
nature of the ending, if there's one complaint I have about SWITCHBACK, 
it's that there are times when the characters seem too smart -- but 
that's infinitely better than the alternative.</P>
<P>     Like THE GAME and KISS THE GIRLS, SWITCHBACK features an 
elaborately-structured contest between the hero and the villain.  Of 
these three movies, this one is the best, because it takes the time to 
develop its characters and doesn't force-feed us increasingly difficult-
to-swallow plot twists.  As the title implies, the storyline for 
SWITCHBACK does feature a few unexpected curves, but it doesn't try to 
dazzle us with narrative contortions.  In the end, the film is almost 
more disturbing than it is exhausting, but you'll leave the theater with 
a sense of grim satisfaction.  For SWITCHBACK, Jeb Stuart can be 
credited with a job well done.</P>
