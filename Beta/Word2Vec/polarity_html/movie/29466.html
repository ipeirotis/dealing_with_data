<PRE>"An American Rhapsody"</PRE>
<P>When the oppression of the Communist regime running 1950's Hungary proved
too much, Margit (Nastassja Kinski) and Peter (Tony Goldwyn) take their
eldest daughter and flee for the refuge of America. But, they are forced to
leave their baby, Suzanne, behind to be raised by a kind, childless couple
for six years until they can manage to bring the little girl here, too.
Longtime film editor Eva Gardos takes the helm and tells her own story
about coming to America in "An American Rhapsody."</P>
<P>Working from her own script, Gardos brings us back to a tumultuous time as
the specter of communism descends upon the people of Central Europe,
bringing to a halt the hopes of freedom that arose from the ashes of World
War II. Book publisher Peter see the writing on the wall of Stalin's
growing hegemony on his beloved Hungary and makes plans to spirit his
family out of the country. His scheme go awry when he and his wife, Margit,
are forced to leave baby Suzanne in the hands of the child's grandma, Helen
(Agnes Banfalvy). Helen is soon arrested for her complicity in the couple's
escape and Suzanne spends her formative years with Jeno (Balazs Galko) and
Teri (Zsuzsa Czinkoczi) on an idyllic farm in the country.</P>
<P>Margit, in the meantime, has not forgotten her baby and lobbies untiringly
to get her daughter back. She succeeds and, in a flurry of media attention,
six-year old Suzanne (Kelly Endresz Banlaki) arrives on American soil. But,
the little girl has only known Teri and Jeno as her parents and, while
growing close to Peter, has never embraced Margit as her mother. The
estrangement deepens when Suzanne reaches teen hood and the young girl
rebels at the overprotective hand of her birth mother. Things come to a
head when mom puts bars on her daughter's windows and an outside lock on
her door. Suzanne calls in a promise made to her years before by Peter to
go back to Hungary to the "parents" she loves. Margit, reluctantly, lets
her daughter go. Once back "home" again, the young woman comes of age and
realizes the importance and love of her real family.</P>
<P>I must laud Eva Gardos for her dedication in bringing her story to the
screen. Her effort borders on amateur at times and the overall work comes
across as something made-for-television, but there are some good things
about it, too. The best little thing in "An American Rhapsody" is the
charming performance by Kelly Endresz Banlaki as six-year-old Suzanne. The
diminutive actress comes across as a real little girl who makes the best of
being a stranger in a strange land. When, one day, she dresses in her
Hungarian clothing and sets off to play, unknown to her parents, we see
America through her innocent eyes.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the story jumps ahead to teenage Suzanne (Scarlett
Johansson), a selfish young woman who stays out all night, drinks and hangs
out with her older boyfriend, much to Margit's despair. Johansson comes
across more like a spoiled brat than a genuine young rebel. The tone of the
film takes a down turn during this transition and the impact of Suzanne's
revelations about life when she returns to Hungary is diminished. She sees
her grandmother again and all of her teen angst and rejection of her mother
is changed when she hears "the real story." It all wraps up neatly, but
without much satisfaction.</P>
<P>The end of the Cold War opened up Eastern Europe to filmmakers and Gardos
makes the best out of the lovely old city of Budapest. We get a travelogue
presentation of the bridges and buildings that make up the city, but the
nice scenery does not help the change in pace from the film's first half or
draw you close to the older Suzanne. This part keeps the viewer at arm's
length from characters and loses the involvement gained when watching the
charismatic younger Suzanne.</P>
<P>The production has an artificial feel to it as the period touches - things
like hula-hoops - are used to show the timeframes the film follows. I would
have to watch again, but it seems that the attention to such details is
less than accurate, bringing my mind to question the chronicle of events
depicted.</P>
<P>"An American Rhapsody" is a heartfelt film and an obvious labor of love by
Eva Gardos, but the story loses steam when it leaves little Suzanne's
story, becoming a conventional coming of age tale, albeit one with Budapest
as a backdrop. I give it a C.</P>
