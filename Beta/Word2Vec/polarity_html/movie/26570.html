<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A moody psychological drama about the heartaches and alienation of a
troubled Welsh man, Tyvian Jones (Stanley Baker), who can't handle his
rise from humble beginnings to his sudden fame as a writer of an
autobiography about himself as a miner, as he seeks solace in an
impossible romance. This very bitter film, a retread of  "The Blue
Angel," might appeal to fans of the great French actress Jeanne Moreau,
in one of her best performances ever, who plays Eva with a true
intensity. She is the soul of the film, making this dark and improbable
story have some teeth to bite into.</P>
<P>Joseph Losey is the American director living in England in self-exile as
a result of the McCarthy witch hunt. This b/w film is set in wintertime
Venice. It is filmed in a coldly sweeping baroque style. The jazzy
musical score is by Michel Legrand, and the great Billie Holiday song
"Weep for me," is most appropriate for the down mood the film idles on
from beginning to end. The principal characters were simply not only not
likable, lovable, or even cordial, they are personifications of a
destructive God, willing to take not only themselves down, but anyone
else who gets in their way.</P>
<P>The story itself is the film's problem, because it is so unsettling and
foolishly perverse, that it never promises any sunlight, so what is seen
in the film's first fifteen minutes is exactly what you get by the
finale, in a film that drags on for too long, coming to no point but
trying its best to bring you down with its sour look at life.</P>
<P>Ty is engaged to marry someone he doesn't love, Francesca (Virna Lisi),
a screenwriter working on the film they are making from his popular
book. She is madly in love with him, even though she realizes that he is
a scoundrel and a womanizer.</P>
<P>On the weekend of their marriage, a beautiful kept woman, Eva, and her
rich sugar daddy, get stranded in a rainstorm and seek shelter in his
house. He becomes obsessed with her, even though she plainly tells him
not to fall in love with her, that she's a whore and expects to receive
cash for her time. But he's so twisted, that he's not seeking love but
chasing something more eerie and elusive, and is so venal, that he runs
away with her to Venice, staying at its best hotel and paying for her
gambling and other whims. This drunken weekend of carnal pleasure will
cost him $30,000 and possibly the loss of his future wife.</P>
<P>While in a drunken stupor, he confesses to her that he didn't write the
book, but stole it from his dying brother, now dead, who gave him
permission to steal it and use his name on it. His brother worked all
his life as a miner, but he, worked as a miner for only six weeks. Eva
is not consoling, but is nevertheless understanding of what he did,
considering him a loser, as she gets under his skin, rejecting him and
his love. The only kind thing that can be said about the femme fatale,
is that she's upfront with him.</P>
<P>He rushes back to marry Francesca, telling her he's no good, that he
spent the weekend with a woman. She reluctantly forgives him and they
marry. On their honeymoon, after a few days of bliss, he sneaks away
from her and visits Eva in Rome. When Francesca learns of this, she
becomes so heartbroken that she commits suicide.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, he is rejected by Eva, who is seen with other men who take
care of her materially. He is so obsessed with her and humiliated by
her, that he plans to kill her, but when he sees her last, as she is
sailing to Greece with another one of her lovers, he can't kill her. He
is reduced to begging her for a chance to see her again, which she
vaguely promises she might do if she ever comes back to Rome again.</P>
<P>This scathing romance, which abstains from love, instead it favors
romance as being something that darkly possesses you, as the flawed
protagonist leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth. He is reminded by
Francesca's studio boss (Giorgio) that he never even placed a wreath on
her grave and that she has been dead for two years.</P>
<P>It's film that basically is asking two unanswerable questions: How do
you explain a woman's love for a guy who is no good? How do you explain
a guy's love for a woman who is no good? Losey lets the pessimistic mood
of the story prevail as his answer... paralleling it to a displaced
world bereft of Eden.</P>
