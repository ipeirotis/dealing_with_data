<PRE>                            STAR TREK: GENERATIONS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Patrick Stewart, Malcolm McDowell, William Shatner,
Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner.
Screenplay:  Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga.
Director:  David Carson.</P>
<P>     Whether or not I would be considered a Trekker probably depends on
whom you would ask.  I have been a fan of both the original series and
its recently retired follow-up, as well as the even- numbered entries
in the film series.  However, I have never been one of those folks who
store away Trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits
of Spock vs. Data.  Somewhere along the line, the "Star Trek" film series
began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category,
and STAR TREK: GENERATIONS may be the natural conclusion of this
direction.  Its production values may be high, but the writing is
frequently appalling, and instead of a script has a collection of
references, in-jokes and ill-defined characters.</P>
<P>     GENERATIONS opens in the late 23rd Century, where members of the
original Enterprise crew, including Captain James T. Kirk (William
Shatner), are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear
that name.  No sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress
signal brings them to the Nexus, a mysterious ribbon of energy.  Among
those rescued from the Nexus is long-lived alien Dr. Soran (Malcolm
McDowell), but he is none-too-pleased at being back in the real world.
Seventy-eight years later, Soran is still trying to get back to the
Nexus, and again encounters an Enterprise, this one led by Captain
Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart).  Soran's plan involves destroying a
star with an inhabited planet, and the only hope for saving 230 million
people is the historic meeting of two Enterprise captains.</P>
<P>     I don't think it is an insult to fans of "Star Trek" to suggest that
to a certain extent, the particulars of a plot are not really the most
important elements in a "Trek" film.  It's about a chance to visit with
old friends, and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it
can be considered gravy.  But even that interpretation assumes that
characterization has to be consistent, and in GENERATIONS that just
doesn't happen.  Data (Brent Spiner) is particularly victimized by this
sloppy writing.  In the film's major sub-plot, Data decides to use a
chip which will give him human emotions, a chip he has had in his
possession for over a year.  What is his motivation for taking this
drastic and perhaps dangerous step?  He doesn't get a joke.  Once the
chip is in place, Spiner gets to have a lot of fun with Data's new
emotions, but the point is that he's no longer the Data we know.  If
the rest of the "Next Generation" cast fares any better, it's only
because they're on the screen so little that they're simply window
dressing.</P>
<P>     But then again, this story isn't really about the new crew.  It's
about Kirk and Picard, the cowboy and the politician, sharing the
screen.  The huge surprise is that William Shatner blows Patrick
Stewart away.  Perhaps because he knows this is his last go-round in
the part that made him a legend, Shatner looks like he's having the
time of his life; Stewart, on the other hand, borders on the
deferrential, and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as
everyone else in the cast.  Stewart's edginess is indicative of what
may be a very bad sign for Paramount's hopes to turn the new cast into
the same kind of franchise the original cast was:  these are clearly
the Not Ready for Big Screen Players.  By contrast, the prologue which
features Scotty (James Doohan) and Chekhov (Walter Koenig) is the
highlight of the film.  These characters have become part of the
popular mythology, and when they take over the Enterprise in a moment
of distress, it's a moment of high energy.  Only thirty years of
history can create a moment like that, and that's time this new crew
doesn't have.</P>
<P>     It certainly doesn't help that the plot they are stuck in is so
convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of
bread crumbs to find your way out again.  It's also loaded with little
gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn
to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition.  I wonder
whether anyone who is coming in cold to the "Trek" universe at this point
would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on.  And what
a waste of Malcolm McDowell, who could have been a great monomanical
villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for
his obsession.</P>
<P>     There are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to
pick at, but to do so would be to ignore GENERATIONS' major flaws.
However, I would like to make one recommendation:  seatbelts.  Not just
for the Enterprise crew, although you'd think by the 24th Century space
travel wouldn't involve rolling around on the floor during a battle.
No, I think the audience might need them more.  This journey is one
bumpy ride.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 GENERATIONS wrecks:  4.</PRE>
<PRE>.
