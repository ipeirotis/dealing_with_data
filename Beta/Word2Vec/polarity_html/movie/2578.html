                    CITY SLICKERS 2: THE LEGEND OF CURLY'S GOLD 
                        A Film Review by James Berardinelli

<P>     I'm not sure of the definition of "sequelitis", since it isn't the 
sort of term that can be found in a dictionary.  My best understanding is 
that it has something to do with the needless proliferation of 
unnecessary sequels.  To be sure, some series (such as STAR TREK or 
INDIANA JONES) are perfectly suited for future installments.  CITY 
SLICKERS, on the other hand, is a different matter.  I believe that Billy 
Crystal and the people at Columbia Pictures, left in a vulnerable state 
by the thought of more money, caught the sequelitis bug. </P>
<P>     The original CITY SLICKERS was a reasonably-entertaining, unassuming 
romp that crept into the theaters in the summer of 1991, and ended up 
becoming a highly-successful venture.  CITY SLICKERS 2, on the other 
hand, is planned as one of this summer's big blockbusters, so anything 
less than a nine-figure gross is going to disappoint.  However, while the 
first movie was of the hit-and-miss variety, this installment is all 
miss-and-miss. </P>
<P>     Billy Crystal is back as Mitch Robbins, a man whose fortieth 
birthday has spawned a mini mid-life crisis.  One night, while examining 
a hat that had once belonged to the late, lamented Curly, Mitch discovers 
what appears to be a treasure map (leading to $1 million in solid gold).  
After a trip to a library to verify the map's legitimacy, the "CITY 
SLICKERS" are off again into the wild west.  This time, Mitch is joined 
by best friend Phil (Daniel Stern), brother Glen (Jon Lovitz), and 
Curly's long-lost twin, Duke (Jack Palance).   </P>
<P>     The only thing I'll give the production team credit for is that they 
didn't try to re-hash the first movie.  Too many sequels are simply 
uninspired reworkings of the original material.  CITY SLICKERS 2, 
however, does something new.  The problem is that this "something" 
doesn't work. </P>
<P>     Most discouraging is that the movie isn't especially funny.  Oh, 
there are laughs to be had here and there, but nothing memorable.  
Considering that the comic talents of both Billy Crystal and Jon Lovitz 
are represented on screen, this is surprising.  However, both men are 
restrained, which leaves the most humorous material to Daniel Stern.  The 
result:  as far as western comedies go, MAVERICK has this film trampled 
underfoot. </P>
<P>     Speaking of MAVERICK, there are quite a few similarities between the 
Mel Gibson/Richard Donner flick and this one.  Both have a runaway 
coach/wagon sequence, both feature a similar playful tone, both are 
nicely photographed, and both run on for too long.  For me, the 
difference is that I walked out of MAVERICK satisfied, and out of CITY 
SLICKERS 2 disappointed. </P>
<P>     Dramatically, this film is an amalgamation of bad cliches.  None of 
the various bonding sequences have any sense of depth, and the characters 
have been reduced to caricatures.  Everyone is still likable, but that's 
the only trait the main four can claim, and affability by itself is 
tantamount to being boring. </P>
<P>     Movie references abound, although it's difficult to figure out why 
some of them are there in the first place.  THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA 
MADRE stuff is self-evident, as in the INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF 
DOOM sequence, but THE GODFATHER?   </P>
<P>     The conclusion is sappier than usual for a Lowell Ganz/Babaloo 
Mandel film.  These two have made a career out of happy endings, so it 
should come as no surprise that everything works out fine.  The manner in 
which the various threads are tied together is enough to send even the 
most devout fan of this type of movie into sugar shock.</P>
<P>     When money is involved, I no longer bother to ask why a particular 
film was made.  It may be a bad idea, but so what?.  Who cares that an 
inferior project like this cheapens the original?  With this movie, 
there's a bankable star, previously-established characters, and a 
recognizable name.  Given all that, who needs an interesting script? </P>
<P>     Westerns and western comedies appear to be big this summer; 
hopefully, CITY SLICKERS 2 represents the least enjoyable of the bunch - 
otherwise, it's going to be a long wait until Labor Day. </P>
