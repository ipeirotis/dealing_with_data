<P>     THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER will probably be the cleverest stupid film
we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film.  It's
confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious
direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp
character interaction.  That, however, is what happens when legendary
screenwriter William Goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally
predictable conspiracy thriller. The punched-up punch lines are ever on
the verge of convincing you THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER has a brain in its
head, even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face
with its lack of common sense.</P>
<P>     Our hero is warrant officer Paul Brenner, a brash investigator for
the U. S. Army's Criminal Investigation Division.  His latest case is the
murder of Captain Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stefanson) at a Georgia base,
the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and
strangulation.  Complicating the case is the fact that Capt. Campbell is
the daughter of General Joe Campbell (James Cromwell), a war hero and
potential vice-presidential nominee.  General Campbell wants to keep the
case out of the press, which gives Brenner only the 36 hours before the
FBI steps in.  Teamed with rape investigator Sarah Sunhill (Madeleine
Stowe) -- who, coincidentally enough, once had a romantic relationship
with Brenner -- Brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late
captain's past that make the case ever more sordid.</P>
<P>     If only the sordidness were the worst of THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER's
problems.  Scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than
necessary, their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light
sleaze.  Director Simon West likely thinks he's covered himself by
juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers, but all he does
is prove himself dependent on visual cliches, which is the film's fatal
flaw.  It's a trend he continues for two hours, taking the story's few
virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them.
Characters who may (wink wink) turn out to be villains are photographed in
ominous shadow; cutaway inserts of the Captain Campbell's still-living
face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention
spans.  West just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of
THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER.  He even turns a scene of footage shown on CNN
into an excuse for slow-fade edits.</P>
<P>     Bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to
distract you from its smell.  The slickest scene finds Brenner squaring
off with Captain Campbell's mentor, a psychological warfare expert named
Moore (James Woods).  There's something invigorating about watching two
smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another.
Indeed, Travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based
on his delight at provoking authority figures (to the local sheriff of the
Georgia county: "Shouldn't you be out night-sticking the colored folk?").
Even the lame device of Brenner and Sunhill's sexual history provides a
few winning zingers.  Goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than
you'll find in most so-called comedies.</P>
<P>     Dialogue, unfortunately, just isn't enough to make a quality script.
It's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously
when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner (an idiotic
inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene) and too lucky for it
to last any longer (not one but two occasions where Brenner catches a
vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye).  By the time THE
GENERAL'S DAUGHTER wanders towards its over-wrought, psycho-in-the-rain
finale, West's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film
occasionally fun.  It's silly and pretentious film-making, but at least
it provides a giggle or five.  Goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out
of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 base closures:  4.</PRE>
