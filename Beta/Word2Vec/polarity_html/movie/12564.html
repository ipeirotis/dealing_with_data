<P>     Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have thrown down the gauntlet to film
critics...or, at the very least, to two film critics in particular.  In
GODZILLA, the latest summer spectacle-cum-marketing assault from the
creators of INDEPENDENCE DAY, a mutant reptile from the South Pacific
comes to New York City on a rampage, much to the consternation of the
city's blustering mayor (Michael Lerner).  A corpulent fellow with
familiar graying hair and glasses, the mayor noshes on Hershey's kisses
between campaign stops where he gives citizens his "Thumbs Up for New
York" signal.  Oh, and his name is Mayor Ebert.  Oh, and he has an
ineffectual, balding assistant named Gene.</P>
<P>     I don't know why Emmerich and Devlin found this snarky fit of
retaliatory pique necessary.  Certainly the negative reviews of Gene
Siskel and Roger Ebert didn't hurt the box office take of "ID4," which
somehow overcame two thumbs down to gross $300 million in North America.
GODZILLA is certain to be similarly critic-proof, pitting a massive CGI
beast against intrepid biologist Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), his
former girlfriend and aspiring reporter Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) a
mysterious Frenchman (Jean Reno), the entire U.S. Army and the fortunes of
every other summer film standing in its path.  Is critical acceptance so
important to the film-makers that doing well isn't good enough as the best
revenge?</P>
<P>     If such is the case, here's a simple bit of advice for Emmerich and
Devlin:  make better movies.  GODZILLA is a baby step in the right
direction, if for no other reason than that it's more honest in its
big-budget intentions than the dopey and grandiose INDEPENDENCE DAY.
Using ALIENS and JURASSIC PARK as its models rather than the adventures of
its rubber-suited predecessor, GODZILLA takes only half an hour before the
scaly behemoth hits the Big Apple and turns midtown Manhattan into a
Jurassic parking lot.  This sequence is followed by a dizzying helicopter
chase through the man-made canyons, which is followed by an underwater
encounter with submarines, which is followed by a search for what may be
the creature's nest, and so on.  The sheer variety of situations insures a
consistent level of interest, while simultaneously insuring several unique
levels for the inevitable Sony PlayStation version of the game.</P>
<P>     Whenever the film rests on human shoulders, however, you could sprain
your eyeballs from rolling them.  Continuing their uncanny knack for inane
back-story, Emmerich and Devlin create a mayo-on-white-bread relationship
dynamic between Broderick and Pitillo, and a mission for Reno which makes
less and less sense every moment I think about it.  The dialogue is
hopelessly feeble, the attempts at humor strained even by action movie
standards, and the characters so caricatured that Al Hirschfeld should
have drawn them.  Most unforgivably, GODZILLA wastes the immense comic
talents of Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer, restricting Azaria to loyal
sidekick duty as Pitillo's cameraman and leaving Shearer to do a
half-hearted (and less animated) version of his "The Simpsons" anchorman
Kent Brockman.  Even the always-appealing Broderick looks baffled by how
to be charming in such a suffocating role.</P>
<P>     At least Emmerich sends the audience home on a high note, closing
GODZILLA with a superb sequence in which Godzilla chases a cab through the
city, eventually onto the Brooklyn Bridge.  It's a sharp piece of action
film-making, and not the only one.  Yet GODZILLA can't get by on its
big-ness alone; in fact, the visuals sometimes seem decidedly less than
state-of-the-art, particularly when our heroes are threatened inside
Madison Square Garden.  When a blockbuster exists solely to impress you
with "you gotta see this" tricks, it's tough not to be disappointed when
you've seen the tricks before, and seen them done better.  There are ways
around that disappointment, though, which Emmerich and Devlin should
ponder:  Write better scripts.  Create real characters.  Make better
movies.  Either that, or continue blaming the messengers for the way they
hold their thumbs.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 monster islands:  5.</PRE>
