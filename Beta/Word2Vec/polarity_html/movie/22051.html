<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a must see film for historical reasons or if you are a film
buff. Its cinematic influence is tremendous on so many great directors
that range from Fritz Lang to Billy Wilder. Because of its dark story
and unique set designs (these were done by artists Walter Reimann and
Walter Röhrig and designer Hermann Warm), where black paint was used to
represent the shadows that were painted on the cardboard scenery of
crooked buildings.  As a result of WW1, the post-war Germany economy was
in a deplorable state and the studio only had one light to use, which
couldn't light the entire set adequately. So they improvised and created
an eerie style that brought the artistic German Expressionist movement
into the film.</P>
<P>This unique film influenced the genres of horror, children's fairy
tales, and crime films from the '20s - '50s, and by using the same style
of lighting and dark mood as these mystery stories, they became known as
noir films after WW11.</P>
<P>The story begins with the tiny but menacing looking Dr. Caligari (Werner
Krauss-he remained in Nazi Germany and later on played the anti-Semite
in "Jud Suss") going to town hall to get a permit to open a booth at the
local fair with his somnambulist act. The painted set of the town hall
is cramped with all the buildings on an angle, with narrow passages, low
ceilings, gray and black shadows covering the white walls, and the
clerks sitting way up on very elongated stools. They react to this mad
looking character by laughing at him, until he finally succeeds in
getting his permit.</P>
<P>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is the story of murder and intrigue set in
the small German town of Holstenwall. Francis (Friedric Feher), the
narrator, acts as the voice of reason, explaining to the viewer what
really happened during that time, as he relates his horror story to an
older, skeptical man, as they are viewed sitting on a park bench.</P>
<P>Francis is the young lover and friendly rival of the same sweet girl,
Jane (Lil Dagover), of his best friend, Alan (Hans Heinrich). They had
the misfortune of attending the carnival and Alan made the fatal mistake
of asking the somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt), a thin, ashen
appearing man, who is under the charge of Dr. Caligari and awakened by
him after an eternal sleep, "How long do I have to live?" Cesare
responds, "Until dawn."</P>
<P>True enough, before the next day begins, Alan is seen through the
shadows being knifed to death. He is the second murder victim
discovered. The town clerk was also killed on the day Dr. Caligari
arrived. Francis reports his suspicions to the police that it is Dr.
Caligari behind these killings, but the police soon pick up a criminal
(Rudolf ) who is about to knife an old lady and charge him with all the
murders, even though, he admits only to the attempted murder but not to
the other two killings.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Jane's old man (Lettinger) has disappeared and she goes to
the carnival looking for him. She meets Dr. Caligari there and he shows
off to her Cesare sleeping like a zombie in his cabinet. Jane gets bad
feelings about these two characters, as Dr. Caligari ogles her. So, she
leaves.</P>
<P>This seemingly simple murder plot, of a crazed medieval-type of
Svengali, who orders his somnambulist to do his killings, is much more
complex than that, and it is one of the reasons that this film has meant
so much to so many different people at different time periods. A case
can be made for it, as an example of what happened to the collective
German psyche after the first war and how the degenerate ideals of
Nazism seeped into the German being.</P>
<P>The simple explanation for the film's success, a success that is hard to
deny, is that the subversive story is an allegory for an evil government
(Dr. Caligari) that brainwashes its people (Cesare) to commit crimes it
wants carried out. By its odd style, accented mannerisms, all the actors
wearing grotesque makeup, and exhibiting a stagy acting method, it
becomes a very unsettling film. Through its amazing sets, the film best
expresses the insanity of its theme, and the story enhances this theme,
as the authorities are shown to be either incompetent or uncaring, and
madness proves to be the staple of the film.</P>
<P>It was brought to America by Samuel Goldwyn in 1921 and made an
immediate impression on certain knowledgeable film critics in the U.S..</P>
<P>The odd twist the story takes, just when you assume that you know in
which direction the film is going, is when Cesare, clad-in-all-black, is
ordered into the bedroom of Jane to knife her to death but is instead
attracted to her, with thoughts of rape overcoming his command to kill.
When she screams and awakens her household, he is forced to kidnap her.
This is the story that the narrator is telling.</P>
<P>Francis is convinced that Caligari is behind these crimes, but since he
kept watch on him and had the doctor show him Cesare in his cabinet
asleep, he has to admit that they did not leave their quarters and,
therefore, he reasons, they couldn't have attacked Jane. It will later
turn out that there is a dummy there in place of Cesare. But it is all
so confusing, that the possibility exists the narrator is just making
this whole thing up.</P>
<P>It turns out, there was a mountebank named 'Caligari' in 1612, in Italy,
who had a somnambulist that he trained to commit murder. This asylum
director must have liked what he read about the evil magician, with the
idea that imitation is the best form of flattery, as this book is found
in his desk. Francis discovers this secret when he has access to the
director's office while visiting the asylum and going through the
director's books while waiting for him to return; and, when he sees who
the director is, he takes him for the lunatic killer.</P>
<P>The story remains purposefully unclear and bizarre, and in its supposed
climax, Caligari is put under restraint by the orderlies, as Francis
tells them his story and they find Cesare's dead body. But the story
doesn't end on this note.</P>
<P>The reason for the confusion, is that the German government interfered
with Robert Wiene's film, who was then forced to use a different
beginning and ending to his film where the entire message was supposed
to be reversed. They did not want a film with the message that authority
is not to be trusted and should be subject to severe questioning.</P>
<P>This story is now viewed from the point of view of a "framing device,"
as it appears that  all that previously happened could be derived from
the narrator's deranged imagination.</P>
<P>Francis is now through telling his tale in the park, where he sees his
girlfriend go sleepwalking by, and both men return to the asylum where
they see Cesare alive and Dr. Caligari coming down the stairs and Jane
thinking she is a queen, who refuses his advances by telling him that a
queen can't follow the dictates of her heart when it comes to romance.
When Francis accuses Caligari of being the killer who was in his
fantasy, this time the orderlies, in the film's anticlimax, restrain
Francis in a strait-jacket. The last chilling words coming from Dr.
Caligari, who is now seen as a more benevolent soul, go loosely like
this: boy, have I got a cure for you.</P>
<P>Caligari, however limited in scope, is still a powerhouse of a horror
film, a significant breakthrough in style and in expression: a poetical
vision. Even in its altered story form, the film is still spellbinding
and weird, as its ambiguity makes for many interpretations. It is even
possible, to make a case for Francis as being the deranged killer of his
best friend. Either Francis or Caligari could be the lunatic. This note
of ambiguity, instead of spoiling the story, only adds further intrigue.
Everyone realizes that the world we live in has elements of evil and
mystery in it. This tale of lunacy smolders in our psyches and allows us
to look at this story's skewed world without knowing all the answers. We
are left wondering if there could ever be justice in this world, as
corrupt powers always seem to have a way of covering up their misdeeds.</P>
