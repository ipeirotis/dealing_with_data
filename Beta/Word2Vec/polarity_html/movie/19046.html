<PRE>THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>The U.S. Army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which
stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable
must be done.  One particular field manual is known as the FM 22-5,
which among other things, covers the practice of saluting.  Under the
"saluting" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is
rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior
officer.  The salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual
present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the
detail, and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the
detail.  In any event, the salute is rendered only by the man (or
woman) in charge, rather than by the whole group.  Almost at the very
beginning of THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER, we see a general's motorcade
passing a work detail.  Everyone salutes.  It looked impressive, but
it just wasn't right.  That little bit showed me that someone either
didn't do the appropriate research, or made the conscious decision to
go with style over substance for the scene.  In fact, this would serve
as a metaphor for the rest of the picture, as it seems director Simon
West tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he
forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to
a good movie.  What results is a film that looks good, but like that
one scene, just isn't right.</P>
<P>The first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example.  Paul Brenner
(John Travolta) is an agent for the Army's Criminal Investigation
Division, undercover at a Georgia Army base to investigate an illegal
arms sale.  Prior to the transaction, the buyer gets a whiff that
Brenner isn't the unscrupulous supply sergeant he's supposed to be,
and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat
on which Brenner is living.  So ensues a cat and mouse action sequence
which ends like a certain scene in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (we'll just
say that it involves propellers). Brenner then receives new orders
when the commanding general's daughter, Captain Elisabeth Campbell
(Leslie Stefanson), is found naked, bound, and dead on one of the
base's training ranges.  He is teamed with rape investigator Sarah
Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly
gruesome murder.  What I want to know is why the whole action scene
with the arms buyer was even necessary.  It gives no insight into
Brenner, other than the fact that he's a little cocky.  Does the arms
subplot turn up later?  No, so why add this extra running time to the
film?  The answer:  It looked cool.</P>
<P>Or how about the "atmosphere"?  The beginning of THE GENERAL'S
DAUGHTER presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees,
dirt roads, sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque
music.  Nice immersion in the setting, but it soon doesn't matter, for
when the film's plot shifts over to the murder investigation, so does
the entire mood.  No attention is paid to the location of the story,
and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme.  Did
the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie?
Instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film,
we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another, just
because the director thought he should show off some of the
countryside.</P>
<P>The above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is
another problem with this movie.  As I've already mentioned, an entire
section of the film doesn't jibe with the rest, and the
characterization only adds to the difficulty.  Brenner, who comes
across as a man with little respect for authority, suddenly snaps to
in the presence of General Campbell (James Cromwell) and utters some
of the corniest "yes, sir"s I've ever heard.  He even delivers an
emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the
person who killed the General's daughter, even though he was totally
flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous.
Sunhill, who initially comes across as a professional investigator,
utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information,
and even revels in her ingenuity.   Both characters are protagonists,
but it's hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over
the place, and in some cases, simply unappealing. </P>
<P>I could imagine that during filming, West would shoot a scene, then
take the actors aside and tell them, "Let's do it again, but this
time, I want more."  I say this because although Travolta and Stowe
are normally very good, in this film they overact in most of their
scenes.  An even worse offender is Clarence Williams III as the
general's aide, Colonel Fowler.  I swear the guy says all of his lines
from the position of attention.  A far cry from his days as Linc in
"The Mod Squad", I can't help but think he was acting from West's
direction.  A couple of side characters including a West Point
psychologist (John Beasly) and a young female private (Ariyan A.
Johnson) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear.  The only two
actors who seem to have escaped West's influence are James Woods, who
provides a good performance as Colonel Moore, Elisabeth's mentor at
the Psychological Operations unit, and Timothy Hutton as Colonel Kent
of the Military Police.  Woods relishes the role of a man whose job is
playing with people's minds, and does so without ever taking it over
the top.  Hutton just kind of hangs around, but at least he wasn't
overacting.</P>
<P>I haven't read the Nelson DeMille novel on which this movie was based,
but I'll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book
form.  The movie version has got characters which come and go with
little or nothing to do except fill up space, or provide bits of
information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing
the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is
finished.  Every time we're presented with some new aspect to the
case, West gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it's the
most momentous discovery ever, but the information is not used by the
investigators at all.  Instead, when conclusions are drawn, they are
such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful
investigations are not based on facts, but lucky guesses instead.  The
Army should have saved time by bringing in Brennan and Sunhill,
letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects, then
letting them guess who the killer was.  Would've been over in a half
hour.</P>
<P>The film finishes with a sort of bookend, featuring the same style and
southern scenery as the very beginning.  Literally during the closing
credits, we get to see Brennan get in his car and drive off, then we
get to see Sunhill get in her car and drive off.  They both seem kind
of happy.  Maybe they were driving away from Simon West.</P>
