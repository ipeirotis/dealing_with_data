<P>I remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at Cannes over a
year ago, picking up the Grand Jury Prize at the festival. 'Holocaust
comedy receives standing ovation', the headlines read. Intrigued by this
statement, I looked up information on the film and found that, sure enough,
Life is Beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the
last thousand years. Even though the movie was extremely well-received by
critics and public alike, I couldn't help but be disgusted at this notion;
human tragedy is not something I feel should be celebrated. </P>
<P>Only now do I see the error of my ways. After finally viewing the film for
myself after avoiding it for some time, it became clear that it is not, as
the headlines proclaimed, a "Holocaust comedy"; on the contrary, Life is
Beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in
Nazi deathcamps. Rather, it focuses on the relationship between a father
and his son, who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of
their situation. </P>
<P>Roberto Benigni (who also wrote and directed the movie) stars as Guido
Orefice, a Chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who, as the film
opens, is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher
(Nicoletta Braschi, Benigni real life spouse). Through the course of the
first hour or so, we see Guido striving to get the attention of this
"beautiful princess", as he calls her. Employing the magic of laughter, the
Italian comedian wins her heart and together, they raise a young boy named
Giosue (child actor Giorgio Cantarini). Life treats them well until
Hitler's minions rise to power, and the family is whisked away to a German
camp, where Guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son's
innocence no matter what the sacrifice. </P>
<P>Granted, it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the
concentration camp, but it does not pull a "Hogan's Heros" and make light
of the slaughtering of some six million innocent Jews. Somehow, it achieves
hilarity without disrespecting it's gravely serious subject. </P>
<P>So, we've established that Life is Beautiful is not a "Holocaust comedy".
But, there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that
really disturbs me. The film, despite critic's declarations of it being a
"triumph of the human spirit", is no such thing; not in my eyes, anyway.
Some have called the story an "affirmation of the beauty of life", but I
say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man's capability of denial
masquerading as an endearing comedy. The film's ending has been recognized
as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently, but I
found it to be truly discerning and upsetting. Essentially, Life is
Beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film.
However, I am not denying the movie's greatness. Believe me, it's
fantastic. I'm just saying that I think Benigni did something different
than what most people are interpreting it as. </P>
<P>But perhaps I'm reading more into the movie than is really there. Maybe the
film's brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the
meaning of it in any way they see fit. In fact, maybe Roberto Benigni has
made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out
of a movie exactly what you put into it. </P>
