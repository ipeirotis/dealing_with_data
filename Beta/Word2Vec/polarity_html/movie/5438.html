<P>     It seems that once every dozen-or-so years, Sean Connery has the 
urge to go back into Bondage.  After turning in his tuxedo and Aston 
Martin following 1971's DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, Connery ventured into the 
acting market as a free agent.  His vow to "never again" play 007 held 
for a little over a decade.  Lured back by an enormous sum of money and 
the offer of limited creative control, Connery returned to Her Majesty's 
Secret Service in 1983, with the "unofficial" Bond entry, NEVER SAY 
NEVER AGAIN.  Now, in 1996's THE ROCK, the veteran actor has once more 
come home to the action genre.  Granted, his character is called John 
Mason, not James Bond, but Connery plays him exactly as he might portray 
a sixty-something version of the world-renowned British spy.  </P>
<P>     THE ROCK is the summer of 1996's first "traditional" action film.  
There are no tornadoes to chase or dragons to slay, and, while the plot 
certainly isn't Dostoevsky, it beats MISSION IMPOSSIBLE's swiss-cheese-
like storyline hands down.  There's some wry humor amidst all the 
wreckage from car chases and missile strikes, and a few of the 
characters are allowed to break through their stereotypical boundaries.  
Not surprisingly, the energy level is high, and there's plenty of 
action, ranking this film alongside BROKEN ARROW and EXECUTIVE DECISION 
among the year's best high-adrenaline offerings.  </P>
<P>     As is often the case with action films, a simple premise is the 
most effective.  Here, it's that a group of ex-Marines have stolen 15 VX 
gas rockets and are threatening to launch a lethal strike on the San 
Francisco Bay area if their demands aren't met.  Led by war hero and 
living legend, Brigadier General Frank Hummel (Ed Harris), the crack 
platoon has holed up on Alcatraz, where they're holding 81 civilians 
hostage.  The U.S. government responds by sending a troop of Navy SEALS 
on a secret raid, using the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the island as 
their entranceway.  Their guide is the only man ever to escape from the 
legendary prison:  ex-SAS operative, John Mason (Connery).  Also in the 
party is FBI agent Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), an admitted 
"chemical superfreak" who has the knowledge and experience to defuse 
Hummel's rockets.</P>
<P>     The cast is first rate.  Nicolas Cage, last year's Best Actor Oscar 
winner, doesn't excel as an action hero, but he's a good enough 
performer to forge a likable character.  Ed Harris portrays a 
surprisingly sympathetic bad guy.  Unlike most villains in this sort of 
movie, his Hummel isn't greedy or mad -- just angry.  He's championing a 
cause ("this isn't about terrorism -- it's about justice"), and feels 
that drastic action is the only way to get people to listen to him.  
David Morse, who left an impression in last year's THE CROSSING GUARD, 
is Hummel's right-hand man.  John Spencer portrays the FBI director, 
Michael Biehn is the SEAL team leader, and Vanessa Marcil is Goodspeed's 
pregnant fiancee, who has been placed in harm's way.</P>
<P>     But the real standout is, of course, Connery.  Having lost none of 
his charisma with age, the veteran actor puts to use his mastery of 
mixing humor and action.  Just like Bond, Mason does all his shooting 
and battling with tongue in cheek.  Along the way, he develops a nice 
rapport with Goodspeed, with the two actors clicking in the best "buddy 
movie" fashion.</P>
<P>     THE ROCK's running time could have been trimmed.  There's no reason 
for it to last a bloated one-hundred thirty-five minutes (unless it's 
trying to rival the Bond films for length).  Much of the early, 
character-building material could have been shortened without damaging 
the complexity of the principal trio, and certain aspects of the script 
might have benefiting from a little tightening up.  Flaws aside, 
however, THE ROCK still represents a loud, fast-paced night's worth of 
entertainment.  There are all the expected shoot-outs, explosions, and 
death-defying stunts.  Director Michael Bay (BAD BOYS) doesn't break new 
ground, but he displays his command of the genre by keeping the familiar 
from becoming boring.  His steals from Quentin Tarantino (a master of 
theft in his own right) and others fit seamlessly into this movie.</P>
<P>     Producers Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have a highly-
successful resume that includes TOP GUN and CRIMSON TIDE.  THE ROCK will 
add more luster to that reputation.  Since TWISTER and MISSION 
IMPOSSIBLE are losing a fraction of their tremendous momentum, THE ROCK 
is poised to storm past them.  With Connery, Cage, Harris, and a host of 
harrowing action sequences, this is the kind of breath-stealing summer 
entertainment that audiences crave.  Although not as expertly-crafted as 
DIE HARD or SPEED, THE ROCK is exhausting in its own right -- and that's 
just one of several convincing reasons to see this film.</P>
