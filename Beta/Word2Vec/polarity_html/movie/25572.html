<P>     JESUS' SON is a film about addiction -- only it's not, really. The
way we're used to seeing films about addiction, there's a message, a
lesson, an agenda. Drugs are bad, the effects of drugs on users and their
immediate circle of acquaintances are worse, and our hero would be a
perfectly happy and productive member of society if not for that thing he
wouldn't just say no to. These tend to be films in which the ostensible
messed-up protagonist isn't really the center of the film. It's the needle
that's the center of the film, or the bottle, or the rolled-up $100 bill. 
Addiction isn't just the theme; it's the star.</P>
<P>     So let's re-phrase that introduction: JESUS' SON is a film about FH
(Billy Crudup) -- short for F***head -- a man who eventually becomes an
addict. He's no angel even before his addiction, however, a loner who
stumbles one day in the early 1970s into a party where he meets Michelle
(Samantha Morton). It's Michelle who eventually introduces him to the
wonderful world of heroin, and the two find themselves in a tumultuous
relationship over the space of a few years. Along the way, FH has himself
some crazy misadventures: helping a drunken pal (Denis Leary) tear up a
house for scrap wire; sharing emergency room ordeals with a pill-popping
orderly (Jack Black); and so on. Then Michelle leaves him, setting him
down the difficult road to sobriety.</P>
<P>     Actually, Michelle has already left him when JESUS' SON begins, which
is typical of the frisky, zig-zagging approach taken in adapting Denis
Johnson's collection of short stories. FH narrates his story with all the
straight-ahead narrative lucidity you'd expect of a perpetually stoned
guy; he riccochets back and forth in time, picking up one thread of the 
story in the middle of another story when he recalls something he's
forgotten to tell us. Director Alison Maclean and her trio of writers give
JESUS' SON a playfulness that's entertaining even as it never shies away
from the darkest sides of addiction. In one scene, a romantic song plays
while the camera tracks slowly toward a motel room bed, to reveal not a
lovers' embrace, but FH helping Michelle fix; in another, a split screen
reveals the alternate fates of two characters who have both taken the same
bad drugs. It's a film with the wonderfully scrambled logic of drug use
itself.</P>
<P>     But in case you missed the caveat, this is not exactly a film about
addiction. Billy Crudup gives a magnetic performance as FH, a peripatetic 
loser who has been given that derogatory nickname even before he ever
picks up a needle. In fact, his mutually self-destructive relationship
with Michelle is portrayed as a strangely stabilizing influence in his
fragmented life. Crudup finds a cohesiveness to FH's character through the
episodic film, and even manages to keep up with Jack Black's
scene-stealing orderly in the film's most hilarious segments. JESUS' SON
works not because the individual scenes are so effective (though they
are) or because the portrayal of addiction is so grimly affecting (because
it is not), but because FH is a great anchor for a film that heads in so
many different directions.</P>
<P>     Perhaps inevitably, JESUS' SON eventually turns to the subject of
FH's attempts to get straight, and it's a bit depressing that the film
loses so much steam once drugs are no longer involved. The individual
moments -- FH's fascination with a Menonite woman, a conversation with an
aging fellow patient in rehab (Dennis Hopper), a relationship with a
member of his support group (Holly Hunter) -- feel more isolated, and it
begins to appear that there's no end in sight. Perhaps the come-down is
relative after such a wonderful first hour; perhaps there's nothing for an
episodic film to do but find a somewhat arbitrary place to stop. Even the
sluggish conclusion can't diminish the surprising, darkly comic experience
of JESUS' SON, however. Even once FH is clean, there are still problems
for him to deal with. How refreshing to see addiction take a back seat to
the addict, to see the needle in its appropriate place as supporting
player.</P>
