<P>     With all apologies to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and MIRACLE ON 34TH
STREET, Charles Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL is probably the best-loved,
most often retold Christmas story of them all.  There's something in its
message of spiritual rebirth and redemption that strikes a responsive
chord in all of us, especially in an age when the focus of the holiday
season has shifted more to material goods than altruism.  Most everyone,
I'm sure, recognizes a little bit of Scrooge in themselves.</P>
<P>     In one form or another (not counting TV series Christmas episodes),
A CHRISTMAS CAROL has been remade over a dozen times--once with
Muppets, once with Mickey Mouse, several times as cartoons, and once as
an updated, mean-spirited parody (SCROOGED).  The best production of all
was the 1951 black-and-white classic with Alistair Sim as the detestable
skinflint.  Then there's this version, a lavish musical written by
Leslie Bricusse (DR. DOLITTLE).</P>
<P>     It can be debated at endless length whether it's a good idea to
inject song-and-dance numbers into Dickens' tale.  Purists probably
don't like it, but if it can be done with Victor Hugo's LES MISERABLES,
there's no reason why it can't succeed with A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  So, the
problem with SCROOGE isn't the concept itself as much as the execution.
Even though Bricusse was given an Oscar nomination for the movie, the
songs (with one exception:  "Thank You Very Much") are instantly
forgettable.  Unlike the great musicals, where you might find yourself
humming a tune a few days later, with SCROOGE, you'll be lucky if you
remember the name of one of the songs a few hours later.</P>
<P>     The screenplay is faithful to the original story.  Miserly old
Scrooge (Albert Finney), who loves nothing so much as his money and
hates the good cheer of Christmas time, goes home one Christmas Eve to
be visited by four ghosts.  The first, that of his dead partner, Jacob
Marley (Alec Guinness) warns him of the penalty for mean-spiritedness.
The second, The Ghost of Christmas Past (Edith Evans), takes Scrooge on
a tour of happier times long gone.  The third, The Ghost of Christmas
Present (Kenneth More), shows him how friends and family are spending
the holiday this year.  And the fourth, The Ghost of Christmas Yet to
Come (Paddy Stone), gives Scrooge a glimpse into a grim future of
cemeteries, death, and Hell.</P>
<P>     Of all the Scrooges to pass across the screen, none has been as
convincing or memorable as Alistair Sim.  There has been no shortage of
contenders--George C. Scott, Michael Caine, and Bill Murray have all
taken turns at the part, with varying success.  Albert Finney, one of
today's best character actors, places himself somewhere in the middle of
the pack with this hammy, albeit enjoyable, portrayal.</P>
<P>     If there's a standout performance in SCROOGE, it belongs to Alec
Guinness, who turns in an unconventionally energetic and sadistically
high-spirited version of Jacob Marley's ghost.  Never before nor since
has Marley been played with such a bizarre mixture of the nasty and the
good-natured.  Kenneth More is suitably jovial and larger-than-life as
the boisterous Ghost of Christmas Present.  Everyone else, however, is
less-than-memorable.</P>
<P>     SCROOGE is basically a harmless, fitfully enjoyable version of the
timeless classic, and worth a look for those who have had their fill of
the more serious adaptations.  It's entirely suitable for family viewing
and, if the mood tends to become a little too sweet at times, keep in
mind the season it was designed for.</P>
