<PRE>Apocalypse Now
A film by Francis Coppola
Starring: Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, and =
Larry Fishburne</PRE>
<P>    It is with hesitance that I call "Apocalypse Now" a masterpiece.  
Certainly, it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever 
made, with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease, and 
some of the finest actors of the 1970's.  The plot, an adaptation of 
Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness", was set in Vietnam, and the timing 
of the film was supposed to be brilliant, coming on the heels of the end 
of the war.</P>
<P>"Apocalypse" certainly has its moments, some of which are the finest 
in film history.  The plot is fairly simple.  Captain Willard (Sheen), 
is a troubled soldier who came back to Hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty.  
His mission is simple: take a boat up to Cambodian territory, and 
destroy the command of renegade Colonel Kurtz (Brando) "with extreme 
prejudice".  Along the way, Willard runs into a series of adventures, 
including one with Lt. Col. Kilgore (Duvall), and a strange encounter 
with Playboy bunnies.  Willard' s four person crew finally make it to 
Kurtz' compound, where he discovers Kurtz has set himself up as a god 
among the natives.  Willard's experiences with Kurtz take up the last 
half-hour, with a confrontation and eventual ending.</P>
<P>The movie is visually breathtaking.  The battle scenes are 
exquisitely done, and the score is brilliant, setting a murky mood of 
darkness that is first-rate.  The collage of disturbing images that 
Coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening.  The vast 
amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning, and there are 
many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire 
movie.  The journey to Kurtz' camp is quite a ride, with psychosis 
setting in on almost every character.  The most interesting one is 
Kilgore, the Lt. Col. who cares more about the surf than about the 
mission.  It is at times revolting, psychotic, and incredible, and it is 
one hell of a movie.  The scenes are bold, inventive, and powerful, and 
the acting is stunning, especially be Sheen, Duvall, and Fishburne.  The 
narration is exquisite, as is the mystery of Kurtz.  Coppola sets about 
a hallucinatory ride through Vietnam, kind of like "Saving Private Ryan" 
on LSD.  The film is jarring in its implications, and psychotic in its 
execution.</P>
<P>The problems come when the film slows down.  One of the major scenes 
in the film, where the boat arrives at the final Army checkpoint before 
they start their search for Kurtz, is a colossal mess.  The dialogue is 
confusing, the lighting is atrocious, and the scene drags on for 10 
terrible minutes of film.  The true problems happen after the crew does 
come into the Kurtz compound.  The film slows down to a drag.  Sheen 
seems forever captured by a madman, played by Brando is a lazy 
performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received.  Brando 
is in the film for no more than 15 minutes, but is bathed in shadows the 
entire time, making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic.  
The scenes are poorly done, the dialogue is muffled, and the whole mess 
is utterly confusing beyond all belief.  Sheen seems to adore this man, 
but why the viewers are never told.  The entire journey is supposed to 
be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like Kurtz, but the 
scenes fall way short of expectations.  Granted, it has its moments, 
which are brutally horrific, but the general feeling is one of 
confusion.  Brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir, and my 
feeling was that this could never be a great man, this could never be a 
man who inspires hundreds to follow him, so why do they do it?  There 
are moments of brilliance, but the visual confusion dilutes the power of 
the scene.  There are too many questions left unanswered with the 
character of Kurtz to have a satisfying ending.</P>
<P>The finest scene at the end is Sheen's escape, and his entrace into 
the temple.  His rise out of the water, with the smoke coming off of his 
slicked head, is a brilliant 30 seconds of film.  Yet, you cannot shake 
the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done.  The 
psychotic ride is unforgettable at times, and indeed the film on the 
whole is very good.  It is a stunningly flawed expression of film, for 
it addresses major issues, such as man's mental stamina during bouts of 
war.  But one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have 
so much more powerful, had the character of Kurtz been more explored, 
and had Sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was 
destined for.  There is too much good material in here not to be called 
a masterpiece, but it could have been so much more rewarding.</P>
