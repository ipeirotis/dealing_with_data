<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Daringly enough, this leftist sympathizing political drama was made
during the remaining days of the rightist Colonels' regime. It is one of
those extra long (230 minutes) and slowly paced films, that is a chore
to stay tuned into. One deserves to get a C in audience 101, for just
remaining awake while watching it. It doesn't help that the characters
are not appealing and do not draw us into their story. The thing here is
history as mixed in with the loose telling of Aeschylus' Oresteia
tragedies-- characters are even named Orestes, Electra, and
Chrysothemis. It's lesson in modern Greek history goes from 1936-1952,
as a travelling actor troupe performs a single folk play, Golfo the
Shepherdess, in different towns all over Greece. We see them in towns
that appear to be shabby and depressing, as the years keep changing, as
does the political climate. The times are torn with Nazis, WW11, Axis
Occupation, civil war (between the Right and Left wings), British
Occupation, and the impending election of Marshal Papagos, representing
a military monarchist regime. He is the one who defeated the Left-Wing
during the civil war. Things certainly look glum; the only cheer comes
from the actors, as they are transported through the far-out regions of
Greece and sing their rhythmic songs of freedom, love, and sadness with
a dignity and verve that enraptures the film in a very moving mood. You
can feel the pulse of the times through the music and realize that big
events are happening to the people of Greece.</P>
<P>The film assumes a lot for a foreign audience viewing it, that they
would be knowledgable about Greek political happenings and of the Greek
tragedies and of its history. The modern Greek history of betrayal,
revenge, and redemption are both the subtle and underlying themes of the
story, as seen through the eyes of the weary acting troupe. The film
begins in 1952, in the town of Aegion, where the acting troupe visited
last in 1939. The actors get caught up in the political manifestations
themselves, as the film traces what happened to the troupe in the past;
the wife of  the troupe's leader takes a Fascist lover and has a bastard
child, while the husband is a leftist and goes off to fight in the war.
Their son Orestes is being buried in 1952, after he became a rebel
soldier who died in prison. In the most moving scene of the film, the
actors bury him and start applauding him for the life he lived as he is
buried; it is as if they were saying, what a performance you gave in
life.</P>
<P>Most of the film was unfortunately not as stimulating and was too trying
a task to follow in all its different kind of historical rejoinders,
even though this is a worthy film, visually bringing real life into
focus, in a way that is unique and psychologically absorbing. There is
no doubt about it, this is a Theo Angelopoulos film, not relying on
cohesiveness of plot or dialogue to tell its story for the record of
history. His camera moves around for many different and enticing angle
shots but his takes go on forever, touching every little gesture and
staying with them for minutes at a time without any action taking place,
making the film a very difficult watch for most non-Greeks.</P>
<P>The highly stylized scene in a restaurant-bar, best caught the feelings
of the two opposing sides in the civil war and of those who just tried
to remain neutral. The leftist were unarmed, seemed jovial, and danced
with their women; while the rightist all wore their hats with the brim
covering their eyes and danced with the men, and fired their guns in the
air. They were the menacing winners. The neutrals just tried to please
those in charge at the time.</P>
<P>Theo Angelopoulos is a great filmmaker, but this first feature of his to
achieve international recognition is not a great film as much as it is a
vital telling about political intrigue. It is a film that is relevant; a
good peek at modern Greece and how it is politically divided. It is a
chance to see how overreaching and meddling the British and the
Americans are seen by the Greek left. It is, also, the story of the
Communist's failure to gain control of the country, and the implications
there are for a state that stays in power by suppressing its people. My
hat is off to anyone who can say they were enthralled with this entire
film, not the pieces of it here and there like I was.</P>
