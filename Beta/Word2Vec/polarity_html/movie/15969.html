<P>With the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the
news lately, what with that whole Clinton thing going on (you know, 100
million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh,
please, government, waste my taxes just a bit more, would you?), it's
about time Tony Scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an
important if not slightly ignorant social statement.  With this and
"Crimson Tide," he's created two successfully chilly films that are
interesting, exciting, even pretty smart, but never totally riveting as
cinema, and the problem I think with each of these films is that each
film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying, and
too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart.
That film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether
or not to follow rules or question them, and was appropriately scary and
all, but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant.</P>
<P>"Enemy of the State" is the same way: it's engrossing for its entire
running time, and it's scary the way that it shows a man's decent into
kafkaism, but it's too technical.  It's too cold and not as fascinating
or exciting as it could be.  It casts Will Smith, one of the better big
budget leading men in movies these days because he's charming and witty
and never uninteresting, and hopes that his charisma can make up for his
character not being well developed enough to really be a person.  I hate
to do this, but last year's film "The Game" got it damn perfect: it
casts Michael Douglas as a deeply flawed human being, a man who is cold
and has cut off everyone from his life, and then pulls everything he
thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what
happened.  The result was not only a film that was exciting and
chilling, but also the best mindfuck of the entire year.  Not that I
want every kafkaesque film to be "The Game" (this year's "The Spanish
Prisoner" succeeds with less thrills and chills), but it should be an
example of what works and what doesn't.</P>
<P>Will Smith's character is, frankly, too perfect, at least too movie
perfect.  He had an affair with another woman (Lisa Bonet, ha ha), but
his relationship with his wife (Regina King) is basically fine
regardless.  He has a kid, and he's raking in money as a lawyer, albeit
a very good and reasonably moral one.  So he generally doesn't have any
real problems as a human being, and is therefore boring...except that he
is played by Will Smith, who embodies him with about as much Will Smith
charm as he can without entering "ID4"/"Men in Black" territory.  He's a
good dramatic actor (just see the first half hour of "Six Degrees of
Separation" for proof of this, not that he isn't great the whole time),
and here, he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any
real strain on his character, which makes the film lack any real deep
interesting qualities.</P>
<P>Smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination
of a Senator opposed to a government law that would create world
surveillance, extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world, under
the pretense that it would make crime easier to control, when he is
passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party (a nature
observer played by, uh, Jason Lee).  The government wants the disk, and
is prepared to destroy his life to get it.  As Smith's plight is
dramatized, we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him,
sitting in vans disguised as other businesses, staring at computers and
pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet.  These guys (played by
Jack Black, Jamie Kennedy, and Seth Green) are the most interesting part
of this film because they're, well, fascinating: they're doing their
jobs, which are evil, but the film doesn't view them as such, and they
almost become our friends.  We like these guys for the sole reason that
the film doesn't automatically judge them as the villains.  They're also
scary because we get the idea that they're not fully aware of the impact
their jobs have on the world.  It's as if they're obsessed with their
jobs, not because they're evil, but because, hey, it's a fun job, and no
one else can do it like them.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, this also backfires a bit on the film: instead of being
the flashlight in the darkened room that "The Game" was, you see
everything, and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is
going on.  Sure, you're chilled, but you're not exacty freaked out by
what's going on.  But what do you expect from Tony Scott, the man who
never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked.  He's a not-bad
director because, hell, he is always interesting to watch (if not
occasionally moronic - exhibit A: "Days of Thunder"), but the reason
he's not great is because he's too technical and calculated.  His shots
are perfectly executed, and leave nothing to the imagination, and
they're always making sure you're paying attention.  This is incredibly
annoying, and it reduces "Enemy of the State" to a mechanical mishmash
of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths, but
still manage to entertain without any real problems.</P>
<P>Despite never actually becoming great, it's never actually boring and
it's always intriguing.  Watching the government set-up Smith is
endlessly fascinating, and since we care about Smith's likeable
protagonist, we are set-up for a good two hours worth of Tom
Clancy-esque entertainment.  Add the best big cast this side of the
annual Woody Allen film (everyone from Gabriel Byrne to Dan Butler pop
up for cameos), and you've got a good old fashioned escapist drama which
does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually
question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow Will
Smith's plight without a minute's worth of boredom.</P>
