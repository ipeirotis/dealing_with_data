<PRE>Mystery, Alaska
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1999 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*1/2 (out of 4) The previews for the movie are pretty good. They show a
little plot, all the characters, and the emotional highlights, all
spliced together to give a general impression of the script.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes.</P>
<P>The residents of Mystery love hockey. Mystery and hockey go together
like Texas and high school football. The townsfolk love hockey so much
that they even acquit a player who's guilty of shooting another man
(yes, that's one of the movie's jokes.) Every Saturday, the best players
pair off for a game, and the whole town comes to watch. </P>
<P>The town's prodigal son Charlie (Hank Azaria) wrote an article on the
weekly game for Sports Illustrated. Mystery's national fame has the town
abuzz. A week later, Charlie actually shows up in person, and he brings
with him an offer from the NHL. The New York Rangers will come to
Mystery to play the locals.</P>
<P>The Mysterians see this as both good and bad. On the one hand, they'd
love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition. On the other
hand, they don't want to turn up as the butt of Leno and Letterman
jokes.</P>
<P>The movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the
proposition. </P>
<P>Biebe (Russell Crowe) has just been retired from the team and is asked
to coach the boys, including his new replacement. He's already
resentful, and to top it off Charlie has been making eyes at his wife.
Crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film, so he's just kind
of stuck with constantly brooding.</P>
<P>Charlie, meanwhile, is resentful of having born in a town where hockey
is the only measure of a man's worth. His "gift" of the feature story,
and of the New York Rangers, was his way of compensating for not being a
better skater. He hoped it would earn him some respect and merit, but
the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him.</P>
<P>Burt Reynolds could have been interesting as Walter, the judge whose
courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans. Walter actually
has some experience with collegiate hockey, but he actively tries to put
it behind him. He wants his son to take the game more seriously, but he
wants his community to just get over it. Reynolds could have been good,
but sloppy writing and/or editing keep Walter in the corner, and so
Reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together.</P>
<P>One character actually was interesting. Biebe's wife (Mary McCormack),
like the judge, understood that there was more to life than hockey. But
unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community. She
chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open. Her unique
insight is verbalized once, and it lasts only a scene before it is gone,
but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom.</P>
<P>MYSTERTY, ALASKA follows a handful of other characters, but none are
well developed or worth mentioning.</P>
<P>The biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to
the story, no underlying thing that the movie is really ABOUT. Instead,
Roach and screenwriters David E. Kelley and Sean O'Byrne try to cram the
entire human condition into this sports comedy. They try to make you
laugh and cry, to feel outrage and pride. They present the framing and
cadence for jokes, but there's nothing truly funny. They show
appropriately staged scenes of sadness, but they give you nothing to be
really sad about. As columnist Molly Ivins would say, it's all hat, no
cattle.</P>
<P>The perfect opportunity arises for Roach to say what this movie is
really about. There is a funeral scene, played with appropriate gravity
and somber music. It is a chance for the characters to reflect on their
lives and decide what's truly important. Russell Crowe steps forward to
speak, about to spell out the movie's metaphor for us. He says that what
really matters in life is "community...." Then adds "and hockey." I
guess these Mysterians really are as shallow as they appear.</P>
<P>Only mildly bad, Mystery, Alaska probably deserves 2 stars. I even
laughed out loud, genuine laughs in places. But I docked it an extra
half star when Mike Myers, a friend of Roach, turned up in a role that
didn't suit him. Myers is a comic character actor. He puts on masks,
becomes an outrageous caricature, and is funny. He's great as Austin
Powers, Dr. Evil, or any of his Scottish characters. </P>
<P>Nobody else in MYSTERTY, ALASKA is a comic caricature. All the other
people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles. For
Roach to bring in Myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt
toward the rest of his cast, toward his audience, and indeed toward the
film itself. It's an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not
worth taking seriously.</P>
<PRE>I recommend you take his word for it.</PRE>
