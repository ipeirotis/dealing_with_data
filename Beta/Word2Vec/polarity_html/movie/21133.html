<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a Steven Spielberg DreamWorks project film. Sam Mendes was
personally hired by the big boss, as he makes his feature film
directorial debut with American Beauty. He previously directed Arthur
Schnitzler's play "The Blue Room" on Broadway, starring Nicole Kidman,
and he also directed the award-winning London production of "The Rise
and Fall of Little Voice."</P>
<P>Mendes turns his attention here to the Anywhere in America, suburbs, a
favorite place for sitcoms, where the middle-class are always ripe for
social criticism. In this case, the film hones in on two dysfunctional
suburban families living next to each other, both with disturbing sexual
problems that keep each family from enjoying the "good life" they should
be having, even if they live in a good neighborhood with tree-lined
streets and have beautiful houses; but, there is something wrong with
them: they are living in hate.</P>
<P>In the first house, are the Burnhams: Lester (Kevin Spacey) is a
repressed middle-aged man. Carolyn (Annette Bening), is Lester's frigid
and enterprising Realtor wife, who is more interested in the material
things of life and in her hobby of growing garden roses, than she is in
having a warm relationship with her husband, whom she looks down upon.
Their teenage daughter Jane (Thora), finds that she can't communicate
with either parent, thinking that her dad is a pathetic loser and her
mother is an uncaring phony. Her unattentive folks don't even realize
what is eating at her, that she wants an unneeded breast enlargement,
and that she lacks self-esteem, thinking of herself as being
unattractive.</P>
<P>The Fitts' are the new neighbors of the Burnhams and the second
dysfunctional family featured. They are made up of the rigid, retired
marine corps colonel (Chris Cooper), who thinks the world should conform
to military-like rules; his gloomy robot-like wife (Janney), who is in
denial about her miserable life; and their misfit 18-year-old son, Ricky
(Wes Bentley), who was caught by his dad smoking dope and placed in a
mental institution by him after being kicked out of a military school
for trying to kill another student. The father tests his son every few
months for drugs by taking a sample of his urine.</P>
<P>The story centers around three sudden changes that happen to Lester, as
Lester via a voiceover from the other world, tells us he died within the
year of this story taking place. He is, at first, seen as a bland,
white-collar working stiff who feels in the doldrums about the emptiness
of his life and has what may be loosely termed, a spiritual reawakening,
when the frustration of his unsatisfying job as an editor for the last
14-years at an advertising publication firm reaches a critical point,
and before he gets the ax, he forces by bribery his snotty young boss
Brad (Del Sherman) to pay him a year's salary for severence pay, as he
also gets to tell him to go f*ck himself. Secondly, Ricky sells him some
top-notch grass and he starts listening to some old Dylan recordings as
he gets stoned, instead of having to listen to the Lawrence Welk type of
music his wife likes to put on when they're dining. And thirdly, his
antagonistic daughter Jane (Thora), reluctantly introduces him to her
nubile high school cheerleader friend, Angela (Mena), at a basketball
game he is dragged to by his wife. He falls in love with Angela
instantly and has her in his erotic dreams- where rose petals are seen
coming out from her cheerleader's sweater. Previously, his only pleasure
in life, was in jerking off once a day. Angela is a sexual tease, who
talks like a Valley girl, fearful of being thought of as ordinary, only
dreaming of becoming a super model. She enjoys having Jane's father
staring at her, as she tells the embarrassed Jane, that he's cute, and
if he worked out and got muscles she would go to bed with him. Lester
overhears this on the night Angela sleeps over in their house and
immediately starts a physical training program to pull in his gut and
become muscular.</P>
<P>Lester is rejuvenated by his dream girl, loses his inhibitions as he
starts to smoke pot regularly, and tries to turn back the clock to his
youth by becoming a hamburger flipper in a fast-food place, recalling
how happy he once was when working at a job without responsibilities and
getting laid and stoned all the time.</P>
<P>The story now follows Carolyn, who is having an affair with someone she
idolizes, her competitor, the king of the local real estate market,
Buddy `The King' Kane (Peter Gallagher), a person more driven for
success and more wrapped up in himself than she is. She also learns to
shoot a gun, at the suggestion of her lover, as a way to release her
pent-up tension. Kane is one of those guys who live by the slogans from
their motivational tapes, where there is a saying to get them through
anything in life.</P>
<P>The story then centers on Ricky and Jane, as she takes a chance and gets
to know the voyeur who, at first, bothered her by constantly videoing
her. But she surprisingly finds warmth in her relationship with this
freak. He can see the beauty in the simple things of life and makes no
pretense of trying to fit into suburbia, like she was trying to do.
Ricky seems to be weirdly obsessed with beauty and death, and has become
a compulsive voyeur to escape from the harsh realities of his life.
Somehow, he has developed a confidence in himself, just like one that
Lester will develop as his life physically and emotionally changes, as
these two become friends, and along with Jane become the heroes of the
story, or at least, these are the flawed characters who are found to be
worthy of being saved from their shallow lives.</P>
<P>The film builds to a mystery conclusion, where the characters are forced
to come together to decide their fate, to find out if they are worthy of
being redeemed.</P>
<P>Inviting Jane to see the most beautiful thing he has ever videotaped,
Ricky shows her the image of an empty plastic bag swirling in the wind
on a blustery day. He then tells her that he finds beauty in such
ordinary things and is constantly amazed that there is beauty behind
every image he uncovers. Ricky and Lester will share this same vision of
life, as this becomes the film's mantra, reinforced several times
throughout the film: that redemption can be gotten through love. This
mantra will also be repeated at the end of the film, before the credits
are shown. The viewer is told by Lester, from the other world: that if
you don't share the film's piercing vision of what really matters,
someday you will. So forgiveness for these flawed characters is in
order, as well as forgiveness for those who try to repress them because
they are bitter, having found no love in their own lives. The lesson to
be learnt is, that love is the only thing that can't be completely taken
away from people; it remains behind everything that is.</P>
<P>This Alan Ball script, his debut assignment in films, is bristling with
comedy and hard lessons to learn about life for these unfulfilled
characters. If normalcy is the thing that the families are striving for,
even if that is quickly seen as a sham, then what the director
brilliantly does, is shoot down any hope for his characters ever being
normal, even those who might think that they are normal. So what are
they striving for, if not normalcy? Perhaps, in the end, we see that
they are after love but have lost the way in their long trip through
life, and are now trying to get back on track, each in their own
convoluted way, as only the colonel can't because of his bad karma and
his wife can't because she just doesn't have the energy to even try.</P>
<P>What results is a darkly satirical story that was equisitively directed.
It makes sound points about the fallacy of normalcy and the necessity of
nonconformity, and that its barbs about suburbia are on target. But the
film succeeds, and in some regards is brilliant, not because some of the
flawed characters see the light of day at last and might possibly
reform, but because the acting was grand by everyone, and Spacey was
more than grand, his was a tour-de-force performance. He has the ability
to squeeze humor out of a stone and turn frightening at the drop of a
dish. He's that good of an actor to carry this film, even as he is
supported by a terrific cast, he still stands out as the star. Bening is
his perfect foil, with a special flare for comedy, but still, through no
fault of hers, is a cardboard villain, with no room to grow. Bentley, a
virtual newcomer to films, his prior experience being a few lines in
Beloved, gives a strong performance as a very complex teen, one who can
get the upper hand even as he is being punched around by his father,
while pretending to his father that he believes his disciplinary methods
are for his own good. Mena is in an exploitive role, one that calls for
an obligatory porn shot of her breasts; but she is delicious and
appealing, and brings more to the part than can be expected, even crying
out for sympathy by the film's end. Thora, a 17-year-old veteran
actress, even at that tender age, played a twisted and sullen figure,
but nevertheless came off as a sympathetic figure, giving a soulful
performance, in a role that reminded many people of one that Christina
Ricci would play, but not necessarily play better. Cooper did a fine job
as a homophobic and a closet homosexual, but his role as a villain was
also too one-dimensional to give his character a more introspective edge
to it, even if his performance was first-class.</P>
<P>So why did I just like the film very much but not love it? I think it is
because, as entertaining as this film was, something just didn't smell
right about these roses; everything discovered seemed to be only
something that is surface; there was no real revolution of character
going on. The characters were looking outwardly for help, none of them
had a grip on their inward nature, which is a good place to start when
looking for beauty. I think there were too many contradictions in the
lives of Lester, Ricky, and Jane to believe that they found what they
were looking for, even if, the film implies that is just what they did
do.</P>
<P>What goes for "real" change of character in this film (it is hard to
tell if the film means it to be a parody or not), can only be termed as
trivial changes, as seen by the following examples: Lester by working at
a Mr. Smileys fast food place after quitting his so called "real" job,
is not really going through an internal change, he is merely escaping
from life by going through a temporary childhood fantasy. The satire
also became mean-spirited, at this point, as I took exception to some of
the jokes plied from these scenes, as they seemed to be mocking those
who take such jobs, by implying those jobs are just for losers. Carolyn,
by screwing her way to liberation, has not found a means to love, but,
more than likely, she has only found a means to continue her path of
selfish pleasure. Ricky, by cowtailing to his father's persecution and
by becoming a successful drug dealer, has not found a healthy way to
handle an abnormal father-son relationship. His character was actually
the most interesting one in the film, since he saw things the others
couldn't see, yet I suspect there is something deeply wrong with a
teenager who has to find love by being a voyeur and material success by
being a drug dealer, no matter how it is explained away. Jane, by
running away from home with Ricky, is not doing what is necessarily a
good thing for a naive high school girl to do.</P>
<P>When you think about what the film had to say and distance yourself from
all the fine performances and the splendid cinematography that the
70-ish-year-old master of his craft, Conrad L. Hall, gave us, who is an
expert on lighting techniques, and you step away from the sharp wit
found in Alan Ball's dazzling script-- what you are left wondering
about, is how shallow it all is, in a film that has a bite to its satire
but not enough of a bite to dig into the characters other than what is
seen on the surface. In the end, this is primarily a Hollywood type of
film and all the hype about how daring and nonconventional this film is,
should be dismissed as nothing but hype. Yet it is a captivating film,
one that had its moments of grandeur, and all-in-all, I really was
absorbed in it, and somehow liked the film more than I probably should
have.</P>
