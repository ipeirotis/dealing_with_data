<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A fine sequel to the 1956 "The Curse of Frankenstein." It is set in
1860, where Baron Von Frankenstein is sentenced to die as a murderer,
accused of creating a monster killer. But he escapes the guillotine. It
is arranged by payment to have the priest who gave the Baron his last
rites executed in place of him, by the executioner and his hunchbacked
assistant (Oscar Quitak). Frankenstein then flees to Carlsbruck, another
central European town. Peter Cushing is excellent as Dr. Victor Stein,
the new name he takes after escaping the execution.</P>
<P>After being in the new town for three years, Dr. Stein has a successful
practice established among the rich hypochondriacs and also works with
the poor in a charity hospital. He upsets the other doctors in town by
not joining their medical council and that he has taken away many of
their patients.</P>
<P>Dr. Hans Kleve (Matthews) is new in town and immediately recognizes
Frankenstein. He blackmails Dr. Stein into accepting him as an assistant
in payment for his silence. It is his hope to learn from Dr. Stein his
secrets and to become his disciple, he does this since he considers him
the most learned doctor in Europe.</P>
<P>Most of the film takes place in the tacky hospital setting, where the
poor are operated on for their body parts, which Dr. Stein uses to build
another monster. This time he will build a perfect man and place a live
brain in him. The brain will be Karl's, he is the one who agreed to help
Dr. Stein escape, with the promise he would operate on him and give him
a new body. He mentions that he is tired of having everybody stare at
his hunchback and hooked hand.</P>
<P>A very attractive nurse Margaret Conrad (Eunice) volunteers to help in
the charity hospital, and when she's on the ward, the nosy janitor
(Woodbridge) tells her that he knows a lot of secrets around here and
gets her curious about a mysterious patient. He gives her the master key
to a room hidden out of sight where Karl, now played by Michael Gwynn,
is recovering from the operation that transferred his brain into all the
body parts collected in the hospital and was then created into a person.
Dr. Stein has him strapped to the bed as a precaution that he doesn't
leave the hospital too soon, as his brain needs more time to adjust to
the operation. There is some additional hokum about the new person
becoming a cannibal, if his brain does not heal properly after the
operation. When Karl questions Hans what will happen to him next, and is
told that Dr. Stein wants to get revenge on the medical profession that
rejected his genius and will display the new Karl and the old one to all
the medical groups, and thereby hopes to get recognition at last as the
greatest doctor in the world, Karl becomes unhappy with this, mentioning
he has been stared at all his life. He thereby gets Margaret to loosen
the straps and escapes. He goes to the lab and burns his old body in the
furnace, but a crude night watchman (George Woodbridge) comes into the
cellar and beats him up, which turns him back into a monster, as he
strangles him.</P>
<P>Karl then goes on the loose, killing a woman he runs into and then
crashing through the window to enter a society ball, and calling out to
Frankenstein for help while he is looking at Dr. Stein. The police will
take care of him offscreen. The ending in the hospital is smartly done,
as Dr. Stein meets up with the wrath of the patients who stomp him to
death. But there is another body he created waiting for him in the lab
and Hans has learned enough from the master to transplant Frankenstein's
still living brain into the new body. He is next seen as Dr. Franck in
London, with presumably another successful practice on the way and the
same old diabolical plans.</P>
<P>These climactic scenes suggest the ambivalent nature of the cruel and
egomaniacal Frankenstein who becomes a martyr for genius and
inspiration, someone fighting the repressive forces of the elite society
who wish to exploit the people and keep everything mediocre. This theme
is what sustains the B- film with a deeper meaning to the Frankenstein
myth and keeps him from being a one-dimensional villain. But, overall,
there was a staid quality about the film that kept it from being as
gripping as it could have been. Needless to say, the film was hardly
believable, as everything about it was disputable. Yet it was
entertaining and the cast did a good job, all things considered.</P>
