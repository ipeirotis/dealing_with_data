<P>     Love is supposed to be one of the most wonderful things known to 
humanity, and Hollywood has produced countless pictures that place it on 
the highest pedestal.  But there is another kind of love -- a darker, 
uglier sort that rarely reaches the screen because the public, it is 
deemed, finds it too unpleasant.  So, while most films are content to 
explore the lighter, romantic side of love, WASHINGTON SQUARE takes a 
cold, hard look at the painful, destructive aspect of the same emotion.</P>
<P>     Two years ago, motion pictures enjoyed a flirtation with Jane 
Austen, adapting no less than four of her novels into major motion 
pictures and/or television mini-series.  Last year, it was Shakespeare's 
turn.  Now, in 1997, the classic author du jour appears to be Henry 
James.  Within a twelve-month period, three of his novels have been 
adapted for the screen (PORTRAIT OF A LADY, WASHINGTON SQUARE, THE WINGS 
OF THE DOVE).  Curiously, however, James' best-known works, THE TURN OF 
THE SCREW and THE GOLDEN BOWL, have not received new treatments, which 
leaves the door wide open for further exploration in the near future.</P>
<P>     WASHINGTON SQUARE is actually the second film to be made from the 
James novel of the same name.  The first, 1949's THE HEIRESS (directed 
by William Wyler and starring Olivia De Havilland, who won an Oscar for 
her role), was based on a stage play version of the book that eliminated 
many of the more subtle aspects of James' text.  For this interpretation 
of WASHINGTON SQUARE, director Agnieszka Holland and screenwriter Carol 
Doyle have returned to James' original story and created a quiet, 
thoughtful examination of the author's favorite theme:  the difficulty 
of balancing love and money, and the pernicious influence of the latter 
upon the former.</P>
<P>     As WASHINGTON SQUARE opens, we are greeted with a tragic scene:  a 
young woman lying dead in the aftermath of childbirth.  Her husband, 
Austin Sloper (Albert Finney), barely looks at his newborn daughter, 
Catherine, as she is presented to him.  Flash-forward several years.  
Catherine, an awkward adolescent, is shown trying to please her father 
on his birthday.  But, despite her best efforts, everything goes wrong, 
and she is forced to flee from his party in embarrassment.  When we next 
meet Catherine (now played by Jennifer Jason Leigh), she is an adult, 
but is still slavishly trying to win her father's adoration.  However, 
in his characteristically brusque manner, he finds fault with nearly 
everything she does.</P>
<P>     The domestic tranquillity of the Sloper household changes 
dramatically on the day that Catherine meets Morris Townsend (Ben 
Chaplin), an adventurer and wanderer who has just returned to America 
from abroad.  Catherine falls in love with him, and, although he 
apparently returns her feelings, Austin is suspicious of his motives.  
Morris is penniless and Catherine is wealthy, and all Austin sees in the 
young man is a fortune hunter.  He refuses to sanction a marriage and 
indicates that if Catherine defies him, he will disown her.  </P>
<P>     The crux of Catherine's dilemma isn't whether to surrender money 
for love -- that would be no choice, since physical pampering is largely 
unimportant to her.  Instead, she must struggle with the consequences of 
giving up her father's love for her suitor's.  Initially, she is 
unwilling (and perhaps unable) to go against her father's wishes.  The 
real meat of WASHINGTON SQUARE focuses on Catherine's growth as an 
individual to the point where she can see that her father's feelings for 
her are not as pure as she once believed them to be.  Jennifer Jason 
Leigh manages to capture the essence of Catherine by avoiding 
histrionics, finding the core of innocence that forms Catherine's 
center, and showing the inner strength that blossoms from it.</P>
<P>     Austin could easily have become a black-and-white villain, but 
Finney's performance defies the audience's desire to label him as such.  
While many of Austin's actions are reprehensible, we understand that he 
is not just motivated by selfishness.  There is a great wellspring of 
pain in his life -- a void left by the absence of a beloved wife whose 
death he blames on his daughter.  And, although in one sense he resents 
Catherine, it is also clear that, in his own way, he loves her as well.  
Finney handles the complex motivations of his character expertly, 
creating a fascinating antagonist.</P>
<P>     The third major character is the most ambiguous.  WASHINGTON SQUARE 
keeps us guessing about Morris' real motivations.  Is he truly in love 
with Catherine because she feeds his vanity and makes him feel "like the 
most important thing in the world"?  Or is he, as Austin suspects, after 
her money, and an easy path to a pampered life?  While Ben Chaplin's 
performance is not the equal of Leigh's or Finney's, he is solid enough 
not to give away the truth about Morris until the script reveals it.</P>
<P>     Lest WASHINGTON SQUARE seem too serious and downbeat, there's 
always the character of Aunt Livinia (Maggie Smith) on hand to provide 
comic relief.  Austin's sister, who has served as Catherine's surrogate 
mother, delivers many of the film's most witty lines, and her presence 
single-handedly keeps the tone gentler than one might otherwise expect.  
In part because of her, WASHINGTON SQUARE is considerably lighter than 
the other currently-available (and similarly-themed) James adaptation, 
THE WINGS OF THE DOVE.</P>
<P>     The best thing about WASHINGTON SQUARE is that it draws us into the 
world of the characters and challenges us to understand them and 
question their views and motivations.  The film is emotionally effective 
without going overboard.  Director Agnieszka Holland (whose previous 
efforts include EUROPA EUROPA and OLIVIER OLIVIER) opts to avoid the 
temptation of reducing WASHINGTON SQUARE to the level of a costume 
melodrama.  Her careful, modulated handling of the material makes this 
resemble Merchant-Ivory's better work (like THE REMAINS OF THE DAY).  
WASHINGTON SQUARE is faithful representation of James' text, and a 
moving and satisfying portrait of one woman's struggle for independence 
in a society where everything is defined by love, money, or both.</P>
