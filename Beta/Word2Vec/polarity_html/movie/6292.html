<PRE>                                THE FUNERAL
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     With the Mafia genre having run its course, director Abel Ferrara
attempts to revive it with a bit of revisionist history.  Everyone
knows what happens in mobster films.  Fast tempered guys get angry and
shoot the competition.  No longer.</P>
<P>     In Ferrara's THE FUNERAL, the gangsters are stoics.  When problems
arise, they seek out the meditative environment of a dark room so they
can silently brood.  From when-in-doubt-shoot, we have gone to
let's-ponder.  Don't worry, you will not be disappointed.  After
seeking and not finding inner peace, the crooks do return to kill their
prey in suitably gory fashion.  To add a twist, the gangsters' business
is full of political overtones with a range from Republicans to
Communists.</P>
<P>     Although you would swear that THE FUNERAL was by a Swedish
director, Ferrara is actually the one who gave the world the extremely
violent, but highly regarded BAD LIEUTENANT and my personal favorite of
his, the 1993 remake of BODY SNATCHERS.  The only way I can figure it
is that Ferrara must have spent a lot time recently watching old Ingmar
Bergman films.  Consider THE FUNERAL his homage to the great master.</P>
<P>     Set in New York in the labor unrest of the 30s, THE FUNERAL starts
after the funeral of one of the three Tempio brothers.  Communist
sympathizer Johnny Tempio (Vincent Gallo) has died and all of his
relatives have come to mourn.  Unstable brother Chez (Chris Penn) does
not take his brother's death well and wants to know who did it.
Unpredictable brother Ray (Christopher Walken) is quiet and morose.
The film then switches to the past and brings the viewer back up to and
past the funeral.</P>
<P>     Although it is a color film, its color palette contains mainly
shades of black.  The cinematography by Ken Kelsch is dark and gloomy.
Everything is in shadows.  The sets by Charles Lagola are equally
somber with dark woods and sleek, long black automobiles.  Joe Delia's
music is serious and melancholic with solo violins.</P>
<P>     "It is only a criminal that can lead our country," tells the union
rabble-rouser (Edie Falco) under his Communist party banner.  (I will
reject making any reference here to our current political landscape.)
Johnny is impressed and falls under the orator's spell.</P>
<P>     Soon the brothers have cut a deal with the union bosses since the
money is good.  When another mobster, Gaspare Spoglia (Benicio Del
Toro), shows up with the businessman being picketed by the unions they
are helping, they switch sides.  After a pseudo-intellectual discussion
of the economic implication of strikes, Ray says learnedly, "We
understand the problems of the economy also."  The businessman offers
more cash than the unions so Ray follows the money.</P>
<P>     The show is full of film references.  Johnny tells his friend
that, "I would say life is pretty pointless, wouldn't you, without the
movies?"  Later they come out of a theater where the next film will be
KISS KISS BANG BANG.  This is an accolade to the great film critic
Pauline Kael and her famous quote "The words KISS KISS BANG BANG, which
I saw on an Italian movie poster, are perhaps the briefest statement
imaginable of the basic appeal of movies.  This appeal is what attracts
us, and ultimately what makes us despair when we begin to understand
how seldom movies are more than this."</P>
<P>     The acting is interesting even if full of stereotypes.  Del Toro
is ultrasmooth and confident.  Walken is, well, Walken.  Gallo is slimy
and disrespectful.  The most complex and complete performance is given
by Penn.  His is the only one that is believable.  It is easy to miss
much of Nicholas St. John's sparse script due to the tendency of the
actors to whisper and mumble.</P>
<P>     In contrast to the men's evil, their women are shown as
downtrodden angels.  "Aren't you ashamed of yourself," inquires Ray's
wife Jean (Annabella Sciorra).  But he explains his actions away with,
"I'm not ashamed of nothing.  I didn't make the world."  Later Jean
tells Chez's wife Clara (Isabella Rossellini) that "They're criminals,
and there's absolutely nothing romantic about it."</P>
<P>     I love the part of the press kit discussing Ferrara: "One of the
most idiosyncratic filmmakers of our time, Ferrar's films combine high
art and low down sleaze to create an unflinching, in-your-face
depiction of the moral mayhem of modern life."  This is an apt
description of BAD LIEUTENANT, but is off the mark for THE FUNERAL.
THE FUNERAL is a slow moving and cerebral film interrupted briefly for
the obligatory violent sequences.  Its style does have a certain
attraction and the acting is good.  Whether that is sufficient to
compel audiences to see it remains problematic.</P>
<P>     THE FUNERAL runs 1:38.  It is rated R for nudity, explicit sex,
strong language, and periodic, realistic, but not gratuitous violence.
If teenagers go, they should be mature.  The show is a tough call for
me since as much as I admire the risk taking, there is just not enough
there for me to be able to recommend it.  It gets ** in my book.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
