<P>     It doesn't take a genius to presume that TWIN TOWN is this year's 
attempt by a distributor to reap the market primed by last year's 
TRAINSPOTTING (in fact, that film's creative team of Danny Boyle and 
Andrew MacDonald exec-produced this movie).  The feature debut of 
director Kevin Allen is exceptionally profane, frequently violent, and 
occasionally grotesque, which all adds up to a reasonably high "hipness" 
quotient in a genre where Quentin Tarantino is king.  Plus, TWIN TOWN 
has the same kind of nearly-incomprehensible accents (Welsh instead of 
Scottish here) that caused Miramax to panic and try some selective (and 
ineffective) dubbing of the TRAINSPOTTING audio tracks.  Ultimately, 
however, like so many wannabes, TWIN TOWN lacks several key ingredients 
that its predecessor possessed -- notably style, originality, and depth.</P>
<P>     The film starts out promisingly enough, with a self-mocking 
prologue in which the Lewis brothers (who aren't really twins, but just 
act like it), Julian and Jeremy (played by real-life siblings Llyr Evans 
and Rhys Ifans), discuss the likelihood that TWIN TOWN will be well-
received in America.  Cue the opening credits.  Unfortunately, the 
movie's satirical sophistication never again approaches this level.  The 
world we're plunged into is gray and flat, and Allen's presentation of 
it is too-often uninspired.  Outlandishness for its own sake isn't 
interesting, just as a film's status as a "black comedy" doesn't excuse 
its multitude of flaws.  TRAINSPOTTING was an explosion of creative 
edginess; TWIN TOWN rarely provokes anything more enthusiastic than a 
yawn.</P>
<P>     Allen's movie, which takes place in Swansea, Wales (called, 
appropriately enough, "the graveyard of ambition" by Dylan Thomas), 
introduces us to a cast of characters who could have been lifted out of 
a bad MONTY PYTHON sketch (one of those where you wonder how such a 
talented troupe could come up with something so unfunny).  In spite of 
their car-stealing hobby, glue-sniffing habits, and violent tendencies, 
the de facto protagonists, Julian and Jeremy, are easily the two most 
dreary people that we meet (the director has aptly described them as 
intentionally two-dimensional).  Equally outlandish, but only slightly 
more intriguing, are their mother (Di Botcher), their father (Huw 
Ceredig), and their trash-talking, prostitute sister (Rachel Scorgie).  
A couple of crooked cops, Greyo and Terry (Dorien Thomas and Dougray 
Scott), are always on the lookout for a way to make some quick cash, 
even if it involves drug-dealing and frame-ups.  Terry is actually 
working for Bryn Cartwright (William Thomas), the closest thing Swansea 
has to a crime lord.  Also thrown into the mix are Cartwright's 
daughter, Bonny (Jenny Evans), and a self-proclaimed Karaoke King (Brian 
Hibbard).</P>
<P>     Things get underway when the twins' father breaks a leg falling off 
a ladder doing a construction job for Cartwright, who refuses to offer 
any kind of compensation.  The incensed boys decide on a childish-but-
repugnant form of revenge, which Cartwright takes very personally.  
Soon, the feud has gotten out of hand, with dogs being beheaded and 
humans blown up.</P>
<P>     TWIN TOWN commits a black comedy cardinal sin by believing that 
it's a lot more incisive and funny than it actually is.  In fact, the 
term "boring" wouldn't be out of place as a descriptor of the endless 
first half.  That's because, at least early on, TWIN TOWN is just about 
a bunch of off-putting, undeveloped characters doing a variety of dodgy 
things.  We've seen it all before; it's time to offer a new twist.  The 
dialogue is passably interesting for only one reason:  it's easily the 
most profane I have ever encountered on screen (there are something like 
500 uses of the "f" word, or one of its permutations).  The plot -- or 
what passes for one -- is pointless and occasionally muddled (especially 
near the beginning).  The good news is that TWIN TOWN gets markedly 
better during its second half.  By that time, however, will anyone care?  </P>
<P>     TWIN TOWN invites comparisons to other movies because it's not 
absorbing enough on its own to grab an audience's attention.  None of 
the characters are of great interest and the acting is of variable 
quality.  The film apparently played well overseas, which is good for 
its financial stability, because it's unlikely to make much of a dent in 
the summer box office on this side of the Atlantic.  For a movie that 
deals with doubles, TWIN TOWN barely has half of what it needs to make 
for compelling viewing.</P>
