<PRE>INTIMACY
A film review by Jeremiah Kipp
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>The uncompromising nudity bared throughout Petrice Chereau's Intimacy
has already garnered much notoriety, but it's in the naked faces of
fearless actors Mark Rylance (Angels & Insects) and Kerry Fox (Welcome
To Sarajevo) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered. 
With sharp, intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity,
Rylance and Fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of
Hollywood idols.  Their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw
honesty, in the acceptance of flesh and messiness.  Less apparent, but
no less remarkable, are the astute observations of behavior revealed
through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance, often without a
single line of dialogue.</P>
<P>Not aiming for the spiritual poetry of In the Realm of the Senses or the
philosophical transgressions of Crash, Chereau keeps his sexual odyssey
firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development.  That
may be the very reason why Intimacy seems unerringly impressive but
never particularly significant on more than a tactile, sensory level. 
The themes of human isolation are barren and obvious, a science project
devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis.  Intimacy does
manage to stand out from lesser portraits of "human interconnectedness"
and Pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers (okay,
kill me).   Shallow though it might sound, it's amazing how much is
filled in through an inspired cast, perceptive camerawork, and
imaginative ways of treating the love scene.  Those ingredients are too
assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake, especially
since they are the substance of the cake itself.</P>
<P>Adapted from a pair of short stories by British novelist Hanif Kureishi,
Intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in London. 
Every Wednesday, Jay (Rylance) and Claire (Fox) meet in his cluttered,
dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their
uninspired lives.  He's been head bartender at a posh restaurant for
over six years.  She's a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance
reveals a similar dissatisfaction.  They're both married, but his
relationship has curdled into an embittered separation.  As the weeks
draw on, Jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover Claire's
personal routines.  In his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she
is, he opens wounds that hadn't existed before by single-handedly
corrupting the fantasy.  If it weren't for a few unnecessary subplots
involving Jay's brother and his bevy of disgruntled co-workers, this
minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of
wish fulfillment.</P>
<P>Chareau's restless camera (once again wielded by superb and
ever-attentive cinematographer Eric Gautier) is less appropriate here
than in his family transit-oriented Those Who Love Me Can Take the
Train.  The scenes that linger are the still ones where Rylance and Fox
separately, pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household
routines.  These are often captured in lingering, unblinking wide shots
that view them stranded amidst their drab workplaces and homes. 
Separation proves haunting in a melancholy series of intercut shots as
Rylance and Fox undress on opposite sides of the room, crawling across
the floor to meet in the center.  Despite being as restless as a fly
during the hyperactive restaurant scenes (all the better to blend in
with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters), you'd be hard pressed to
find a single uninteresting image.  Intimacy takes an interest in its
sordid world of the lower-middle class, with lonely pubs and busy
shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those
spaces, viewing them with sympathy scraped raw.</P>
<P>An evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great Timothy
Spall (the robust scene-stealer of many a Mike Leigh collaboration).  As
Claire's cuckolded husband, this jocular heavyweight plays out his
handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and self-effacing
embarrassment of his imposing bulk.  Bangs in his eyes, his mouth
forming into quizzical pouts and dry smirks, he may seem the fool in his
barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic, gleaming Mark Rylance (whose
Jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble), but Spall
is no one to trifle with.  His overreaching Best Pal demeanor suggests a
mind abuzz with secret passageways of guile, his pointed questions only
naïve if you choose not to read into their crafty insinuations.  In his
unassuming way, Spall's carefully etched interpretation of hostility
buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most
criminally underappreciated performances of the year, but maybe also one
of the best.  He's that good.</P>
