<PRE>                          HIGHLANDER II: THE QUICKENING
                       A film review by Chris Thornborrow
                        Copyright 1991 Chris Thornborrow</PRE>
<P>Plot Summary:
     The year is 2024.  The ozone layer has long since gone and the
earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by Connor
McCleod.  The shield, although saving lives, has made the atmosphere
hot and humid.  Connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up
hope.  On returning from the opera one night Connor is accosted by the
leader of a "terrorist" organisation.  They have tried to find out what
the Company that now runs the shield unit are covering up.  Connor is
then attacked by two assassins sent by Katana from the planet Zeist (like
Zeit--get it?).  They fail and Connor becomes immortal again by
chopping their heads off.  He then brings Ramirez back to life in
Glencoe in Scotland.  Both Ramirez and Connor are rebel leaders back on
Zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment.  Connor now has the
option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found
immortality and fight to find out about the Company and the shield.
Katana meanwhile, fearing Connor would return, sets out himself to kill
the Highlander.</P>
<PRE>Rating :
     2/10 if you liked Highlander
     4/10 if you have never seen it.</PRE>
<P>     Being a fan of Highlander and Mr. Connery, I was in the cinema as
soon as I could to see HIGHLANDER II: THE QUICKENING.  I wish it had
been quicker.  I feel whatever else you can say about a film (bad script
bad music, etc.) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then
nothing much else needs to be said.  The film was short but in my
opinion only twelve minutes or so (the time Mr. Connery is on the screen
for) is worth watching.</P>
<P>     The plot sounds a little ridiculous but I was willing to give it a
chance.  Maybe they could pull it off.  Instead, I find that the
characters have completely changed from those in the first film.  It's as
if they are different people with the same names.  Witness Connor
jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the
attitude of "who wants to live forever, when love must die" gone to?
The love sub-plot *must* have had footage cut out.  The highlander and
Ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before.
Putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away
because of some new power is very annoying.  I still want to know why
Connor's coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal!  We are not given
enough time on Zeist to believe in it, nor are we told why advanced
aliens still use swords to kill.  Why not dynamite or laser saws or just
plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck?  I know the head
needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with
laser rifles first.  To be fair one assassin tried this but he must be
the world's worst shot.  Meanwhile Connor develops Luke-Skywalker-like
powers of laser beam deflection.</P>
<P>     As for "bad guys," we see a rebellion on Zeist, crushed easier
than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on Katana being
obsessed with killing McCleod in case he returns to Zeist.  Two assassins
are sent, presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged
Connor kills them both with no problems.  No more assassins are sent.
Katana, supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill Connor.  Has
he no more assassins?  Has he no better?  Why was the rebellion crushed
so easily then?  Michael Ironside is totally unconvincing (bring back
the Kurgan).  He seems like a cartoon character and really isn't that
evil, just stupid and violent.  We see the Hollywood trick of the chief
nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents.  Yet he
still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to
threaten Connor, or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn't have
been amiss with Larry, Curly and Mo.</P>
<P>     So much for plot and characters.  The music is atrocious.  It is
at best intrusive and at worst annoying.  Bring back Queen.  There was
an audible sigh (of relief?) when Connor played a Queen track in a
juke box.  I believe this at least is to be corrected for the American
release.  </P>
<P>     The acting is at best flat, except for Mr. Connery.  Lambert is 
uninteresting and when he delivered "There can be only one" this time
around it just made me wish there had only been one -- HIGHLANDER.
Michael Ironside is unconvincing; sorry, Michael, I usually like you and
everyone else was incredibly forgetable.</P>
<P>     So why 2/10?  Visually the film is interesting at all times.  It
has a BLADE RUNNER feel to it and some of the special effects are quite
stunning.  Add to this an irrepressible Sean Connery who smiles
throughout the whole film -- or is he smirking to himself?  His lines
and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious
that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey -- *I'd*
have done it for 12 million.  </P>
<P>     Oh, and I agree with a previous reviewer, she *does* look like
Sharon Stone but I believe it is her first film.  Incidentally there is
a line producer credited and I hear rumours of HIGHLANDER III: THE
WIZARD.  </P>
<PRE>     Save your money. It stinks. 
     "There should have been only one."</PRE>
