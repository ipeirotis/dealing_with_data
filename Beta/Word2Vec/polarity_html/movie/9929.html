<P>There's a moment in Schindler's List when a number of jews are trudging
through snow, clean and crisp, dark edges and frost on the ground. One girl
waltzes through, wearing a red dress that stings the eyes. It is probably
the finest moment through out the film. When I first saw it I began to cry,
though I could not say why. This landscape is the setting of many small
moments that add up to one big whole. when one man is shot in the head we
see blood oozing out onto the ground -- so black and murky, its almost
pomegranate red. At another time we follow a young boy as he runs,
searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet -- which
is already occupied. Like so ( Citizen Kane, Fargo, The Godfather, The
Godfather Part II, Greed, ) many of the greatest American films,
Schindler's List plays with the concepts of money, power, and soul. But
this is a movie about a man who does the right thing. Starkly emotional,
and brutally powerful,  Schindler's List strips away everything on the
outset and leaves us ony feelings. The following that it has gained is not
suprising -- this is probably, thus far, the best film of the decade. </P>
<P>Steven Spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker -- his assured hand
churned out both Jurassic Parks, Jaws, the Indiana Jones   films, and E.T. 
-- but it wasn't until 1993 that we saw what a brilliant man he can be. The
product of his genuis is really something to see -- it can bring tears to
your eyes just as it uplifts you. Throughout, we sense the deep control
which he so masterfully spreads. We watch Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson)
grow from an arrogant, self important man who hires Jews only to save money
 into  a moving figure, with  a deep sense of pride and accomplishment. The
film requires much work, and can be a harrowing experience -- go expecting
a quick entertainment and you'll be bitterly dissapointed. It does reward
the patient viewer. This is a mature Spielberg, and his deft hands shape an
absoloute masterpiece. This eqsuisite, beautiful film is a rare gem. It
does a good job of summarizing why I love movies. It leaves one breathless,
uplifted, and with much to think about. Afterwards you can reflect on
individual images, visions, and people. Laconic, removed, Schindler strides
through the film a detached prescence who watches all, does much, and
leaves feeling as if he could, should, have done more then he did and was
able to. The change seems natural -- in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, it
would be crude and would cheat the audience. Instead we are told a tale,
told a story. The film is punishing to watch, yes. But anyone who allows
themselves to get involved will experience a miracle, and a genuine
masterpiece of a movie.   </P>
