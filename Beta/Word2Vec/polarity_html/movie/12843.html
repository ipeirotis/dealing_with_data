<P>It must be some sort of warped critical nightmare:  the best movie of
the year would be a summer vehicle, a Jim Carrey vehicle at that.  And
so it is.  _The Truman Show_ is the most perplexing, crazed, paranoid
and rib-tickling morality play I've seen since I-don't-know-when.</P>
<P>Don't credit Carrey.  It starts with Andrew Niccol (Gattaca), who
created the script ten years ago.  The story, replete with sublte
religious and philisophical undertones, is about a man who discovers
that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience.
(Ironically, it was within these past ten years that "reality-based"
television have become a predominant fixture into our culture.  Who
knew?)</P>
<P>One-upping Niccol, it was when unlikely candidate-director Peter Weir
took the helm that things fell into place.  Weir had the nearly
impossible task to create the unimitible tone, deftly mixing Capra with
Kafka, throwing George Bailey in a universe inhabited by Rod Serling.
It was Weir's first stroke of genius to create Seahaven: a suburban
paradise/prison that would make Spielberg cower in shame. For example,
bystander-extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers
along with the latest issue of _Dog Fancy_.  The nicest touch are the
plethora of subtle hints for Truman to _not_ leave the island.</P>
<P>Credit Weir for his second stroke: the casting of Carrey.  Carrey seems
to be the type of character actor who would always turn "on" and act
goofy whenever the camera is near.  Not here.  His performance is so
subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on.
And although Carrey does not deserve an Academy Award nomination (just
as well, the Academy rarely honors goofy comedians, excepting Robin
Williams), he stretches enough to alter his hyper-silly image
considerably.  Playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his
most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of Jim Carrey's life.
No pun intended.</P>
<P>Better in a smaller, more pivotal role is Ed Harris as Christof, who
mixes the right amount of his Apollo 13 "work the problem, people"
character with Dustin Hoffman's megaglomaniac producer in _Wag the Dog_,
and then only slightly Svengalian.  It is clear that he is torn between
the Nielson ratings and Truman's well being.  Yes, in his own misguided
way he loves Truman as a father to a son, and has provided the best
universe he could provide.  He thinks.</P>
<P>Rounding out the cast is Natascha McElhone (Mrs. Dalloway) as Carrey's
true "forbidden love", Sylvia, very effective in another pivotal small
role.  Laura Linney (Congo) and Noah Emmerich (Copland) have the
unfortunate task of playing Truman's wife and best friend; their
sitcom-ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character
development.  The exception is at the very beginning, where they speak
into the camera, wholeheartedly believing that their participation is
truly good for Truman, and for society in general.</P>
<P>There are other little problems with the script.  Are we to assume that
toddler Truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a
gigantic dome during his formative years?  Was there any reason as to
why in one scene, it rained solely on Truman, even though it never had
to?  How is it they hire hundreds of extras, and none of them could
drive a boat, and yet Truman, fearful of water, is helming a sailboat
effortlessly?  And couldn't Christof have turned off the wind, to strand
Truman at sea?</P>
<P>These little contrivances, however, do not hold a candle to the overall
effect of the work.  The audience gets the feeling that it is watching
the actual show, and we are drawn to Truman's mundane existence for no
other reason than it is there.  The final result effortlessly combines
the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing
discomfort that hits you square in the gut.  Upon leaving the theater, I
was looking up in the sky, wondering if it was nothing more than a
gigantic dome. Just checking.</P>
