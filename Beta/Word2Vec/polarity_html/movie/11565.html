<P>WILD THINGS
Reviewed by Jamie Peck<HR>Rating: *** (out of ****) 
Columbia / 1:53 / 1998 / R (language, violence, nudity, sex)
Cast: Matt Dillon; Neve Campbell; Denise Richards; Kevin Bacon; Daphne 
Rubin-Vega; Bill Murray; Theresa Russell; Robert Wagner; Carrie Snodgress 
Director: John McNaughton 
Screenplay: Stephen Peters <HR>Jerry Springer has got nothing on "Wild Things." John McNaughton's new thriller 
tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than Springer's notoriously 
sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality, threesomes, poolside 
catfights, slutty rich bimbos, even redneck gator-wrestling, they're all part of 
the movie's raucous, complex storyline. But even trash TV topicality can't drag 
"Wild Things" down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find 
late-night on the USA network, only infinitely more palatable and with a solid 
ensemble cast. Despite a smattering of needless scenes (most of them sexual in 
nature), there's wicked fun to be had here. "Wild Things" would be a guilty 
pleasure, only there's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it. </P>
<P>High school guidance counselor Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) is well-liked in the 
town of Blue Bay, especially by pretty, popular Kelly Van Ryan (Denise 
Richards), whose family name is among the Florida yachting enclave's most 
financially prominent. Hoping to take her crush to a physical level, Kelly 
seductively slinks into Lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a 
fundraiser, but, the very next day, tearfully admits to her trollop mother 
(Theresa Russell) that she was raped. Before long, Blue Bay detectives Ray 
Duquette (Kevin Bacon) and Gloria Perez (Daphne Rubin-Vega) are listening to 
similar allegations from Kelly's rebel classmate Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell). 
Lombardo, who maintains his innocence, hires neck brace-sporting, opportunistic 
lawyer Ken Bowden (Bill Murray) to defend him in court. </P>
<P>The previews give away the following revelations, so if you haven't seen any of 
the movie's spots on the television or in the theater, you might want to skip to 
the next paragraph. While cross-examining Suzie on the witness stand, Bowden 
gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that 
Kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that Lombardo was 
sleeping with her mother and not with her. To pay Lombardo for the damages, 
Kelly's mother breaks her daughter's trust fund and gives him $8.5 million. But 
Lombardo, Kelly and Suzie are actually all working together, and plan to take 
the money and run as fast as they can. Duquette and Perez, however, begin to 
suspect that there's more afoot to the case than just false accusations. </P>
<P>If there's a major drawback to "Wild Things," it's that it's oversexed to a 
fault. The much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between Dillon, Campbell 
and Richards is a turn-off. It's also cut short (sorry, guys), and should have 
been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too 
often. What we don't see is far more effective than what we do. Another example 
of this is Kevin Bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene. Er, no 
thanks. Also, Bacon's Duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and 
overwritten. Daphne Rubin-Vega, from Broadway's "Rent," tries to compensate for 
a superfluous character. Theresa Russell is just plain wooden. And when, in the 
end, all is out in the open, ask yourself if certain scenes involving these 
three were really necessary. </P>
<P>But what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of 
surprises (some predictable, some not) that never seems to end. "Wild Things" 
has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews, and most are so gleefully, 
over-the-top nasty that you can't help but be charmed by their absurd 
showmanship. A great deal of amusement also comes from watching Bill Murray in a 
supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent; 
Murray's a stitch, especially when pulling up beside the Van Ryan limo after 
winning Lombardo's case and flipping them off. And don't leave when the closing 
credits hit the screen, or you'll miss the film's best part -- four bonus 
flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns, 
plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell. </P>
<P>Speaking of bombshells, Denise Richards, who plays almost every scene in a blue 
bikini top, does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never 
allowed to flaunt in "Starship Troopers." Matt Dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced 
sex appeal, and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision. Neve 
Campbell, lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig, gives Suzie a 
vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the 
conspiring trio. Re-edited and toned down a bit, the dynamics between these 
three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths. But what we're 
given works well enough. "Wild Things" is highly entertaining and, indeed, very 
wild.<HR>© 1998 Jamie Peck
