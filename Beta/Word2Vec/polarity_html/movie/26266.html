<P>(Note: This review originally appeared  on REELING in early June prior to its 
theatrical release)</P>
<P>As the month of June closes I can't help but look back on all the shitty, 
joyless, but damn expensive Summer flicks I've endured; the kinetic 
showboating of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2, the empty headed Toyota commercial 
visuals of GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, the boring platitudes coupled with jerky 
action and BRAVEHEART's plot in GLADIATOR, the non-stop gross out desperation 
of ROAD TRIP, and the Saturday Morning Cartoon drawings of TITAN A.E. They 
all looked fantastic and seemed to hold a wealth of possible treasures, you 
know, the Saturday Matinee thrill of adventure with maybe some good 
characterization thrown in, but no, they pandered and failed to even elicit 
the cheesy thrills of past summer crapola like DEEP BLUE SEA or THE 
FRIGHTENERS.</P>
<P>So I return, my childlike hopes squashed, to the ol' reliable art house. I 
don my spectacles, attempt to procure a three-day growth of beard and I 
enter, tail naturally between those legs of mine, one of my old theatre 
haunts. Pleasant memories waft my way-- the friendly security guard babbling 
about Fellini films, the male ticket ripper with the eye-liner and the 
RESERVOIR DOG's T-shirt, ahhh yes a world as full of magical incongruities as 
a Fellini film. You see in the early to mid nineties the art houses have been 
my refuge from the Hollywood crap that pollutes cities across this fair 
nation. I remember the hipster urgency of RESERVOIR DOGS, the sad\funny paces 
of TREES LOUNGE, the love of life found in BIG NIGHT, but that was long ago. 
I've been disappointed by these as well; most recently my trips to the art 
houses have been less fruitful; PECKER was John Waters homogenized (and he 
was the one doing the homogenizing, no lose), THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE 
was a choir to sit through, DESERT BLUE felt like a lame WB special complete 
with Kevin Williamson style quirks, and on. Most indie films are now just as 
manufactured as the mainstream ones.</P>
<P>Those "fringe" movies have spawned into their own little market full of 
flicks with their own brand of high concepts; the casual drug use, coolly 
unshaven men with tussled hair pontificating like philosophy scholars, hip 
white boys who use the "n" word like it's the ultimate badge of rebel cool, 
and the requisite Janeane Garafalo appearance. It's become just as tough to 
make a personal statement in that kind of arena so now previous indie film 
makers like Todd Solonz, David O Russell and Neil La Blute have migrated to 
major film, which is a good thing. It's about time for a shift.</P>
<P>JESUS' SON is chock full of the elements of indie films I've grown to 
loathe. It has the grungy-chic hand held photography, the medium close-ups of 
junkies shooting up, the quirky supporting characters, and it's a bit of an 
episodic, shambling mess vacillating wildly from one tone to another. But it 
has a certain lackadaisical charm, a bit of free wheeling gusto that those 
mapped out, formulaic big budget summer movies lack. Its actors and 
screenplay overcome the occasional handicaps, and maybe I would have given it 
an even higher grade had I not been so put off by its essential ingredients. 
(One can only sit through so many hiply off center philosophical junkie 
flicks…). But it coasts on a sort of sedated charm that leaked through the 
screen and gently tap-danced on me. I felt like I was viewing something 
genuine, something with a distinct feel and voice and even some insight into 
its low lifes. This movie is at least alive while, nowadays, most indies come 
at us DOA.
Billy Crudup stars as F*ck Head (a nickname that stuck after he seemed to go 
out of his way to keep it) a passive drifter who lets life carry him 
wherever. He's a follower who stumbles into the junkie lifestyle after 
developing a dysfunctional relationship with a Michelle (Samantha Morton), a 
petulant junkie. He's a bit of a flaky idiot but a damn likeable one the way 
Crudup plays him. The actor gives FH a sort of off kilter John Cusack on 
smack vibe (the character could be the directionless Lloyd Dobler of SAY 
ANYTHING after being dumped by the Ione Skye character). He's charming in an 
enigmatic way with mannerisms that seem ever so slightly off. Crudup's an 
attractive actor (like a cross between Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise at their 
scruffiest) and for him to play this kind of loser with the same lived in 
baggage he gave heartthrob track star Prefontaine in WITHOUT LIMITS (the 
better of the two bio-pics of "the James Dean of track") marks him as not 
only a major talent but a very capable leading man just waiting to hit the 
mainstream.</P>
<P>FH wanders through several low down adventures, most unrelated, with a 
narrative that could kindly be called non-existent. The film is like a series 
of SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL shorts strung together, all featuring the same 
character and his progressions (or digressions). Each short has a guest star 
who most likely won't be seen in the next one. Dennis Leary, for once 
abandoning his rat-tat-tat delivery for subtle characterization, is one of 
those appearing briefly as a stoic drunk who tears apart his old home in 
order to sell the copper for money. Jack Black (HIGH FIDELITY) appears in the 
film's most amusing "short", as a hospital orderly who acts like a kid in a 
candy store. He has what may be the funniest scene I've seen all year; a bit 
involving mind-altering drugs, and incompetent staff and an impaled patient 
is like Preston Sturges meets Tarantino and all that implies. Dennis Hopper 
is sharper than usual as a craggy old drunk who got shot twice, by his two 
different wives and Holly Hunter acts exactly like Holly Hunter.</P>
<P>Samantha Morton (SWEET AND LOWDOWN, in which she was nominated for an Academy 
Award) appears in several of the shorts as the woman who loves and 
manipulates Fuck Head. Her child-like sweetness is matched with a world-weary 
quality that seems to be taking over. Their relationship is a passive 
aggressive one with the Morton character largely in control.</P>
<P>JESUS SON may be annoying to some for it's a film that's all ebb and flow, 
excitement and boredom. The film doesn't really end so much as run out gas 
which I suppose is appropriate considering the character's journey; if it had 
ended differently with some overly dramatic conclusion I'd probably be 
bemoaning it, though it seems that JESUS' SON overstays its welcome just a 
bit with its last twenty minutes seeming largely redundant, sort of like how 
it might be to watch Benjamin and Elaine from THE GRADUATE after they realize 
how wrong they are for each other (that had to be a real long bus ride) and 
begin getting on each other's nerves, eventually splitting up and returning 
to their old lives.</P>
<P>JESUS SON isn't a great film but in a time where indies seem to be dying a 
slow boring death, it's an appropriate return to what independent film should 
be doing. And after a month of wadding through high concept Hollywood crap 
it's just what I needed to get excited about the movies again.</P>
