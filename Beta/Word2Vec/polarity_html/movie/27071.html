PROOF OF LIFE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>If you're a filmmaker looking for a star for your next action picture, 
there isn't any better choice today than Russell Crowe (GLADIATOR), the 
star of Taylor Hackford's PROOF OF LIFE.  He exudes a controlled 
intensity that always seems just below the boiling point.  Bringing 
intelligence and quiet charisma to his parts, he adds something special 
that isn't flashy but isn't subtle either.  </P>
<P>Crowe's costar in PROOF OF LIFE is Meg Ryan, to whom he has been linked 
romantically in real life.  In the movie, in which there is supposed to 
be romantic sparks, the chemistry between Crowe and Ryan is as dead as a 
campfire extinguished a week ago.  Ryan, who has been terrific in a wide 
variety of roles from WHEN HARRY MEET SALLY... to COURAGE UNDER FIRE, 
never finds the right tone this time.  Employing a very limited 
emotional range, she spends much of the movie glassy-eyed, holding, but 
not smoking, a lit cigarette, as if it were some sort of fashion 
statement.  Her character, Alice Bowman, is called a "little hippie" by 
her husband, Peter (David Morse), but she poses and acts more like an 
ex-fashion model.</P>
<P>The story is about K and R (kidnap and ransom) negotiators.  With jobs 
that make Kevin Spacey's in THE NEGOTIATOR look like a tea party in 
comparison, K and R negotiators specialize in executive kidnap cases, in 
which they negotiate the ransom with the kidnappers, usually third world 
rebels.  We learn that paying what the rebels ask is like trying to 
eradicate the gophers in your backyard by sticking a hose in one of 
their holes and trying to drown them.  Yield entirely to the kidnapper's 
demands and your "final" payments keep getting turned into down 
payments, forever delaying the release of the victim.  So long as you 
get the right proof of life -- a photo of the victim holding a recent 
newspaper being popular -- and find just the right price point, you can 
get your client freed in a matter of mere months.</P>
<P>Much of the story involves endless haggling over the price between Terry 
Thorne (Crowe) and the South American rebels who have kidnapped Peter.  
Unless you're a car dealer by trade, you're likely to find that this 
part becomes tedious.  The first two-thirds of the film stays in low 
gear as the negotiations drone on.  Eventually, the movie is transformed 
into quite a credible and satisfying action picture, in which Terry's 
old sidekick, Dino (David Caruso), joins him in the fun.</P>
<P>"Things don't happen for a reason," Alice tells Terry.  "They just 
happen."  Tony Gilroy's script is like that.  Although it throws out 
some interesting ideas, it has trouble fashioning them into a compelling 
thriller.  But, all is not lost.  The movie does prominently feature 
Russell Crowe.</P>
<P>PROOF OF LIFE runs 2:15.  It is rated R for violence, language and some 
drug material and would be acceptable for teenagers.</P>
