<P>A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (director: Michael Hoffman; cast: Kevin Kline
(Nick Bottom), Michelle Pfeiffer (Titania), Rupert Everett (Oberon),
Stanley Tucci (Puck), Calista Flockhart (Helena), Anna Friel (Hermia),
Christian Bale (Demetrius), Dominic West
(Lysander), David Strathairn (Theuseus), SophieMarceau (Hippolyta),
Roger Rees (Peter Quince), Max Wright (Robin Starveling), Gregory Jbara
(Snug), Bill Irwin (Tom Snout), Sam Rockwell (Francis Flute), Bernard
Hill (Egeus), 1999)</P>
<P>Shakespeare's lightweight farce is transported from 16th century Greece
to 19th century Tuscany (there are now bicycles with headlights to shine
in the night and wonderful operatic interludes). The plot revolves
around the upcoming wedding of Duke Theseus (David Strathairn) and
Hippolyta (Sophie Marceau). Problems arise when a forced marriage
between Hermia (Friel) and Demetrius (Bale) is proposed by Hermia's
father, even though Hermia is in love with Lysander (West), and Helena
(Calista) is madly in love with Demetrius. Another subplot has to do
with the group of would-be thespians who are asked to perform at the
duke's wedding, led by the weaver Nick Bottom (Kline). His over-the-top
performance is amusingly brilliant, as when he turns into an ass and
woos a beautiful queen, and when he emotes from that junior high school
type of play, "Pyramus and Thisby," that he is asked to perform at the
wedding. He ends up stealing the film with his energetic comical
rendition of a buffoon.This character has always been considered one of
Shakespeare's best comedy roles.</P>
<P>The fun and heart of the story takes place with one overnight trip into
the woods, where the unrelenting lovers travel to in their planned
elopement. The fun part begins when these mortals run unbeknownst to
them into the ever-playful Puck (Tucci), the servant of Oberon, who
sprinkles into their eyes a love potion that lures them into loving the
first person they see. Love in this fairyland setting has more to do
with chance than anything else since it is blind. The mix-ups that
follow Puck's interference, create new difficulties and allow for the
lovers to be manipulated and mismatched by Puck's magic. He even fools
the beautiful Fairy Queen Titania (Pfeiffer) into falling in love with
the transformed Bottom, now appearing as an ass, even though her true
love is the handsome Fairy King Oberon (Rupert).</P>
<P>Shakespeare's magic wasn't working; and, I think that was because an
hour or so of the play's dialogue was lopped off, making this three hour
play into a two hour movie. The consequences are that the characters
couldn't be fully developed; in fact, the film had a flatness to it that
belied how good its lush cinematography made it look. Instead of
character development, we got rolls in the mud to convey the deep
feelings of how the young lovers felt about the confusion Puck's love
potions had on them. Too dumb down Shakespeare even further, there were
times when the director used obvious facial gestures by the characters
to let us in on how to react to what they were doing. This is sort of
like the canned responses for those tv shows, where a sign is held up to
let the audience know when to applaud.</P>
<P>What was eloquent about the film, that made it a passable viewing
experience, was due to the superb cast, a mixture of true Shakespearian
British actors; such as, Anna Friel, Christian Bale, and Dominic West,
and the feisty non-Shakespearian actors, Calista Flockhart, Stanley
Tucci, Rupert Everett and Michelle Pfeiffer.Then there was the stirring
use of Verdi's greatest operatic hits throughout the film, which fitted
conveniently in with the director's 19th century Italian theme.</P>
<P>This is a clever film; it is much better than the scores of amateur
stage productions that continually flood the country. But the director
made a lot of odd choices in this film that take away somewhat from the
magical feeling of the play and make it seem artificial, or more of a
commercial venture than it should be. There was no artistic reason to be
in 19th century Italy, except for its rich landscapes and colorful
costumes and beautiful villas shown. Also, the flatness and clumsiness
of the fairyland scenes when juxtaposed against the lively actor's
troupe, made this film seem uneven, even begging us to utter with
conviction the bard's choice words: "What fools these mortals be."</P>
