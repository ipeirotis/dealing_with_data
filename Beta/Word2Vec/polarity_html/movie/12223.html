<P>     Ukrainian film maker Vyacheslav Krishtofovich has used his latest 
film, A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED (which was one of the five Best Foreign 
Film nominees for the1998 Oscars), to take a darkly comic look at the 
current economic and social climate in the former Soviet Union.  
Krishtofovich is on record as saying that the "human warmth" evident 
during the height of socialism has been replaced by solitude and self-
interest in the new era of freedom.  As he says in a prepared Director's 
Statement: "In Ukrainian, the word 'love' and the word 'pity' are 
sometimes considered synonyms.  That is why I made this film about 
people whom I pity.  And whom I love."</P>
<P>     Today in the Ukraine, it's possible to buy and sell almost anything 
– drugs, sex, booze, and murder.  The Black Market is booming, and 
Kiev's sidestreets are teeming with drug dealers, prostitutes, and 
contract killers.  In this new environment, someone like Anatoli 
(Alexandre Lazarev), a reserved intellectual who was trained to be a 
translator in English and French, finds himself without work or self-
respect.  His wife, a successful advertising executive, is about to 
leave him for another man, and there's nothing he can do about it.  One 
day, he casually mentions his problems to a friend, Dima (Eugen Pachin), 
who suggests putting out a hit on his wife's lover.  With surprising 
rapidity, Dima puts Anatoli in contact with Kostia (Constantin 
Kostychin), who accepts the job over the phone, without meeting his 
client face-to-face.  But, instead of providing Kostia with his wife's 
lover's description, Anatoli gives the killer a picture of himself, 
figuring that arranging his own murder offers a quick and painless way 
out of a dreary life.  But, when a tryst with a prostitute (Tatiana 
Krivitska) re-invigorates Anatoli and causes him to change his mind, 
it's too late to call off the hit.  So, to save his life, Anatoli must 
hire another contract killer to eliminate the first one.</P>
<P>     With a script (by Andrei Kourkov) that combines dark comedy, drama, 
and suspense, A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED proves to be a fascinating and 
engaging look at a country in turmoil.  The way the story develops, with 
a number of inventive twists overlaying a typically "Russian" sense of 
tragedy, conjures up images of the work of Fyodor Dostoevsky as filtered 
through O. Henry.  The screenplay drips with irony as Anatoli, who is an 
astute-but-ineffectual man, learns to use the mechanics of Ukrainian 
capitalism to rebuild the life that it was instrumental in destroying.  </P>
<P>     While most of the film wades through dramatic currents, with 
occasional swells of satire and grim humor, one extended sequence 
recalls the suspense of a Hitchcock feature.  It occurs when Anatoli is 
playing the bait in a trap devised by the second killer to catch the 
first.  The problem is that Anatoli has never seen Kostia, and has only 
a sketchy description of what he looks like.  As a result, the 
possibility exists that Anatoli could accidentally mark an innocent man 
for death.  For about fifteen minutes, Krishtofovich continually 
ratchets up the tension as Anatoli tries to flush out Kostia before he 
fulfills his contract.</P>
<P>     The only real problem with A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED is that there 
are occasions when things seem a little overplotted.  From time-to-time, 
the seams of the script show, and we're aware that a character is acting 
in a certain way because that's what the plot demands.  In particular, 
Anatoli's inability to call off the first contract killer seems like a 
contrivance.  After all, how hard does he really try? </P>
<P>     A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED's primary asset is that it offers an 
insider's perspective of the labyrinthine workings of contemporary Kiev, 
and how the transition from the old ways to the new ones have overturned 
the values and shifted the balance of a society.  (At one point, a 
character remarks, "Before we had friendships.  Now we have business 
relationships.")  It's a plus that the movie is well-acted, gripping, 
and populated with enough bizarre twists to keep even a casual viewer 
involved.  Although not a masterpiece, A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED is a 
strong and worthwhile effort from an acclaimed Ukrainian director.</P>
