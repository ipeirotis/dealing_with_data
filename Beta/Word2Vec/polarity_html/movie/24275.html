<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>My Life as a Dog is an endearing kidpic from Sweden about a 12-year-old,
Ingemar (Anton Glavelius), who cutely grows on you with his devilish
antics, whether flashing his curiously innocent eyes at a would-be
girlfriend or dressed to the nines in a bow tie and white shirt or
getting a bottle unstuck from his private parts in a failed lesson on
sex education he was participating in. This is a coming-of-age film,
that plays as bittersweet melodramatics. It is enlivened by how lovable
Ingemar is, as he learns about life by evaluating the big events in the
world and then comparing it with his own life. He is much concerned
about the Soviet dog Laika being sent up in space to die for a mission
the dog had no choice in undertaking and compares that event with his
own pet dog who is taken from him when he is uprooted to live in the
country. It's a pleasant little film, with its small aims hitting its
target repeatedly, quietly reflecting the joys and sorrows the youngster
must go through in order to grow up, and how the bland 1950s and its
omens of the future in space travel, new pop-up toasters, and a TV in
every house, influence the youngster's life.</P>
<P>The picture follows this intelligent child around to see the world that
he sees, as he is growing up in a single-parent home. His father is not
heard from, being somewhere in the tropics working on a banana boat, his
mother is very sick and dying from TB, and his older brother Erik is
always fighting with him. Together they get on their mother's nerves,
until she can't bear it anymore. Finally their mother gets so sick that
she can't look after them and they are both sent away for the summer to
live with different relatives in the country. The biggest disappointment
for Ingemar is that he can't take his dog with him, it supposedly was
brought to a shelter but he will never see it again. The title of the
film is derived from his comparison of the fates of the Soviet dog with
his dog, whereby both their lives are sacrificed without their consent.</P>
<P>His guardians are Uncle Gunnar (Tomas von Bromssen) and Aunt Ulla (Kicki
Rundgren), who are simple country bumpkins, unable to talk about
anything worldly but love to make small talk about the weather. He soon
warms up to them and gets accepted into their small town, where the
uncle works in the glass factory and is fanatical about soccer, being a
player himself on the local team and the coach of the boys' school
soccer team. The uncle also likes to observe the coconuts on the young
ladies in town. By being very easy to talk to, with no pretenses, he
thereby develops a warm and natural relationship with the youngster and
makes his summer experience a joyous one.</P>
<P>One of Ingemar's duties, is to go to the apartment downstairs to see if
the elderly Mr. Arvidsson (Didrik Gustavsson), who is infirmed to his
bed, is doing okay.The old man gets his jollies from having Ingemar read
aloud to him the women' underwear catalogues, which he keeps hidden
under his bed from his wife.</P>
<P>Ingemar's summer tales involve meeting a tomboy called Saga (Melinda
Kinnaman), who boxes with him, dresses like a boy to play soccer on
their team, gets him to tape her growing breasts so that they won't be
noticeable, and she also yearns to have him as a boyfriend. He makes
friends with a youngster who has green-colored hair and whose father
builds a spacecraft that the children ride in until it crashes; he acts
as a bodyguard for a well-endowed glassworker, who is posing nude for a
statue of the Virgin Mother. He falls comically through the skylight of
the roof as he tries to get a better view of her; he meets some of the
other odd characters in town, such as the trapeze artist who can
remember all the U.S. presidents, even after he falls. He really has fun
as he sits in the fun house his uncle is building, talking about life
with his surrogate-father role model, as he is being initiated, as the
poet Robert Bly says is necessary to do, into the male world.</P>
<P>Happy to be back home at the end of the summer and wanting to tell his
mother everything he did, until he sadly finds that she has to be
hospitalized. She soon dies before he can tell her what he did during
the summer and give her his birthday gift, a pop-up toaster. He is then
forced to return during the winter to live with his uncle again. But
things are little different now. He learns again about death, as Mr.
Arvidsson died. He also must now sleep in Mrs. Arvidsson new apartment
because his uncle tells him there is not enough space in theirs and that
it would be good for him to keep her company. But he finds much needed
affection from Saga, who is behaving more like a young girl smitten by
love and less like a tomboy.</P>
<P>Director Halstrom has a nice touch in working with the youngster, whose
relationship with his uncle is priceless. The film is charming, it is
sad, it is true-to-life, and never maudlin or sugary. It's a good
nostalgia film for all those yearning to look back at their childhood,
even if it be only vicariously through Ingemar. I fell for the film
without being swept off my feet by it. The message underlying Ingemar's
experience, is that life holds so much suffering in it, that one might
as well get a few laughs out of it while one can.</P>
<P>The scenes of the snow on the TV screen while all the neighbors are
brought in to watch a movie, the radio broadcast of the Swedish boxer
Ingemar Johansson landing a lucky punch and knocking out the American
champ Floyd Patterson, and the challenging games kids play to compete
against each other, all brought back to me bittersweet memories of the
1950s.</P>
