<P>     In the production notes for SCREAM 3, there is a heading titled
"Rules of a Trilogy" which reads: "Chapter One sets the rules. Chapter Two
bends the rules. But in the finale, forget the rules." That's as succinct
a summation as any for why, as this particular trilogy draws to a close,
it feels one chapter too long. SCREAM revived the moribund slasher movie
genre by mining both laughs and scares from horror film conventions. 
SCREAM 2 kept the pace by turning the satire towards horror sequels, and
even the first SCREAM. SCREAM 3, it turns out, does forget the rules. It
forgets that a film based on scary parody of scary movie cliches had
better be scary or funny, but not cliched.</P>
<P>     A few more years have passed since the events in SCREAM 2 as we are
re-introduced to our gang of survivors. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is
living in seclusion, working from home as a counselor on a crisis hotline. 
Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) anchors an "Entertainment
Tonight"-type program after flopping on "60 Minutes II." Cotton Weary
(Liev Schreiber) has become a popular T.V. talk show host and cameo actor
in STAB 3, the latest film based on the Woodsboro murders, on which Dewey
Riley (David Arquette) is working as a consultant. When cast members of
STAB 3 begin turning up dead, accompanied by photos of Sidney's mother as
a young woman, Sidney is drawn out of hiding to find out why. It seems
someone connected to the film is creating his/her own murderous rewrites
on the fly. Or perhaps it's someone investigating the murders. Or perhaps
Sidney's mother herself has returned from beyond the grave.</P>
<P>     The tortuous path to unmasking the killer(s) has, of course, become
one of the series' trademarks -- and, for my money, the most annoying. 
There are suspects a-plenty -- homicide Det. Kincaide (Patrick Dempsey); 
STAB 3 cast members including Jennifer (Parker Posey) and Angelina (Emily
Mortimer); none-too-subtly-named producer John Milton (Lance Henriksen);
director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) -- in a non-stop parade of hints,
motives and opportunities. Director Wes Craven and screenwriter Ehren
Kruger (stepping in for creator Kevin Williamson) get so focused on
whodunnit, in fact, that they rarely give any juice to what the person
whodunnit is doing. There are a couple of tense moments, including
effective use of a one-way mirror and the surprising perils of a movie
set, but there's nothing to match the nerve-wracking Drew Barrymore
sequence in SCREAM or the crawl across the killer in SCREAM 2. As a
chiller, it's fairly uninspired chase-n-shriek stuff.</P>
<P>     The humor doesn't fare much better, drifting away from commentary on
movies to linger on commentary on movie-making. Kruger tosses off some
solid gags, but they tend to be of the industry-jokey variety (including a
few cute but unnecessary cameos). He even misses some obvious 
opportunities, letting characters split up in a big spooky house with nary
an ironic observation and making everyone too stupid to draw connections
when the killer uses an electronic device to mimic voices. It becomes too
easy to see SCREAM 3 as a step towards exactly the kind of formulaic
horror film the series originally skewered. Even when the humor works, it
feels too easy -- and too played -- to take shots at the people who make
the movies than to take shots at the movies themselves. Kruger opts to
chuckle at career-obsessed directors, bimbo starlets who don't know
VERTIGO from PSYCHO and genre film actors getting absurdly Method about
creating their "characters."</P>
<P>     The height of irony is that you can see that kind of deadly earnest
acting going on in SCREAM 3. The primary offender is Campbell, who looks
as though she could only be dragged back to the set after being promised
Sidney would grow as a character. She does her damndest to make sure we
all understand how haunted she is, as though anyone could possibly care
about the deep psychological underpinnings of Sidney Prescott. It's one
thing for a character to make a reference to the developments in the
GODFATHER trilogy; it's another for Campbell to pretend she's playing
Michael Corleone. SCREAM 3 is a purely functional shocker, but it takes
all the wrong things seriously and plays all the wrong things for laughs.
Craven and company have forgotten the rules, all right. They've even
forgotten why the series was worth a third installment in the first place.</P>
