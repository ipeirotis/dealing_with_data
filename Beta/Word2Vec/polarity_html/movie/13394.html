<P>The Rich Man's Wife is one of those movies like Final Analysis or Body
Double, where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived
that you know you shouldn't be enjoying yourself. But somehow, the movie
just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of
things. Not that it's bad, it's just that it's been done before; and
better, in my opinion. </P>
<P>I realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre, but it's probably the
best analogy that I can come up with right now; you know how when you see a
spider or something in your toilet, striving helplessly to get out, and
instead of just flushing him, you end up kind of rooting for the little
guy? That's basically how I felt about this movie. I mean, it's not very
good, but it's not completely bad either. </P>
<P>The wife of the title is Josie Potenza (played nicely by Halle Berry). She
is married to Tony (Christopher McDonald...you know, the guy who looks like
Joe Piscapo), a really stressed-out businessman who drinks way to much and
doesn't give Josie the attention she deserves (*cough, cough*). Thus, she
is driven into the arms of another man, Jake Golden (Clive Owen). Near the
beginning of the film, Josie decides to try and work things out with Tony
by dumping Jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods. </P>
<P>Once there, however, Tony has to leave almost immediately due to business
details (I'm still not quite sure what line of work he's in). Making the
best of her situation, Josie stays there and begins making the rounds at
the local bars. One night, she meets a stranger named Cole (Peter Greene,
finally getting a meaty role). They have dinner together, and eventually,
both Josie and the audience start to realize that Cole is homicidal. After
learning that she is not happily married, Cole offers to "take care" of the
problem. </P>
<P>Managing to escape from the psychotic maniac, Josie returns home and starts
a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband. But then one
night, Cole shows up... </P>
<P>And here is where the fun begins. From this point on, it's going to be a
no-holds- barred cliche-fest, ripping off every movie from Strangers on a
Train to The Usual Suspects. This is why most critics panned this movie
when it first came out. And for the most part, they're right; The Rich
Man's Wife has nary one original bone in it's body. But who cares? If
you're looking for good ol' dumb suspense movie, you can't do much better
than this. And if you suspense buffs aren't already sold, it has a killer
of an ending too. </P>
