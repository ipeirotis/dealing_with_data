<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This Howard Hughes RKO film first previewed with the title "I Married A
Communist," but this title did not strike a chord with the audience, so
the title was changed and the story reworked so as to make it more of a
palatable melodrama than just a vituperative attack on the Communists.
But it still remains to be seen as mostly a propaganda movie.</P>
<P>The film opens with Brad Collins (Ryan) just married to the perfect
wife, Nan (Day), after a whirlwind romance where she had little time to
learn much about him. He stole her away from her former boyfriend, the
union leader, Jim Travis (Rober). Brad was a stevedore who worked his
way up in the San Francisco waterfront, to become a vice president for a
large shipping company. What he didn't tell his wife or anyone else, was
that as a young man named Frank Johnson he had joined the Communist
party.</P>
<P>When he was a Commie because he was an embittered young man, he was
romancing the sexy and treacherous blonde, Christine Norman (Janis). She
is upset that he dumped her to marry Nan and plans to get even with him
by exposing his Communist past. But her boss, the Commie party cell
head, Vanning (Gomez), has better uses for Brad. He brings Brad to the
party headquarters and forces him to go along with the party's political
agenda, and he also confiscates a big chunk of his salary. He tells Brad
that if he doesn't go along with it, he will expose him as a Commie and
implicate him as the murderer of a shop steward.</P>
<P>To spite Brad, Christine tracks down the non-thinking Don (Agar), the
handsome brother of Nan, who has just been given a stevedore's job by
Brad to curtail his aimless life, and she begins to romance him. He
seems to have turned over a new leaf with this work experience -- as the
film makes a concerted effort to show that work is good for you, that
the bosses are benign, that the union can only succeed if it roots out
the few Commie operators in it who are trying to subvert its legitimate
aims, that the Communist party is the Devil, and that you can't hide
from your past mistakes -- so you better think about what you are doing
before you sign up for a Communist membership, because you can never get
out of it once you join.</P>
<P>Christine, who works as a high paid photographer as a cover for her
party membership, indoctrinates the emotionally weak-minded Don into
siding with the party's positions and voicing the dogmatic Marxist
opinions against the labor bosses. Meanwhile, Brad and Jim are locked in
negotiations to prevent a strike that will shut-down the waterfront, and
Vanning sees this as an opportunity to get a foothold in the union by
forcing a waterfront shutdown. He orders Brad to stall negotiations and
sabotage any attempt for the two sides to get together.</P>
<P>When Christine doesn't listen to Vanning and refuses to dump Don after
she got all the use out of him that she could, he has her followed. When
he goes to her apartment and he finds that she told Don that she loves
him and that she is a Communist agent and, that she couldn't resist
telling him about Brad's Communist past and how he is still working for
the party, Vanning decides to take action against her. Don, meanwhile,
storms out of her place. But Vanning figures correctly that he is going
to Brad's house to confront him with the accusations and has him
followed.</P>
<P>Vanning hires a contract killer, Bailey (Talman), to kill Don. When
Christine calls to warn Nan that Don is in danger, it is too late, as
Don is killed by a hit and run driver as he is about to enter Brad's
house. When Nan confronts her husband about what he knows, he clams up.
Nan is finally fed-up with all his strange behavior of late and suspects
something is very wrong, and she decides to take action on her own by
going to see Christine. While there, she accidently learns that Bailey
did the hit, and she obtains the address where he runs a shooting
gallery.</P>
<P>With Nan pursuing Bailey, and with Vanning aware that Christine didn't
follow orders, Christine is killed, but it is made to look like a
suicide. Brad realizing his wife is now also in danger, eventually
tracks her down and finds her in Vanning's hideout, where Vanning plans
to kill her. There is a shootout, where Brad gives his life to save his
wife and get Vanning, but not before he apologizes to his wife for the
mistake he made as a young man and telling her he just couldn't tell her
what a fool he was to have ever joined such an evil organization, one
where they don't let you leave. She tells him that she loves him, as
Brad tells her, she should now marry Jim.</P>
<P>The story was a lot of hokum and misinformation: it distorted the
Communist influence in the country and how big business and unions act.
It attempted to make a propaganda film that reaffirms the American way
of life and familial love, but at the expense of reality. What the film
fails to say, since it was made during a period of the shameful American
witch hunts in congress, is that you can leave the party but the
government still wants you to confess that you joined and makes you rat
out all other party members, which is in violation of Fifth Amendment
rights.</P>
<P>If you can somehow get by the polemics and the cheesy script and view
this melodrama as  typical Hollywood, the film is quite entertaining, as
it is shot in a dramatic noir style by Musuraca and the leads all give
able performances, swallowing some of the most tasteless lines ever with
a great deal of bravado. Its moral tone is reaffirmed by Ryan, who must
repent from his past guilt by defending his wife, which comes in the
climactic scene.</P>
