<P>     If the ancient Greeks hadn't already defined drama as character in
action, Mike Leigh would have had to do it.  Leigh, along with Ken Loach,
Eric Rohmer and John Sayles, is in that exclusive company of film-makers
who understand that an effective story is not simply what happens to the
people on the screen -- it _is_ the people on the screen.  A Mike Leigh
film is the ultimate in low concept, the actors burying themselves so
deeply in their characters that they are able to tear out their hearts and
lay them bare.  SECRETS & LIES is about human beings, and that is what
makes it a rarity; what makes it great is how compelling the interaction
between those human beings turns out to be.</P>
<P>     SECRETS & LIES begins with a funeral for the adoptive mother of
Hortense Cumberbatch (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), a young black optometrist
in London.  Hortense decides that it is time to seek out her birth mother
at last, and the woman she finds is Cynthia Purley (Brenda Blethyn), a
factory worker with another illegitimate daughter, 20-year-old Roxanne
(Claire Rushbrook).  Initially in deep denial over their relationship,
Cynthia eventually warms to Hortense, and the two begin to form a
friendship.  But there is the question of how to introduce Hortense to the
rest of the family, a question complicated by the fact that tensions
already run deep and unspoken within the Purley family.</P>
<P>     There are so many brilliantly shaded characterizations in SECRETS &
LIES that the Oscars could find contenders in every major category if the
voters were inclined to notice.  Timothy Spall does a wondrous thing by
giving an urgency to a fundamentally decent man, a professional
photographer whose professional life is an attempt to capture moments of
serenity he is unable to find at home; Phyllis Logan invests Monica with a
reservoir of bitterness over her inability to have children, a bitterness
which spills over into contempt for Cynthia.  Marianne Jean-Baptiste's
Hortense is a quiet, centered woman who sees the life she might have led
in her half-sister Roxanne, played with a perpetual sneer by Claire
Rushbrook.  Even minor roles -- the social worker (Lesley Manville) who
gives Hortense the information she seeks; Maurice's one-time mentor (Ron
Cook), now a shattered alcoholic -- are so complete that SECRETS & LIES
grips you with its refusal to permit the intrusion of one-dimensional
characters.</P>
<P>     With so many superb characterizations in SECRETS & LIES, it is all
the more extraordinary that Brenda Blethyn's work leaps out at you.
Cynthia Purley is a woman whose entire life has been a desperate search
for someone to show her affection, a search which has resulted mostly in
pain, and Blethyn makes her one of the most heartbreaking characters I
have ever seen committed to film.  The scene in which Cynthia and Hortense
meet for the first time is staged by Leigh in one mesmerizing seven minute
take, with Blethyn taking us through a dizzying array of emotions:
regret, fear, anxiety, embarrassment, pride, relief.  Every word out of
Blethyn's mouth comes from the soul of a real person who wants nothing
more than happiness for herself and her family, and finds herself on the
verge of falling apart every time she is disappointed.  It is an utterly
remarkable piece of acting.</P>
<P>     As fascinating as all these individuals are, however, it is the way
in which they are joined to tell a story of a family in crisis which
elevates SECRETS & LIES.  The final act of the film takes place at a
birthday party for Roxanne, with Hortense attending as Cynthia's "friend,"
her true identity unknown to anyone else.  Scene after scene explores the
dynamics of familial interaction, with resentments bubbling just beneath
the surface at every moment, and shows how the things we hide from the
people who are supposed to be closest to us in our lives create mountains
of unresolved issues.  Leigh is so skillful for so long that it is a
genuine shame that the final fifteen minutes are devoted largely to an
over-wrought airing of emotional dirty laundry, with tears, speeches and
accusations flying across the living room.  He didn't need manufactured
drama of that sort, because the characters in SECRETS & LIES live lives of
everyday drama.  They, and Mike Leigh's film, are beautiful simply because
they are human.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 family secrets:  9.</PRE>
