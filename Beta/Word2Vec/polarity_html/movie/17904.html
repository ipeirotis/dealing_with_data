<PRE>METROLAND
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>With a lovely wife and baby, a lucrative job, and an upper middle class
home in the British suburbs, Chris, as he tells everyone, couldn't be
happier.  Too bad he doesn't believe it.  Lately he's been talking long
walks alone at night making voluminous mental lists "'til the panic
subsides."  Among other anxieties, he has become almost paralyzed with
dreams of his long gone, youthful life across the Channel.</P>
<P>10 years ago, as a photographer living in Paris with a sexy French
girlfriend, he boasted to his friends then of his complete bliss.  The
problem is that, just below the surface, he was as full of doubts then
as now.  And then, as now, he was blessed with a sensuous and supporting
woman with whom he shared his dreams as well as some wild sex.  (Okay,
if truth be told, the current state of his marital sex life isn't what
it was when he first got married.)</P>
<P>If ever a guy had it all, twice in fact, it is Chris.  Philip Saville's
METROLAND, set in 70's England and 60's Paris, is an insightful and
intimate character study of Chris and the two loves of his life.
Without explosive behavior, the finely tuned film challenges your mind
rather than manipulating your emotions with the cheap theatrics typical
of most films.  In a stunning performance that is purposely shallow and
ambiguous, Christian Bale becomes Chris.  Never letting Chris degenerate
into a caricature, Bale makes his character easy to empathize with.</P>
<P>Cutting back and forth between the two decades, you want Chris to stay
with the one he's with at the time, and yet you can understand the
emotions tugging him one way and then another.  In some ways like
Michael Apted's 35UP, the documentary that contrasts people's feelings
about their life at various ages, METROLAND provides few easy answers.
But it asks some pertinent and challenging questions.</P>
<P>As the story starts, Toni (Lee Ross), Chris's bosom buddy from his
student days to his days in Paris, has come for his first visit in 5
years.  Like an evil twin, Toni, who is jealous of Chris's success,
taunts him for renouncing his former Bohemian lifestyle in favor of his
new bourgeois success.  Like the devil, Toni provides many temptations
for Chris.</P>
<P>Emily Watson, after 2 juicy and high profile starring roles (BREAKING
THE WAVES and HILARY AND JACKIE) that garnered her back-to-back Academy
Award nominations for Best Actress, takes a crucial supporting role this
time.  Playing Chris's wife, Marion, Watson gives a preciseness and
richness to a role that in lesser hands would fade into the background.</P>
<P>Chris is no match for Marion's intellect.  She knows what she wants, and
it is Chris for a husband.  Not long after they meet, she remarks
casually about his getting married someday.  Shocked, he explains that
he's a rebel who'll never be married.  With complete confidence, she
explains why he most certainly will be wed.  "You're not original enough
not to," she tells him perspicaciously.</P>
<P>As his lovely, free-spirited, French girlfriend Annick, Elsa Zylberstein
gives her character a sympathetic warmth that allows Annick to be much
more than just an extended fling.  The casting is ideal in that she is
only modestly better looking than Marion, which makes Chris's indecision
about something other than surface beauty.</P>
<P>METROLAND's strength comes from its remarkably sophisticated attitude
about sexuality.  The picture's completely natural portrayal of sex is
funny, playful and quite erotic without ever being cheap or excessively
explicit.  Chris's first sexual encounter with Annick, with him being
awkwardly overeager and her being lovingly supportive, is precious.
Similarly, the pillow talk between Chris and Marion about some of their
earlier, wild sexual encounters is sweet and humorous.</P>
<P>Adrian Hodges's intelligent script, based on the novel by Julian Barnes,
is filled with real characters that never say anything that rings false.
Hodges captures Chris's predicaments with delicate precision.  Even the
story's most minor characters are well drawn.  One passenger on a train,
for example, laments that this is his last ride on this route.  He's
been put out to pasture by the firm for whom he has worked for 42 years.
His going away gift was a whiskey decanter.  Sadly, he comments that,
after that long, they should have realized that he didn't drink.  The
younger Chris discusses the origin of the name of the area, Metroland,
with him.  Chris says he wants to leave Metroland.  "It doesn't matter
where you go," the man counsels him.  "Metroland isn't a place.  It's a
state of mind."</P>
<P>The only disappointing aspects of the production are the cinematography
and the music.  The former is dull and dingy, and the latter is bland
and uninspired.  Absent these two, relatively minor criticisms, the film
is an astute and intriguing story loaded with subtle but quite
impressive acting.</P>
<P>After seeming to have no satisfactory conclusion, the movie ends quite
well.  As you leave the theater, you may begin to wonder how the rest of
Chris's life will turn out.  Remembering that it was just a movie, your
thoughts may then turn to anticipation for these actors' next movies,
hoping that their future films will be as rewarding and satisfying as
this one.</P>
<P>METROLAND runs 1:45.  It is not rated but might be an R for sex, nudity
and profanity and would be acceptable for older and mature teenagers.</P>
