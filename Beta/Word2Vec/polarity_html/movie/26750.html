<P>As we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the
Middle East at the moment, Hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to
get involved, by telling stories and expressing opinions.</P>
<P>This film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult
lifetimes of two Marine colonels, Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) and
Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson). They fought side by side in
Vietnam, where Childers saved Hodges' life by shooting an unarmed
POW. That's against the rules of war but understandable, in this story
anyway, under the specific circumstances. Certainly Hodges is not
complaining. Years pass. Hodges, whose wounds make him unfit for
action, gets a law degree and becomes a Marine lawyer. Childers, is
now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country
with his life and sould. Because of his excellent record, Childers is
sent to Yemen to rescue the American ambassador (Ben Kingsley),
cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and
snipers blasting from rooftops. Childers does what he has to do:
evacuate the family and protect the men under his command. After three
Marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire, he orders his
troops to shoot into the firing crowd. More than 80 Yemeni men, women,
and children are mowed down. Childers is immediately accused of
ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed
civilians. He persuades his old friend Hodges to represent him in the
courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film. Did
Childers violate authorized U.S. military rules of engagement? Or are
there simply no rules in war?</P>
<P>The answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious, but the
inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions. The
murder of 83 "innocent civilians" has to result into something greater
than a simple trial in the U.S. Where is the accusations from the Arab
leaders? Where is the U.N.? The film ends without even telling the
most interesting story: what happens on the international arena?</P>
<P>This film (in a way akin to films such as "A Few Good Men") has
already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and
even of racism. These accusations are pretty heavy, but also
unfair. What director William Friedklin truly broke was the rules of
decent filmmaking. One of the earliest apparent problems with 'Rules
of Engagement' is its lack of credibility. The entire operation in
Yemen may remind us about what happens in the Middle East right now,
but is overdone, contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events
had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to
proceed. A lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it
as reality. That is precisely why it's not offensive. It is completely
unobjective. Many stories are started and never finished. Many
questions are asked, but never answered. A lot of parallels are
referring to nothing. It seems that neither the director, producers or
the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their
film. Is it about Arab mentality? America's foreign policies?
America's role in the world? Corruption in the higher circles? It goes
on and on. It consists of countless stories, but not a definable
plot. It tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing
for no one.</P>
<P>I think that it is ironic, because director William Friedkin's
probably most acclaimed film was "The Exorcist" which had a silly
story, but became a rather effective film. In this case you have a
strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly
film. Though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism (such as
the impressive battle scenes), his latest film does simply not
engage. I believe that Friedklin is a director that is absolutely
depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to
succeed. It's obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore
a catastrophe. The characters feel designed, unreal, merely shadows,
with no life outside the conflict. Even the actors can not save this
film from going under. Though both Jackson and Jones act admirably,
with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this,
it is not something that these great actors can boast of. They have
roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the
back. Jackson is gray and Jones uninteresting. The rest of the cast,
including Ben Kingsly, Blair Underwood and Guy Pearce are simply
waiting for their paychecks.</P>
<P>The time has come for the verdict. On the charges of complete lack of
objectivity, I find this film guilty. On the charges of breaking the
rules of reasonable filmmaking, I find it guilty. But on the charges
of racism I find this film not guilty, because of it's inconclusive
and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere, not only when
concerning the Arab population. I must admit that the film is
dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and I do think
that screenwriter Stephen Gaghan went a bit too far, portraying the
Yemeni people almost as stereotypical Hollywood bad-guys. This is very
sad, since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity
and proclaim the truth. However, it is absolutely necessary to
remember that the Muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the
terrorist activity in and outside the United States. And that it's not
a coincidence that U.S. residents in the Middle East, including Yemen
are on constant maximum alert.</P>
