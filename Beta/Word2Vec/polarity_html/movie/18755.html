RONIN (director: John Frankenheimer; cast: Robert De Niro (Sam), Jean
Reno (Vincent), Natascha McElphone (Dierdre), Stellan Skarsgard
(Gregor), Sean Bean (Spence), Skipp Sudduth (Larry), Michael Lonsdale
(Jean-Pierre), Jonathan Pryce (Seamus), Katrina Witt (Natascha
Kirilova), 1998)</P>
<P>Ronins are the samurais of old Japan who are dishonored because they
failed to protect their master.They roamed the country as bandits and
soldiers of fortune, but still remained loyal to their masters.This
action film takes place in modern France, as a group of secretive older
military types (CIA and Kgb'ers and soldiers of fortune) are likened to
the Ronins. They come together, ala DIRTY DOZEN style, and meet this
taciturn Irish bartender (Natascha) in this  Parisian bar (Paris has a
seedy look to it throughout the film, graffiti is everywhere). She tells
them the minimum details of the plans.The real leader turns out to be
Seamus (Pryce), who chooses to remain in the background. They aim to use
these so-called Ronins  to ambush a well-protected outfit who have in
their possession a steel black case they want retrieved. The filmmaker
chooses to not tell the Ronins or the audience what valuables are in the
case, only that both the Russians and their group (it is implied that
they are IRA) are interested in getting it, and since they don't have
enough money to buy it they are going to steal it.</P>
<P>Sam (De Niro) is ex-CIA; he is in this caper for the money. He is a cool
customer who never panics, and is a natural leader.Vincent (Reno) is the
Frenchman who is Sam's truest friend. Spence (Bean) is the edgy Irish
weapon's man. Larry (Skipp) is the experienced driver. Gregor (Stellan)
is the computer expert and ex-KGB man. This multi-national crew runs
into a series of betrayals; duplicity becomes the norm. There are
outlandish car chases, seemingly trying to outdo other famous film car
chases. Cars go the wrong way on highways, bystanders get gunned down
and cars' crash. One car chase is reminiscent of the Paris tunnel where
Princess Di died, the other the sinewy road Princess Grace had her
fatality on in southern France. Mindless adventure takes hold, and the
story becomes implausible and unimportant. An effort was made to provide
a crisp dialogue, as Mamet, was supposedly the Richard Weisz, who is
mentioned in the credits as the story writer. It was wise of Mamet for
not displaying his own name. Yet there is a sprinkling of good lines and
humor, here and there, enough to make the film mildly diverting, if you
are into watching this film for something else besides the action
scenes.</P>
<P>But despite some attempts to make this a deeper than usual actioner,
Frankenheimer's film is just your typical actioner. What gives it a lift
and a sense of being something more than the thin story it really is, is
the beautiful camera work and moody colors of the cinematography; and,
the superb acting by a very capable cast. Without De Niro's presence
this film would have been less than a run-of-the-mill action film,
despite its excellent cinematography.</P>
<P>I also found that Pryce and  Skarsgard stood out in their villain roles.
And Katrina Witt was a welcome relief from all the hard action scenes.
It was good to watch her perform with grace and beauty on skates. She
played the Russian figure skater who gets shot while performing. It
didn't make sense; but, then again, nothing really made sense in this
film.</P>
<P>Frankenheimer has fallen off the precipice from his glory days of the
'60s and '70s. I admired his MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (62) and FRENCH
CONNECTION 11 (75) for the raw power of their stories and their keen
insights into his characters' behavior.Unfortunately, this film is not
of the same caliber. It fails to make us think that what is taking place
is anything but absurd; and, that is the shame of it.This once great
filmmaker, in his prime, always seemed to provide us with both
thoughtful and suspenseful films that had some depth to them; while this
film, is at best, only mildly diverting.</P>
