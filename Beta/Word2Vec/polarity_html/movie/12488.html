<P>     Low, gray clouds scud across the sky while the grass of a 
seemingly-endless plain ripples in response to the prompting of a spring 
breeze.  Thunder rumbles in the distance.  On another day, a bright sun 
gazes down on those same fields while cattle roam from horizon to 
horizon.  The silhouette of a lone cowboy on horseback stands out 
against an evening skyline.  Above these vistas, the Rocky Mountains 
tower like implacable guardians, seeing all.  These are only some of the 
images from THE HORSE WHISPERER, a film as rich in its visual 
presentation as it is in its emotional resonance.</P>
<P>     As directed by veteran actor/film maker Robert Redford, THE HORSE 
WHISPERER is a powerful and moving tale of love and loss that eschews 
melodramatic manipulation in its pursuit of a simple, honest tale.  I 
have not read the best-selling novel by Nicholas Evans upon which the 
movie is based, but if it's as good as (or better than) the motion 
picture adaptation, it's easy to understand its appeal.  As a director, 
Redford has made some impressive films; this is among his best. </P>
<P>     THE HORSE WHISPERER opens peacefully enough, with two teenage girls 
leaving their houses in the early morning hours for a horseback ride.  
The sunrise is brilliant, and, as snow begins to fall later in the day, 
the fields and forest are turned into a winter wonderland of blues and 
silvers.  Everything is picture perfect until tragedy strikes, brutally 
and without warning.  One of the girls' mounts loses his footing on the 
icy ground and, suddenly, the two friends are in the path of a skidding 
18-wheeler.  One girl and her horse die.  The other pair, Grace MacLean 
(Scarlett Johansson), and her beloved steed, Pilgrim, are badly injured.  
Grace loses the lower half of one leg.  Pilgrim is driven mad, and 
everyone advises that he be put to sleep.</P>
<P>     Grace's parents, Annie and Robert MacLean (Kristin Scott Thomas and 
Sam Neill), are ill-prepared to help their daughter cope with her 
physical disability and the mental scars of having seen her best friend 
run down by an out-of-control truck.  Annie decides that Grace's 
recovery will be aided if she can find a way to heal Pilgrim (the film's 
only dubious contrivance).  So, with her daughter and the horse in tow, 
Annie heads out to Montana, where a legendary "horse whisperer," Tom 
Booker (Robert Redford), lives and works on a ranch.  After seeing 
Pilgrim, Tom agrees to try to help the horse, and so begins a long 
period of restoration for four souls:  Pilgrim, Grace, Annie, and Tom.</P>
<P>     Those of a romantic nature may focus on the understated 
relationship between Annie and Tom, but that's just one aspect of a 
story of great depth.  THE HORSE WHISPERER is about the healing power of 
love.  Like Atom Egoyan's masterpiece, THE SWEET HEREAFTER, this film 
eloquently illustrates how difficult it is to recover from a life-
altering trauma, and how the ripples from such an event can affect those 
who were not directly involved.  </P>
<P>     Everyone in this film has their own demons to wrestle with.  Grace, 
who retreats into a sullen cocoon after the accident, is raw on the 
inside, but won't let it out.  She resents her mother's emotional 
distance and is frightened that the loss of her leg makes her useless 
and will doom her to a life alone.  ("Nobody will want me like this!")  
Annie, who is used to being in charge, doesn't know how to cope with the 
situation, and, when she takes the time to examine her life, she 
recognizes how the pressures of her career have leeched away her 
humanity.  Meanwhile, Tom, who is basically at peace with himself, 
begins to re-discover what it means to love, something he had lost when 
his wife left him.</P>
<P>     There is an Oscar-caliber performance in THE HORSE WHISPERER, but 
it isn't given by Redford, Scott-Thomas, or Neill.  Instead, it's the 
work of young Scarlett Johansson, who has already proven her talent with 
a remarkable debut in MANNY & LO.  As Grace, Johansson makes a case to 
be placed alongside Christina Ricci and Natalie Portman as one of the 
best actresses of her generation.  She does everything necessary to make 
Grace a living and vital character, and, like all good performers, much 
of her acting comes through subtle expression changes and body language.  
Johansson is so effective, in fact, that Grace's story becomes THE HORSE 
WHISPERER's emotional core, not just a plot device whereby Tom and Annie 
find themselves and one another.</P>
<P>     Redford's Tom is exactly the kind of character we expect from 
Redford:  a solid, kind, rugged man who is long on patience and rarely 
displays much emotion.  It could be argued that the former matinee idol 
is a little too old for this sort of role, but, even with his features 
growing wrinkled and weathered, the camera still flatters him.  Kristin 
Scott Thomas makes a worthy opposite:  she's attractive (but not so 
stunning that she steals the spotlight away from her older co-star), 
mature, and a good actress.  Solid support is provided by the always-
reliable Sam Neill, Chris Cooper (LONE STAR), and Dianne Wiest.  </P>
<P>     Emotionally, THE HORSE WHISPERER finds the perfect pitch.  There's 
no overacting and no overt audience manipulation; we feel with and for 
the characters, but there's never a sense that we're being tricked into 
providing a particular, desired response.  The film is neither 
relentlessly downbeat nor needlessly cheerful; it's about healing, but 
there is a strong, bittersweet current running through the love story 
subplot.</P>
<P>     As a director, Redford has never shown greater mastery of his 
material.  His presentation of Montana, with all of its glorious open 
spaces, is enough to make anyone in the theater think about heading 
west.  He also manages to make the day-to-day activities of running a 
ranch and working with horses seem interesting.  At the outset, I feared 
that I might be bored by THE HORSE WHISPERER, but, despite the running 
length (which creeps close to TITANIC territory with no shipwreck in 
sight), I found myself thoroughly absorbed.  The presentation of the 
truck accident is memorable for the way in which it is staged -- it's 
loud, horrifying, and chaotic.  The editing and cinematography are 
perfect, and fashion an unforgettable cinematic moment.</P>
<P>     Speaking of cinematography, it's necessary to say a few words about 
Richard Richardson's work, which is effective throughout.  As good as 
Richardson is in photographing the sky and land, and presenting 
instances in silhouette, he is no less accomplished in capturing the 
nuances of small moments -- a quick smile here, a studied glance there.  
Most capable cinematographers would be hard-pressed not to make a shot 
of the Rocky Mountains look impressive; Richardson does as much with his 
photography of the characters as he does with the setting.</P>
<P>     Redford, along with screenwriters Richard LaGravenese and Eric 
Roth, has made a significant change to the ending of the story as 
presented in the novel.  But, while die-hard fans of Evans' book may be 
disappointed by the alteration, which significantly dampens the level of 
melodrama, it fits perfectly with the delicately-balanced tale and 
characters Redford has brought to the screen.  Every summer, it seems 
that there is at least one literate, intelligent alternative to the 
mindless blaze of action films.  For the early season of 1998, it's THE 
HORSE WHISPERER.  GODZILLA may be bigger, but for those who care about 
plot and character, and who want to experience a genuine emotional 
response, this is the real giant.</P>
