<P>The thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject 
directly at the core of "Leila," a powerfully articulated and subtle 
drama from famous Iranian director Dariush Mehrjui, that is his first 
motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain U.S. 
distribution, thanks to First Run Features. Although unfamiliar with 
Mehrjui's previous directing efforts, perhaps the reason for this is 
that, while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own 
country, the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the 
characters can easily be understood by all viewers.</P>
<P>Set in modern-day Iran, "Leila" begins on the birthday of the title 
character (Leila Hatami), after a brief prologue in which we are shown 
the first encounter between Leila and her future husband, Reza (Ali 
Mosaffa). As Leila and Reza set off to visit his parents, and then hers, 
where a birthday celebration has been planned, things seem rosy for the 
couple on the outside, but for Leila, life isn't quite as sweet. </P>
<P>Earlier, on that very same day, Leila had gone to see her physician, and 
has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever 
conceiving a child. When all of the conditions are ruled out, and Leila 
passes up the possibility of adoption, Reza firmly and lovingly tells 
her that he married her, and doesn't care at all about having children. 
Nonetheless, Leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a 
baby, which is the societal norm, and her self-esteem is not helped at 
all by her domineering mother-in-law (Jamileh Sheikhi), whose hopes to 
carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news (Reza is 
her only son). Bluntly explaining to Leila that Reza has always wished 
for children and, in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition, 
she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with. Leila 
hesitantly agrees, and while she and Reza are able to shallowly laugh 
afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies, Reza finally does 
meet a woman whom he claims to like, even though he refuses to go 
through with the marriage if Leila doesn't give her full blessing. </P>
<P>There are no easy answers to be found within "Leila," a film that 
thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight, as 
well as the inner workings of Leila herself, told through matter-of-fact 
narration. Almost completely taken over by her own shame, she has no 
option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests, even 
though she is unsure of how she will react if Reza really does end up 
marrying another woman. Maybe because "Leila" is from Iran, the film 
will unquestionably be shocking for American audiences, since the 
concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less 
everyday occurrence. Leila, however, is unable to come to terms with the 
idea quite as easily, but feels it is her duty to make her husband 
happy, no matter what the circumstances.</P>
<P>One of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the 
relationship between Leila and Reza, who married only three months after 
their first meeting, but obviously love each other very deeply. It is 
this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the 
opening scenes all the more powerful, and director Mehrjui has succeeded 
just about as well as possible. Although seemingly unimportant at first 
glance, an early sequence where Leila and Reza are eating dinner and 
both are laughing, nearly uncontrollably, actually is one of the most 
vital moments in the first half, as it unmistakably sets the boundary 
for their unrequisite love for one another. Ditto for another scene in 
which Reza gives Leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday, and then 
reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her. These "small" 
moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn, outraging sequences in 
the latter half, in which Reza drops Leila off at the side of a busy 
road, and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman. Left there 
to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage, foolishly unbeknownst to 
Reza, Leila prays each time that the date will not go well, so she will 
be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer. </P>
<P>Refusing to stay over at her parent's house, the film inevitably leads 
up to the second wedding night between Reza and another woman, and in a 
sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency, Leila finds her whole 
being emotionally torn apart, as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom 
as the marriage proceedings are going on down below. Despite her initial 
agreement to such a thing, Leila realizes how much she has been betrayed 
by Reza, whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him. 
Sure, the whole second marriage was his mother's idea, but if he really 
did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any 
children, then he could have still easily backed out, couldn't he?</P>
<P>In the pivotal role of Leila, who appears in every scene, Leila Hatami 
is nothing short of remarkable, injecting her character with an equal 
measure of startling strength, unavoidable vulnerability, and utter 
despair. Unlike most American films, in which everything always has to 
be spelled out for audiences, Hatami says much more with just an elusive 
expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words. 
Every bit a perfect match for Hatami is Ali Mosaffa, as Reza, a man who, 
I believe, does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife, but is too naive 
to realize what he will be doing to Leila if he marries someone else.</P>
<P>For all of its strong aspects, "Leila" isn't a perfect film. On a 
technical level, I found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes 
within the subtitles that need to be fixed. And concerning the plot 
developments, the final five minutes ring false when compared with 
everything that has come before. Mehrjui's decision to use an extremely 
stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice, particularly in 
his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful 
mother-in-law, played memorably by Jamileh Sheikhi.</P>
<P>Despite these minor missteps, "Leila" is an important motion picture 
that should definately be sought out upon its limited May 16 release at 
New York's Cinema Village, and then on May 21 in LA. The 
thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly 
with its uneasy morales, and when the climax arrives, Leila's self-worth 
is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete 
devastation, to which there is no return. It's difficult to not consider 
how Leila's culminating interior demise could have been so simply 
avoided, had the other characters taken a second out of their own 
selfish lives to consider what Leila, the major pawn in the unforgivable 
scheme, was going through.</P>
