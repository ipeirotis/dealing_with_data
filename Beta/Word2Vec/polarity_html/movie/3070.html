<PRE>                                   OLEANNA
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  William H. Macy, Debra Eisenstadt.
Screenplay/Director:  David Mamet.</P>
<P>     The advertising campaign for OLEANNA features the line, "Whatever
side you take, you're wrong."  Behind that statement is the conceit
that this adaptation of David Mamet's play, and by extension the
original play itself, is a balanced presentation of a controversial
issue.  It is not.  Whatever OLEANNA might be--provocative,
infuriating, incendiary--it is not balanced; it is a technically
proficient but inaccessible piece of reactionary agit-prop.  There are
two fine performances at the center of the film, but it was impossible
for me to separate them from Mamet's smug attempt to pass this off as
thought-provoking theater.</P>
<P>     OLEANNA is essentially a study of two characters:  an unnamed
professor (William H. Macy) at an unnamed college, and Carol (Debra
Eisenstadt), one of his students.  Carol, having just received a very
poor mid-term grade in the professor's social sciences class, comes to
his office to find out what she can do to improve her grade.  Though
the professor is extremely busy, he decides to try to explain some of
the concepts of the class to Carol, in a session that occasionally
becomes quite emotional.  The next day, the professor is stunned to
discover that Carol has charged him with inappropriate conduct--in
effect, sexual harrassment--during their encounter.  When he
confronts her, she attempts to show him how power has corrupted him,
though he isn't even aware of it.</P>
<P>     Those familiar with David Mamet's elliptical dialogue will
instantly recognize OLEANNA as his work; those unfamiliar with it will
wonder what the heck he's trying to do.  The staccato rhythms don't
sound conversational, and in fact sometimes seem even more stagey than
conventional stage dialogue.  But though the first act of OLEANNA is
occasionally very rough going, there is something compelling about that
dialogue.  I found myself paying closer attention, and noticing
recurring motifs and shifting roles.  William H. Macy, who originated
the role of the professor on Broadway, has a gift for making Mamet's
words sound as close to natural as they can, and gives a haunting and
haunted performance.  Debra Eisenstadt is also impressive, alternately
cowering and commanding, but the words sound more forced in her mouth.
Unfortunately, that is symptomatic of what is really wrong with her
role.</P>
<P>     Here, then, is where OLEANNA becomes truly insidious.  The
conflict between Carol and the professor, as it plays out in the second
and third acts, becomes one largely of interpretation.  Has the
professor, by virtue of the power inherent in his position, placed
Carol in a compromising position, or is Carol reacting too much in
accord with a pre-determined agenda?  Mamet pretends to make a case for
both sides, but in reality he has done no such thing.  Though Carol
talks a good talk bout how the professor has wronged her, and attempts
to make her case both to him and to the audience, the way Carol is
portrayed makes her completely unreliable.  In the first act, she is
deferrent to the point of neurosis, taking copious notes which it is
later suggested might have been part of a plan to bring him down;
later, she makes repeated references to an unnamed "group," a
presumably radical campus organization to which she belongs and has as
its insignia a pseudo-swastika design.  At this point, while Carol
speaks wearing this insignia on her lapel, nothing that Carol says can
be taken seriously, even if we are inclined to thing that we may be
seeing events through our own prejudiced lenses.  When the voice for
one side of an argument is presented as a devastated family man, and
the voice for the other side is a caricature of a fascist, the author
surrenders the right to claim that he is being balanced.</P>
<P>     Issues of politics aside, OLEANNA just doesn't connect beyond a
level of detached technical admiration.  Perhaps seeing the play live,
where post-performance discussions were almost always part of the
experience, provided more immediacy, more intensity.  On the big
screen, for all its controversy, OLEANNA is just too cold and
intellectualized.</P>
<P>     Mamet expressed concern when audiences at advance screenings
cheered when the professor struck Carol.  I think that reaction might
inspire Mamet to take a good, long look at the messages he is sending.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 power trips:  4.</PRE>
