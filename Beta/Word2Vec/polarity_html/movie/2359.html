<PRE>                             THREE COLORS: BLUE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring: Juliette Binoche, Benoit Regent, Charlotte Very.
Screenplay:  Krzysztof Kieslowski & Krzysztof Piesiewicz.
Director:  Krzysztof Kieslowski.</P>
<P>     I can't claim that my experience with French films has been all
that extensive, but the limited experience I have had has lent itself
to the following stereotypical image:  two characters sitting in a
dimly lit cafe, smoking cigarettes and speaking cryptically to one
another in extremely muted tones.  These films tended to deal with
emotionally stunted people in an emotionally stunted manner,
potentially intriguing but inert, if not downright soporific.  It
caused me no end of amusement to find a scene exactly like the one I
just described in Krzysztof Kieslowski's THREE COLORS: BLUE.  It caused
me more pleasure to discover that scene only one part of a complex and
fascinating character study of grief, directed with a mesmerizing
grace.  So now I wonder...is it French cinema that has changed, or is
it me?</P>
<P>     THREE COLORS: BLUE opens with a car crash which claims the life of
renowned composer Patrice de Courcy and his five-year-old daughter,
leaving wife Julie (Juliette Binoche) as the only survivor.  Julie
first considers suicide, but eventually decides to sever all ties with
her previous life and move into a small flat in Paris.  There she
wishes nothing more than to spend the rest of her days doing nothing,
free of the loves and friendships she describes as "traps."  However,
she finds that freedom difficult, as she develops a friendship with
neighbor Lucille (Charlotte Very).  When her husband's former partner
Olivier (Benoit Regent) goes public with his intention to complete
Patrice's unfinished final concerto, Julie is forced to confront facts
which might finally shake her from her reverie.</P>
<P>     From a narrative standpoint, BLUE is not the most easily
accessible of films.  There is very little dialogure, in fact very
little sound of any kind; even the car crash is notable for its
understatement.  Only the occasional explosions of Zbigniew Preisner's
score tend to break the silence, loading the music with significance.
Kieslowski chooses to allow us into Julie's world almost entirely
through images, but how arresting those images are.  In one scene,
Julie sits in a cafe and listens to a street musician playing one of
Patrice's compostions; Kieslowski indicates how long she stays simply
through the changing shadows cast by Julie's coffee cup.  Another scene
shows Julie standing in her flat as a man runs down the hall banging on
doors, seeking help while being chased, apparently by muggers.  It's a
confident but rarely showy directing job by Kieslowski, allowing
Julie's story to unfold slowly and clearly.</P>
<P>     The centerpiece of BLUE is the performance of Juliette Binoche as
Julie, and it's a winner.  While not the type of performance American
film audiences are used to seeing, it is nonetheless extremely
effective.  Like many characters we saw in 1993, Julie tries to make
herself safe by placing herself in an emotional vacuum, but she betrays
her natural inclinations to reach out in scenes with her elderly mother
and with Lucille.  At times the role might appear one-note, yet there
are deeper shadings.  The early scene in which Julie sleeps with
Olivier simply to provide him with closure to his previously unrequited
love is strangely emotional.  and her physical response to a group of
young girls coming into the pool where she is swimming packs a punch.
Binoche proves herself as deserving as any actor this year of Oscar
consideration.</P>
<P>     Where BLUE is likely to irritate many is in the deliberate
opaquity of some of its images.  Julie's reaction to the discovery of a
nest of mice in her apartment never really connects, nor do the images
of bungee jumping.  A scene between Julie and the young man who
witnessed the car crash seems repetitive, relevant only for the
introduction of an object which will later prove significant.  BLUE
proves to be very slow going at times, and requires immense patience.
However, as details concerning the relationship between Julie and
Patrice unfold, such patience will be proved worthwhile.  THREE
COLORS:  BLUE is an intensely focused examination of one woman's
attempt at self-deception for her own perceived good, and will likely
stick with me for some time.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 shades of blue:  8.</PRE>
