<PRE>                                THE SPECIALIST
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:  Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, James Woods, Eric
Roberts, Rod Steiger.
Screenplay:  Alexandra Seros.
Director:  Luis Llosa.</PRE>
<P>     There are moments in this job when one is faced with separating
the "so-bad-it's-entertaining" from the "just-plain-awful."  At those
times, I wish I could become Joe Bob Briggs, and make the
recommendation to "check it out" based simply on explosions, naked
breasts and Cuban gangster-fu.  But THE SPECIALIST doesn't deserve such
consideration.  Ponderous, pretentious and acted with astounding
indifference, THE SPECIALIST is a big fat bore with a couple of nice
explosions.  It's too somber to work as camp, and too tedious to work
as anything else.</P>
<P>     Sylvester Stallone stars as Ray Quick, a former CIA demolitions
expert now haunted by his past and hiring out his skills with
explosives freelance.  He is contacted by May Munro (Sharon Stone), a
woman obsessed with the murder of her parents at the hands of three
thugs led by Tomas (Eric Roberts), the son of a Miami drug lord (Rod
Steiger).  Ray is unsure whether he wants to take the job, until he
becomes a bit too personally interested in May's attempts to get closer
to Tomas.  He also discovers that the drug lord's head of security is
Ned Trent (James Woods), Ray's former CIA partner.  Trent carries a
ten-year grudge for Ray's part in having him thrown out of the Agency,
and plans to use May's vendetta to exact a little vengeance of his
own.</P>
<P>     Much as one might expect, THE SPECIALIST is being hyped on the
pairing of box-office heavyweights Stallone and Stone.  Unfortunately,
both of them spend most of the film looking as though they've just done
a NyQuil highball.  Stone swaggers through discos in slow motion,
wanders through her inexplicably massive house in slow motion, has sex
in slow motion.  At some point, director Luis Llosa needed to explain
to Stone that "haunted" and "bored" are entirely different emotions.
Stallone is even more comatose, conveying Ray's deep reservoir of
anguish and guilt through drooping eyelids and jaw muscle isometrics,
as well as speaking in what can only be described as an impersonation
of Henry Kissinger with a head cold.  Perhaps that was one of the
reasons behind a scene in which Stallone dispatches a group of young
hoods on a bus, which was added after test screenings:  they needed at
least some evidence that he had a pulse.</P>
<P>     The rest of the cast is nearly as bad.  James Woods tries to cut
loose as the demented Trent, but he never makes for a particularly
threatening villain.  He's better when humiliating a bomb squad
commander or making off-handed insults about a loud shirt.  Eric
Roberts, typecast for most of his career as a lout-mouthed sleazeball,
plays...well, a slightly more sedate sleazeball, delivering lines like
"What I want, I take" straight out of the Introduction to Basic
Machismo Handbook.  And Rod Steiger, who was given to overacting even
in his Academy Award-winning heyday, is appalling as the Cuban
Godfather, doing an accent which rivals Kevin Costner's Robin Hood as
the worst in recent memory.</P>
<P>     There are a couple of moments in THE SPECIALIST which are worth
unintentional giggles.  One is the ill-advised scene in which Stallone
and Stone stand together in a hotel room, undressing each other while
Stone stares down at the top of the 5'8" Stallone's head.  Another is
trying to understand how Stone's May, who looks about ten years older
than Roberts' Tomas, was supposed to be a young girl when an adult
Roberts helped kill May's parents.  But THE SPECIALIST is simply
brain-dead from top to bottom.  There are almost too many examples of
stupidity to single one out, but my personal favorite involves May
faking her own death by tossing her wallet in with a 60-year-old
corpse.  Apparently they don't have photos on ID in Florida.</P>
<P>     I have to hand the pyrotechnics team credit for blowing up a hotel
suite; it's a fairly impressive piece of work.  But that's when I
should have left.  Come to think of it, I wish that's where I'd come
in, too.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 specialists:  1.</PRE>
