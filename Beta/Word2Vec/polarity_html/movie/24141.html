DEATHTRAP (director: Sidney Lumet; screenwriter: Jay Presson Allen/from
the play of Ira Levin; cinematographer: Andrzej Bartkowiak; editor: John
J. Fitzstephens; cast: Michael Caine (Sidney Bruhl), Christopher Reeve
(Clifford Anderson), Dyan Cannon (Myra Bruhl), Irene Worth (Helga Ten
Dorp), Henry Jones (Porter Milgrim), 1982)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A verbose talk-fest, which is a play more than a visual film experience,
as adapted by Sidney Lumet from Ira Levin's Broadway play about a parlor
murder game. Lumet as always, sucks any subtlety out of his films. Here
he is in a bit of a frenzy in portraying the characters, relying more on
plot twists than character development. In comparison with a
similar-type of stage play put to the silver screen, Joseph L.
Mankiewicz's Sleuth, Lumet's is clearly the inferior one.</P>
<P>The film centers around the Michael Caine character Sidney Bruhl, a once
successful mystery playwright, who at the age of 46, has lost his
ability to write. He is tired of living off his wealthy wife, Myra
(Cannon), in their spacious and attractive East Hampton home. When his
latest Broadway play flops, his fourth such disaster in a row, he
returns home drunk and depressed, but tells his wife that a student in
one of his writing seminars sent him a brilliant manuscript that he
would kill for. At first, Myra thinks he is joking about killing for the
play, but when he tells her this student, whom he doesn't even remember
what he looks like, Clifford Anderson (Reeves), "has written a play that
is so good, even a gifted director couldn't hurt it," and to make
matters even better, he is a loner who has no other copies of the
manuscript. She begins to think, maybe he isn't joking, that he actually
might kill for a hit play.</P>
<P>The story builds in suspense when the cheery Clifford arrives in their
house to go over the play with his former teacher and Sidney carries out
his plan to kill him by trickily getting him to handcuff himself with
his souvenir Houdini handcuffs and then strangling him with another prop
from one of his plays. Myra tried to stop him, but could only helplessly
scream, feeling repelled that her husband could do something like that
but is unwilling to turn him over to the cops. At this point, the film
had a fluidity and a macabre comical tone to it. But, it changes in a
drastically different direction, and the surprises in the plot, from
here on, come about faster than a Venice Beach skateboarder trying to
impress the bystanders.</P>
<P>Removing Clifford's body, with his reluctant wife's help, the Bruhl's
are about to retire for the night, when a nosy neighbor, Helga Ten Dorp
(Worth), a visitor from Holland who is staying with the family next
door, pays them a visit. She also happens to be a psychic and senses
something is wrong in the house; she feels pain everywhere, especially
in the study-area, where Sidney keeps his mementos from his other plays,
which include guns, knives, and swords. The psychic clearly sees dangers
ahead and warns the couple to leave the house, she is especially fearful
about what will happen to Myra.</P>
<P>What eventually shines through, is how clever and manipulative the
script is. I felt used by the characterizations, as it took away a lot
of the pleasure derived from the snappy dialogue and the absurdity of
the storyline, that in the first act, worked really well. Caine seemed
marvelous at first, but I soon tired of his constantly frantic look. It
was Dyan Cannon, with her sweet giggles and frustrated looks, who
brought a needed restraint to the film, and as long as she was onscreen
the film had an edge to it. Too many contrivances made everything seem
so superficial, which is a shame, because the film did have its funny
moments.</P>
