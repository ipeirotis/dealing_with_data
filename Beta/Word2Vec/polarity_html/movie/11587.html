<P>     It would be possible to write pages and pages comparing and 
contrasting the reality of Bill Clinton's 1992 Presidential campaign 
with the fictional one of Jack Stanton, the candidate in PRIMARY COLORS.  
Likewise, it would be equally possible to develop a lengthy piece about 
the similarities and differences between the movie and the best-selling 
novel upon which it is based.  Since more qualified individuals than I 
will be penning articles of this sort over the next few days and weeks, 
I feel confident that I can narrow the scope of this review (mostly) to 
the movie itself, and let others worry about the divisions between fact 
and fiction.</P>
<P>     Of course, it's impossible not to note that many of the characters 
in the film bear a striking resemblance to certain counterparts in the 
Clinton camp.  Equally noteworthy is the fact that the movie 
dopplegangers are portrayed more kindly their respective book 
incarnations.  This is partially the result of the direction in which 
director Mike Nichols (THE GRADUATE, THE BIRDCAGE) has chosen to take 
the film.  Joe Klein's novel (which he published under the "Anonymous" 
pseudonym) is a cynical satire about life on the campaign trail.  It's 
harsh, blistering, and possesses an edge that the film, a warmhearted 
comedy/drama, lacks.  And, while the motion picture still makes some 
rather uncomfortable points about the sacrifices of virtue necessary to 
win an election, its approach is much gentler than that of the book, or, 
for that matter, another recent movie, WAG THE DOG, or the documentary, 
THE WAR ROOM.</P>
<P>     There's merit in briefly running through the film's major 
characters and identifying their real-life counterparts, if only to 
satisfy the curiosity of those who have seen the picture and aren't 
sure.  Jack and Susan Stanton (John Travolta and Emma Thompson) are, of 
course, Bill and Hilary Clinton.  The movie's central figure, whose soul 
becomes a battleground between politics and idealism, is Henry Burton 
(Adrian Lester), a black version of George Stephanopoulos.  Richard 
Jemmons (Billy Bob Thornton), a plain-speaking spin doctor, is obviously 
James Carville.  Campaign adviser Daisy Green (Maura Tierney) represents 
Mandy Grunwald, and dirt-digger Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) exhibits 
similarities to Betsey Wright.  There's also a Gennifer Flowers-type 
named Cashmire McLeod (Gia Carides) and a Paul Tsongas stand-in, 
Lawrence Harris (Kevin Cooney).  </P>
<P>     In a nutshell, the film follows a Democratic presidential candidate 
from the early days of his campaign, when he's preparing for the New 
Hampshire primary, to the vanquishing of his final opponent.  Governor 
Jack Stanton, who is charisma personified, wins over voters as a result 
of his relaxed manner, apparent empathy with his audience, and 
refreshingly open approach. ("I'm gonna do something really outrageous -
- tell the truth," he declares at one point.  The irony of that 
statement, I'm sure, is not lost on anyone.)  But Jack has a number of 
skeletons in his closet, many of which are associated with sexual 
indiscretions, and his advisors work overtime to keep them concealed.  </P>
<P>     Not everything in PRIMARY COLORS is stripped from the historical 
account of Clinton '92.  One of the key players in the film, Fred Picker 
(Larry Hagman), the "miracle candidate," has no real-life counterpart.  
In addition, much of what transpires during the closing half-hour has 
little or no basis in fact.  It's purely Klein's invention, as filtered 
through Elaine May's script.  Likewise, the resolution of the Cashmire 
McLeod situation is radically different from how things turned out with 
Gennifer Flowers.  </P>
<P>     However, while the film is smart and perceptive in its take on 
American politics, it's dramatically weak.  Nichols frequently seems 
caught in a palpable quandary:  is this a satire, a drama, or a 
cautionary tale?  Because PRIMARY COLORS vacillates uncertainly between 
the three, it's not strong as any of them.  There's also a question of 
whether Nichols and May softened the book to avoid appearing too 
critical of the President.  Is PRIMARY COLORS an attack, a retreat, or 
an apology?</P>
<P>     My biggest complaint about the film is the length.  At 140 minutes, 
it's too long, with several sequences that border on becoming tedious.  
I also found Burton's constant moral struggles to be more irksome than 
believable.  Maybe I'm just too cynical, but I have trouble accepting 
that someone that deep in the political process would be beset by so 
many doubts.  (This, incidentally, was one of my complaints about THE 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT.)  Humanizing a character is one thing, but making 
him too noble, especially in a movie that has a satirical basis, can be 
problematic.  And, while the parallels between real individuals and 
fictional characters are interesting, they can't sustain a feature-
length motion picture on their own.</P>
<P>     Some of the problems inherent in adapting a book for the screen are 
evident as well.  Many crucial relationships (such as the one between 
Burton and Green) are left half-developed (we see the two in bed, but 
never really understand how they got to that point, or where they go 
afterwards).  Likewise, two-thirds of the way through, Green disappears 
with only a single-line write-out.  It's difficult to say where these 
elements were molded into their current form (i.e., in the screenwriting 
process or in the editing room), but, considering some of what survived 
in the final print, it makes for an uneven viewing experience.</P>
<P>     With one important exception, the performances are on-target.  
Travolta is wonderful as the Bill Clintonesque Stanton, with a Southern 
accent, white hair, a pot belly, and a boatload of charisma.  Emma 
Thompson, effectively shedding her British accent, creates a wonderfully 
human Susan, who loves her husband but erects an emotional shield to 
ward off being torn apart by his indiscretions.  Billy Bob Thornton, 
like James Carville, is a scene-stealer, as is Kathy Bates.  Solid 
support is provided by Maura Tierney, Larry Hagman, and Stacy Edwards 
(IN THE COMPANY OF MEN) as Holden's "assistant."  Unfortunately, I 
wasn't impressed by Adrian Lester's work, and, since the movie is 
presented from his perspective, this is a serious drawback.  Lester 
frequently seems stiff, and his performance is occasionally forced.  I 
was constantly aware that this is an actor playing a part, not a fully 
fleshed-out character.</P>
<P>     It will be interesting to see whether the fortuitous timing of this 
release boosts the box office numbers.  While there's nothing in the 
film that relates specifically to the recent allegations surrounding the 
President's sex life, there are at least as many parallels as in WAG THE 
DOG.  Jack Stanton is, after all, a noble, sincere man who genuinely 
wants to do good, but is impeded by an overactive libido.  And, as Klein 
will acknowledge (but Nichols and May will not), any coincidences are 
purely intentional.</P>
