<P>     I'm thinking of putting together a self-help book which would assist
talented performers trying to come to terms with making a terrible film.
I'd call it something like "Smart Actors, Foolish Choices," or maybe "Why
Bad Movies Happen to Good People."  Within its pages would be testemonials
and guidance, reminding the readers that they're not alone in making the
isolated career blunder.  Tom Hanks had his BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES,
Anthony Hopkins had his ROAD TO WELLVILLE, Michael Caine had...okay, bad
example.  For an actor wallowing in "What was I thinking?", the healing
could begin.</P>
<P>     Of course, my motives wouldn't be entirely altruistic.  My research
might also help me understand how films like KISS THE GIRLS come to pass.
Morgan Freeman, the most talented American actor in films, stars as Alex
Cross, a Washington, D.C. forensic psychologist investigatig the abduction
of his neice in North Carolina by a serial kidnapper calling himself
Casanova.  Ashley Judd, the most promising dramatic actress of her
generation, plays medical intern Kate McTiernan, who escapes from Casanova
and helps Cross with the investigation.  Somewhere in this trite,
uninspired psycho-thriller, two gifted actors found something worth
exploring.  I wish I could figure out what that thing was.</P>
<P>     It's not just that KISS THE GIRLS trots out the over-used serial
predator as its villain, or that it relies on a "surprising" revelation of
the villain's identity; both devices can be used effectively, and have
been in recent years.  KISS THE GIRLS doesn't work because there's no
reason to care about who Casanova is, what he does, or what he's going to
do.  Director Gary Fleder never generates any tension or simmering menace,
assuming that murky cinematography will do his work for him.  Perhaps he
spends so little time on the tone because he has a hard enough time
keeping the viewers focused on the basic facts of the plot.  Some of his
narrative leaps are utterly baffling, sending audience members into a
frenzy of muttered "Who's he's" and "Where are they now's."</P>
<P>     To be fair to Fleder, his directionless direction matches the
directionless script with which he's working.  The characters in KISS THE
GIRLS are so thinly defined that it never seems to be about anything but
plodding along until it's time to unmask Casanova, yet even that major
plot point is ineptly handled.  Screenwriter David Klass doesn't bother to
drop the faintest clue about who Casanova might be, to the extent that he
could have been picking a name out of a hat when Casanova finally shows
his face.  Worse still, Klass doesn't bother to explore the villain's
motives.  After all, there's something unique about a serial criminal
whose primary goal isn't murder.  Shouldn't we care _why_?</P>
<P>     The only bright spots in KISS THE GIRLS, not surprisingly, are the
performances by Freeman and Judd.  Freeman brings the weight of years to
every role he plays, radiating the wisdom of a man who has seen a lot and
learned from every bit of it.  Where there is only a body in a suit,
Freeman creates a character.  Judd has a bit more to work with as a strong
woman recovering from the trauma of abduction, and she injects plenty of
fear and determination into her scenes.  Even then, the script doesn't
pull us into Kate's emotions.  It's hard to believe there was anything on
the page which made these characters -- or this by-the-numbers story --
seem appealing, but Freeman and Judd took them on anyway.  Maybe these
parts were the best they could find.  Maybe they suffered severe brain
cramps at critical moments.  In either case, they need our support.  I
feel their pain...I had to _watch_ KISS THE GIRLS.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 killers' kisses:  4.</PRE>
