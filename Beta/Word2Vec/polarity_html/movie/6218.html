<P>     It's a bold proclamation to say that no film featuring the 
incomparable Jeanne Moreau can be all bad, but, given the evidence of 
some of the mediocre material redeemed by the actress (THE SUMMER HOUSE, 
for example), it's hard to refute.  THE PROPRIETOR is a real test of her 
skills, and it's a testament to her talent and screen presence that she 
somehow manages to render this muddled, uneven film watchable.  This may 
not be vintage Moreau, but it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that she 
still has what it takes to capture audiences.</P>
<P>     I wish I could say that the quality of the script equals Moreau's 
performance, but it doesn't.  This is a terribly disjointed piece of 
writing that combines all sorts of bizarre elements into a fragmented 
whole.  About a third of the time, I had no idea what was going on.  
Characters are inserted without an introduction, and we're supposed to 
recognize their importance immediately.  Whole scenes appear to have 
been cut out.  Transitions, when they exist, are often jarring.  There's 
certainly a problem with the editing, but the more fundamental flaw lies 
in the basic incoherence of the screenplay.</P>
<P>     Moreau plays Adrienne Mark, a once-revered French writer who, in 
her twilight years, is living an unfulfilling existence in New York 
City.  Back in 1960, she wrote a novel, JE M'APPELLE FRANCE, that became 
an international best-seller.  It was turned into a critically-lauded 
movie that "changed the way we look at women."  More than a decade 
later, the film was re-made by Hollywood as a trashy, market-grabber 
called CALL ME FRENCH.  And, though her best years as a writer are 
behind her, Adrienne is still remembered for those films.  Movie buffs 
like William O'Hara (Josh Hamilton) adore the former while big-time 
producers like Virginia Kelly (Sean Young) applaud the latter.</P>
<P>     The story gets moving when Adrienne learns that her childhood home 
in France, where she lived until her Jewish mother (Charlotte De 
Turckheim) was taken by the Gestapo, is up for auction.  Selling all of 
her worldly possessions with the help of an art dealer (Sam Waterston), 
Adrienne attempts to acquire enough cash to register the highest bid on 
the Paris apartment.  In making the trip across the Atlantic, she 
discovers that there's more to confronting her guilt-laden memories than 
simply coming home.  And, as a cache of hidden letters reveals, her 
perception of the events following her mother's capture may be terribly 
wrong.</P>
<P>     When the film focuses on Adrienne's attempts to placate her 
personal ghosts, it's reasonably involving, but, ultimately, THE 
PROPRIETOR is hamstrung by far too many unsuccessful tangents.  The most 
interesting of these involves Virginia's attempts to remake a black-and-
white French classic into a mainstream Hollywood movie.  (DIABOLIQUE, 
anyone?)  While this touches on some of the issues that divide art from 
mainstream entertainment, it's a shallow and cursory examination that is 
ultimately dropped in favor of a cute, fantasy-like romance between the 
brash Virginia and her sensitive French partner (Marc Tissot).  </P>
<P>     Aside from Moreau, there's no one here who delivers a memorable 
performance, and some of the acting is downright awful.  Sean Young, 
feeding on her off-screen image, does a nice job as a caricature, but, 
when the script demands that Virginia show signs of character 
development, the actress runs into trouble.  Josh Hamilton and Marc 
Tissot are flat.  Sam Waterston, Nell Carter (as Adrienne's maid), and 
Austin Pendleton (as an eccentric European living in America and 
sporting a terrible accent) are unimpressive in small roles.  Maybe the 
problem is that the actors were as confused by the script's treatment of 
their characters as we are.</P>
<P>     This is the second consecutive disappointing effort from director 
Ismail Merchant (his debut, IN CUSTODY, was more cerebral, but not any 
better), indicating perhaps that he should stick to producing.  And, 
combining his lack of success with the two most recent lackluster 
pictures (JEFFERSON IN PARIS, SURVIVING PICASSO) from his partner, James 
Ivory, the tarnish on the once-venerated name of Merchant-Ivory is 
beginning to show.</P>
