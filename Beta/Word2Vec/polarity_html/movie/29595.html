<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A superficial scare film that makes a feeble attempt to serve up Hamlet as its
theme, but that's a stretch. It's about a 16-year-old girl, Ruby Baker (Leelee
Sobieski), and her much younger brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan), who become
orphaned when their Encino, California, parents (Michael O'Keefe and Rita
Wilson) are killed in an auto accident. </P>
<P>They are vulnerable and a deceitful Malibu couple takes advantage of them, as
Terry and Erin (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), supposedly close friends of
their parents, become their guardians. Somehow there are no family members to
take them in and it's also most peculiar that the kids don't know the Glasses;
but, nevertheless, they are turned over to this seemingly wealthy couple living
in an ultra-modern glass house overlooking a cliff. Their estate lawyer,
Begleiter (Bruce Dern), who is their adviser, says that's what their folks
wanted and they would be wards of the state otherwise. He spends about two
seconds with Ruby and drops that news on her like a bombshell, and then hands
her his business card; he then offers her nothing else but to tell her that her
parents were thrifty and left the kids enough money so that they would never
have to worry about money. It didn't seem believable. He was certainly no bundle
of warmth in their hour of need! </P>
<P>It's a film that is devoid of subtlety as its shocks are not surprising and its
unfulfilling revenge ending in terms of 'An Eye For Eye' was poorly scripted; it
also failed to be convincing or scary. It was just another mindless slasher
film. </P>
<P>The Glasses put on a false front of being genuinely nice people when the kids
move in, but it soon becomes apparent that they are a creepy couple with
ulterior motives. The film spends most of its time showing the couple pretending
to be nice but still looking creepy. They do not even give the kids separate
rooms in the large house they have, as they are only able to keep Rhett
unconcerned about his situation by buying him off with video games. </P>
<P>The usual bag of clichéd scare tricks are carried out before Ruby learns that
the businessman in a car transit service business is in deep trouble financially
because he took out a million dollar loan from some gangster loan sharks that he
can't pay back, that his doctor wife is a drug addict, that he rigged the car
her parents died in, and that she and her brother are in deep trouble staying in
that house. It also shows there are no adults she can turn to for help and that
all the institutions in place to service such situations, such as the schools
and social welfare department, are no guarantee that help is on the way. </P>
<P>The film has a cold and steely look to it, as feelings on everyone's part are
chilly. Ruby is a hard one to warm up to, as she's always wired for hostility,
while her brother seems to be a slave to video games and has no personality. The
house itself is smothered in a cold, aqua blue, as the production designer, Jon
Gary Steele, and the director of photography, Alar Kivilo, have made the set to
look like a clone of the antagonistic and cold-hearted Terry Glass. This kind of
coldness lasted too long onscreen, as the film was trapped in its one-note of
suspense--Will the kids get away from the evil couple who want to rob them and
also kill Ruby? There was no suspense because if you ever watched any of these
formulaic flicks then you will know how this one ends. The film's slow pace for
such a slight story bordered on criminality. </P>
<P>This is basically a film that put a great effort into getting the sets it wanted
to be right, but failed to get anything more out of this absurd tale. It was
never believable, but its conclusion was even more ridiculous than it had a
right to be. </P>
