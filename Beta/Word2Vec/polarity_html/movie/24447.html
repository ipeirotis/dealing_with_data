<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A far-fetched and schmaltzy Hollywood-style mainstream tale about time
travel. Frank Sullivan as played by Dennis Quaid, the man permanently
blessed with the benign Jack Nicholson smile, is a heroic firefighter
living in Bayside, Queens, which is a nice middle-class area with
private homes, one next to the other.</P>
<P>Frank died in a fire at an abandoned warehouse on October 12, 1969, but
hold onto your N.Y. Mets baseball cap for this one, his son makes
contact via a Heathkit ham radio (those cheap kind that were built from
a kit) with his deceased father on October 10, 1999. The son, John (Jim
Caviezel), is now 36-years-old and is a police homicide detective, still
living in the same house he was born in. The explanation for this
phenomena occurring, causing them to transmit via short-wave radio and
have contact with one another while not seeing each other even though
they are transmitting in the same house, is that there were two freak
electrical storms occurring thirty years apart during an aurora borealis
-- the Northern Lights -- which somehow interacted with the ham radio
and enabled them to communicate (right!). You are also asked to swallow
this additional pill: after confirming that he is speaking with his
father, he gives his dad information via the ham radio that will now
allow him to escape from the abandoned warehouse fire and avoid his
death.</P>
<P>To buy into this half-baked sci-fi wannabe, one has to have a suspension
of disbelief and of all rational thought.</P>
<P>The plot continues in this vein of time travel and tells how father and
son team up to stop a serial killer, altering events that already
happened by rewriting the past. If the catch-the-killer subplot had any
real suspense to it, I might have bit more for this nonsense storyline.
But that thriller part doesn't even hold up with your average TV
detective show. As a result, the film veers away from what made it so
appealing in the first place, a father and son who didn't know each
other have been given another chance through the ham radio, to have a
meaningful relationship. But this story is unfortunately overtaken by
its weak serial killer story. Thereby, the film is reduced to
overreaching its credibility by confusingly switching back and forth
between past and future events, sloppily changing one for the other,
until nothing made sense, since you have to keep changing both
simultaneously to alter both dimensions and the film fails to accomplish
that storyline with accurate details.</P>
<P>If you buy into the premise, which is the only way to sit through this
film, then you will be rewarded by the following subplots: a lot of
baseball nostalgia about those "Amazin'" Mets winning the 1969 World
Series; seeing an endearing relationship develop between father and son,
that is filled with mutual love; preventing the so-called Nightingale
serial killer the opportunity to kill all the 10 nurses he supposedly
killed, including John's mother; watching the NYFD in action fighting
fires; and, lastly, you might feel that there is hope even after death
of seeing your loved ones coming back as much as thirty years later and
even playing softball with you, which makes this the ultra in feel-good
movie. Oh, yeah, you also get tips on future stocks, like Yahoo!, which
you can take that inside time travel tip to your future stock broker and
eventually buy a Mercedes Benz with the killing you'll make in the
market.</P>
<P>The acting was surprisingly good, despite the poor script. Dennis Quaid
is a throwback father  -- one that many a child would gladly appreciate.
James Caviezel is convincing as a possible alcoholic, a moody workaholic
detective, and someone unhappy with his unmarried life, feeling that
there is something missing in his life. Able supporting roles are
provided by: "Homicide's" Andre Brougher as a detective--he is Frank's
best friend and John's current boss, Noah Emmerich is John's best friend
and neighbor from his childhood (he is the brother of the screenwriter),
Shawn Doyle makes for a creepy serial killer, and Elizabeth Mitchell
sweetly plays her one-dimensional role as Frank's wife Julia, a
wonderful mother to John, a dedicated nurse, and a potential victim of
the serial killer.</P>
<P>If the film did one thing right, it showed a family that was really
together and good to see on the screen, especially with all the recent
films mostly showing only dysfunctional families. It was refreshing to
see one for a change with a father as a good role model, even if some
might find this relationship too corny.</P>
<P>Gregory Hoblit (Primal Fear/Fallen) has fallen into the trap of going
overboard in his use of sentimentality, which overtakes the film and
makes it too gooey for comfort. Also, his directing suffers from an
inability to tell a good detective story, even if his idea on time
travel is intriguing. Unfortunately, the time travel story does not hold
up to any intelligent scrutiny. So what is left, is a movie that should
find its own audience with those who find the father/son relationship
meaningful and find the time travel concept to be entertaining.</P>
