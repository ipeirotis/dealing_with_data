<P>HOPE FLOATS (director: Forest Whitaker; cast: Sandra Bullock (Birdee
Pruitt), Harry Connick Jr. (Justin Matisse), Gena Rowlands (Ramona
Calvert), Mae Whitman (Bernice Pruitt), Michael Pare (Bill Pruitt),
Kathy Najimy (Toni Post), Rosanna Arquette (Friend), 1998)</P>
<P>Sandra Bullock as Birdee Pruitt, is the prom queen who learns on a
national tv talk show that her husband Bill (Pare) is having an affair
with her best friend (Arquette). She had been suckered into appearing
on the show thinking she was getting a makeover, and is startled to
see her friend and her husband blare it all out on the tube.This
crushes her. So she takes her daughter Bernice (Mae) and moves back in
with her eccentric mother Ramona Calvert (Gena) in a small town in
Texas. Birdee is pictured as the loyal and true wife, who married her
high school sweetheart and is left psychologically scarred by that
incident. She has lost the boldness she once had, and seems unsure of
herself for the first time in her life, as she is filled with
self-pity.  This very ordinary story is related in soap opera style,
evoking heart tugging sympathy for the victim. How could you not feel
sorry for her?</P>
<P>The Steven Rogers's script adds a bit of conflict to the story by
having the mother-daughter relationship be strained. But the conflict
is one-sided, as the daughter is just a brat and the mother is just
perfect. All the daughter moans throughout the film is that she wants
her father back. When the father does come back, he asks for a
divorce, but he fails to take her back with him. That took care of
that little conflict.</P>
<P>A romance was introduced by way of the Harry Connick
Jr. character. He's Justin Matisse, someone who always had a crush on
the very pretty all-American girl, but never had the nerve to pursue
the popular cheerleader. He conveniently pops up wherever she is; and,
comes across as a handsome cowboy and real nice guy, who would be
ideally suited for her. At least, that's what mamma Ramona thinks, as
she tries to push them together. At this point of the film, I was
hoping for some comedy or music to break out, like someone singing:
Matchmaker, Matchmaker, make me a match...</P>
<P>This film just couldn't move me with this familiar storyline; its
purpose was to try and get me so misty eyed for these two nice people
who can't find romance together.  But by the film's conclusion, there
is the predictable happy ending, with the virtues of a nuclear family
back in tack. The last shot is of the couple out on a family style
date, supposedly on their way to future marital bliss. I guess this is
ok, because you really can't root against them, and the way this film
was slowly moving along, with lots of wasted artistic shots of the
small-town that had no impact on the story; at least, it satisfied an
audience who would appreciate seeing such a clean-cut and prosaic
romance. It was truely a woman's picture.</P>
<P>The nicest thing about this film was that it made for pleasant
viewing.  There was nothing to really get upset about. Sandra Bullock
is very pretty and very nice. She has the best line in the film about
her husband: "The harder I tried to be what he wanted me to be, the
less I saw in his eyes. And then one day I looked and I was gone."
Her new suitor wants to be independent and live out the American dream
without conforming to society's wishes. That is also commendable.  He
is following his own dreams, building an interesting house out of
stained glass and antique Texas pine.The daughter, who was the most
annoying one in the film, is upset that her father is no longer living
at home, something lots of children at her young age experience, but
can't do anything about. No one tells her how to behave properly, so
she continues to be a pest. The problem with all this, is that these
topics are very similar to the real life situations of many Americans,
but this film adds no new insights to the problems or any kind of
humanity to it. It just ends on an uninspired happy note. It,
therefore, was unable to rise to the emotional level needed to sustain
a sense of drama. The result is: that there is nothing special about
this film to recommend it, nor is there anything particularly horrid
about it to urge you to avoid it.</P>
