<P>     Every once in a while, when an exceptional family film comes along, I
will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money 
where their mouths have been; with all the hubbub over the lack of films
suitable for children, it is remarkable how many non-Disney films
disappear in a couple of weeks.  Now I see that in so doing, I have
unfairly ghettoized these films.  So I am issuing my challenge not just to
parents, but to anyone who wants to support smart, funny, energetic
film-making:  see MATILDA.  See it in a theater, rather than shrugging and
waiting for it on video.  See the best film I have seen in 1996.  Not the
best children's film...the best film.  Period.</P>
<P>     Based on a story by Roald Dahl, it tells of young Matilda Wormwood
(Mara Wilson), an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is
to have a pair of deeply stupid parents:  Harry (Danny DeVito), a crooked
used car salesman; and Zinnia (Rhea Perlman), a simple-minded bingo
addict.  The Wormwoods barely notice Matilda exists, and when they do, it
is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books.  When they
finally do send her to school, it is to Crunchem Hall, a bleak place run
by cruel, child-hating Miss Agatha Trunchbull (Pam Ferris).  But things
begin to look up for Matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher,
Miss Honey (Embeth Davidtz), who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness.
Matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move
things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and Miss Honey to
overcome Miss Trunchbull's cruelty.</P>
<P>     It was this spring's JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH which inspired me to
note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more
than a hint of darkness to them, and you can bet that the Roald Dahl
responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of JAMES and WILLY WONKA AND THE
CHOCOLATE FACTORY has more of the same in store with MATILDA.  And just as
JAMES benefited from the dark sensibilities of Henry Selick and Tim
Burton, MATILDA soars on the cock-eyed direction of Danny DeVito.  DeVito
made black humor a key element in THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN and THE WAR
OF THE ROSES, and he contributes some memorable images.  In one scene, an
unfortunate girl is made an example of by Miss Trunchbull when she is
picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing
hammer; later, an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake
after he is caught stealing a dessert.  MATILDA is just twisted enough to
be a perfect fairy tale.</P>
<P>     It is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they
manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize
that they are learning them.  There is a hilarious moment when Matilda's
television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading (in a
wicked joke, he thinks _Moby Dick_ is pornographic) and forces her to
watch an inane game show (hosted by Jon Lovitz) in which contestants are
smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing
around.  MATILDA is a story which promotes the value of intellectual
curiosity over passive entertainment, and it does so while poking holes in
that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because "I'm big and
you're little, I'm right and you're wrong."  More specifically, it has as
its heroine an intelligent, self-confident girl who struggles successfully
against other people's notions of how she should behave.  It is no
coincidence that MATILDA was co-written by Robin Swicord, who contributed
the superb recent adaptation of LITTLE WOMEN.</P>
<P>     Finally, MATILDA has that quality I find rarest and most treasured in
family entertainment:  it is family entertainment in the truest sense of
the word.  DeVito knows enough to make MATILDA fast-paced and appealing to
children, taking a deliciously nasty performance by Pam Ferris as Miss
Trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical
comedy, including a great chase through her dark house.  The child actors
are winning but never obnoxiously adorable, with Mara Wilson making
Matilda a clever and extremely likeable character.  But there are also
many, many delights for adults, including my favorite scene in which
Matilda uses her powers to frighten Miss Trunchbull by having chalk write
on a chalkboard by itself while Matilda's classmates recite in sing-song
fashion; there is also a deadpan cameo by Paul Reubens as an FBI agent
staking out Matilda's father.  I can't imagine anyone of any age leaving
Matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted.</P>
<P>     MATILDA is a film which left me glowing with good feeling.  I will
see it again, and years from now I will watch it with my children.  And
now I will stop, because somewhere near you MATILDA is about to begin, and
there is a seat in that theater you should be in, if you have a child or
ever were a child.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 child advocates:  10.</PRE>
