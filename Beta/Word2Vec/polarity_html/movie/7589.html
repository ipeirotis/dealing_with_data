<P>     Few screen romances are as touching, as tragic, and as life=20
affirming as the one shared by Nick (Robert Carlyle) and Karen (Juliet=20
Aubrey) in director Michael Winterbottom's GO NOW.  While the film is=20
ultimately about the effects of multiple sclerosis upon both a body and=20
a relationship, GO NOW is not the exercise in depression the material=20
might make it seem to be.  Winterbottom, who took an equally=20
unsentimental approach to his adaptation of Thomas Hardy's JUDE THE
OBSCURE, avoids numerous melodramatic pitfalls on the way to making Nick=20
and Karen's experiences with the disease real, believable, and=20
manipulation-free.  By including a copious amount of lowbrow humor and=20
occasionally using black-and-white freeze-frames with amusing captions,=20
Winterbottom never allows GO NOW to become too much of a downer.</P>
<P>     The film starts at the beginning -- the beginning of Nick and=20
Karen's relationship, that is.  They meet one night at a pub while Nick,=20
a construction worker with a passion for soccer, is out having drinks=20
with his best friend, Tony (James Nesbitt), and Karen is in the company=20
of her roommate, Paula (Sophie Okonedo).  While Tony aggressively=20
pursues sex with Paula, Nick and Karen connect in a quieter, more=20
meaningful way.  After a few chance meetings on the street following=20
their initial encounter, they start dating.  The relationship quickly=20
becomes serious, and the two move in together.  Only then does Nick's=20
disease begin to assert itself.  In this way, Winterbottom allows us to=20
get to know the characters before introducing complications.</P>
<P>     It starts slowly, with minor symptoms:  double vision, numbness of=20
the hands, and a lack of bladder control.  Nick goes for tests and is=20
diagnosed to have MS.  GO NOW doesn't use a didactic, "movie of the=20
week" approach to the subject.  It doesn't explain what MS is, why=20
people get it, or how they can live with it.  Instead, the film=20
concentrates on showing the condition's debilitating effects on Nick,=20
and, equally important, on his perfectly-healthy partner.  It's rare for=20
any motion picture about a disease to take such a blunt, uncompromising=20
look at how it can erode the foundation of even the most loving=20
relationship.  Sunk in frustration and self-pity, Nick frequently lashes=20
out at Karen, torn between wanting her to leave him alone in his misery=20
and needing her to help him.  For her part, Karen loves Nick dearly, but=20
his moodiness threatens to drive her into the arms of another man, if=20
only for a brief respite from Nick's rancor.</P>
<P>     Another interesting aspect of GO NOW is how it addresses the=20
quandary that Nick's friends find themselves in after he has been=20
stricken.  They're caught between walking on eggshells and trying too=20
hard to make it seem like he's still just "one of the guys."  None of=20
them walks the line adeptly, and one of Tony's jests cuts Nick deeply. =20
Still, the difficulties Nick's friends have adjusting to his condition=20
are minor compared with the conflicted emotions that Karen experiences.</P>
<P>     The acting in GO NOW is superlative.  Robert Carlyle, who was good=20
in RIFF-RAFF and TRAINSPOTTING, is amazing here, using body language,=20
facial expressions, and vocal intonations to convey his character's=20
experience to the audience.  Juliet Aubrey (Dorothea Brooke in the 1994=20
BBC version of MIDDLEMARCH), whose portrayal of Karen is just as=20
forceful and multi-faceted, never allows herself to be eclipsed by=20
Carlyle.  Even in the most dramatically powerful scenes, she stands toe-
to-toe with him.  Members of the supporting cast, especially James=20
Nesbitt (JUDE, HEAR MY SONG), are no less solid.</P>
<P>     With its rich and varied emotional texture, GO NOW is a movie that=20
you feel deep in the heart, with a pair of characters, Nick and Karen,=20
who are so vivid that they stay with you long after the theater lights=20
have gone on.  Coupled with JUDE (which was made after this film), Go=20
Now illuminates the director's keen, unerring insight into the=20
complexity of emotions and situations that movies too often reduce to=20
familiar clich=E9s. Wrenching, passionate, and unforgettable, GO NOW=20
hardly makes a misstep from beginning to end.</P>
