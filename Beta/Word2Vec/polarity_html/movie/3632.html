<P>     THE INCREDIBLY TRUE ADVENTURES OF TWO GIRLS IN LOVE, director Maria 
Maggenti's debut feature, is a lesbian romantic comedy.  Coming hot on 
the heels of BAR GIRLS and last year's GO FISH, it provides a different, 
although equally lighthearted, perspective on a romance between two 
females.  In this case, the protagonists are high school girls, and the 
experience represents the first stirrings of true love for each of them. </P>
<P>     ADVENTURES gets off to an unpromising start, with some mediocre 
opening music that screams "I'm a comedy!" (as if the overlong title 
wasn't enough to get the point across).  For about the first half-hour, 
most of the jokes fall flat, and the few that work are unlikely to cause 
more than a smattering of laughter.  The characters follow fairly 
traditional patterns.  Randy (Laurel Hollomon) is a tough-as-nails 
tomboy living in "your typical, normal lesbo household."  Eve (Nicole 
Ari Parker) is a well-spoken, intelligent young woman who has just 
broken up with her boyfriend.  The two get together and become friends.</P>
<P>     Although the opening scenes aren't a memorable example of movie 
making, at least they're infused with a high level of energy and 
enthusiasm.  Regardless of script and budget limitations, it's clear 
that director Maria Maggenti invested a great deal of herself in this 
project.  She made ADVENTURES to show the world that lesbian love is 
just as funny and touching as its heterosexual counterpart. </P>
<P>     Fortunately, as things start heating up between Randy and Eve, the 
screenplay gets a needed influx of winning humor.  And, as the level of 
comedy escalates, the audience warms up to the characters.  While it's 
true that neither is fleshed out to three dimensions, both radiate auras 
of likability.  The laughter and general goodwill generated by the final 
hour makes the plodding first thirty minutes forgivable. </P>
<P>     ADVENTURES doesn't offer any new or unexpected revelations about 
lesbian lifestyles or gay/straight interaction.  Many of Maggenti's 
secondary characters are caricatures, but Randy and Eve thankfully 
settle on a slightly elevated plane.  This is in part due to fine 
performances by two little-known actresses, Laurel Hollomon and Nicole 
Ari Parker, who didn't get paid for the work they contributed. </P>
<P>     This film is probably a little too predictable to appeal to the 
wide, "crossover" audience Fine Line is aiming for, but it offers a 
better-than-average entertainment experience for those who suffered 
through the likes of CLAIRE OF THE MOON and the aforementioned BAR 
GIRLS.  THE INCREDIBLY TRUE ADVENTURES OF TWO GIRLS IN LOVE represents a 
moderately enjoyable, if somewhat silly, diversion, which, in essence, 
makes it a typical -- although untraditional -- entry into the romantic 
comedy genre. </P>
