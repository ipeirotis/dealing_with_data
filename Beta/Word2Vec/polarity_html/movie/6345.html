<PRE>                                  HENRY V
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ****</PRE>
<P>     Camera Three in San Jose is continuing their six weeks long
Shakespeare festival.  This week I saw Kenneth Branagh's brilliant
HENRY V (1989).  It number one on my best of the year list for 1989,
but since I wasn't a movie critic then, I never wrote a review of it.</P>
<P>     "A kingdom for a stage, princes to act," begins the careful
narration by Derek Jacobi ("I Claudius").  His is the canonical British
actor's accent - rich and melodious.  Truly, he could read the
encyclopedia, and people would pay to listen.  His small part is a
crucial one for he provides the tensive glue that binds the play
together.</P>
<P>     The secret of this movie is the star, the screenwriter, and the
director, namely Kenneth Branagh.  He is arguably the preeminent
Shakespearean interpreter in the world today, and the best of all of
his works is this production of HENRY V.</P>
<P>     I've thought about what it is that makes his Henry V come alive
so, and it may come down to the basics.  He is the master of
Shakespearean enunciation.  Every word is clear and forceful even when
he speaks in whispers.  Most Shakespearean actors run through their
lines in a blur as if either they have so much to say they have to talk
fast or, more likely, they don't fully comprehend them all.  Branagh
gives the impressions that he has been studying the Bard's original
folios since birth.  He presents each word to maximum effect.</P>
<P>     Any film that is smart enough to get Simon Rattle and the
Birmingham Symphony to do the music has already proven their
seriousness of purpose.  For those of you not familiar with them,
Rattle and his orchestra are arguably the best Mahlerian interpreters
in the music world today.  Since Henry V has the force of a Mahler
symphony, what more appropriate group to play the film's music (Patrick
Doyle).  Their sounds in the film are full of power and energy that
further illuminate and enhance the action.</P>
<P>     The cinematography by Kenneth MacMillan (A SUMMER STORY, OF MICE
AND MEN, and CIRCLE OF FRIENDS) is inviting.  The interior scenes are
not only lit strictly with candles, but the light even flickers on the
players as real candles would.  When HENRY V enters the room for the
first time, he is in shadow and framed in bright lights from behind.
As he walks forward, the camera is below him to increase his stature.
This all combines to give the king the aura of a god.  Since I am about
Branagh's height, I thought, now that's how I'd like to be framed.</P>
<P>     Actually, Branagh's physical appearance makes gives him a unique
force of presence.  His thin lips almost vanish as he speaks which
force the viewers attention even more on his words.  His brow radiates
energy and optimism as he delivers the best speech in the play, the St.
Crispin day speech, "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers."</P>
<P>     Branagh's Henry V is the epitome of self-assurance.  No matter how
bleak the odds, he has the force of will to convince his men they could
defeat a army of any size.  His facial expressions radiate confidence.
You see him, and you believe.</P>
<P>     Branagh, the director, is a master at opening up the Bard's plays.
The interior scenes are intimate, but it is in the exterior where his
directorial genius shines.  His outdoor scenes are full of power to
complement the words that are spoken.  There are also realistic.  His
battle of Agincourt becomes a mud bowl and the march to it even worse.
His soldier's lives are truly miserable.</P>
<P>     Emma Thompson has a fairly small part as Katherine, the daughter
of the French King (Paul Scofield).  She and her companion, Mistress
Quickly (Judi Dench), supply the comic relief in the story.  They
giggle their lines, which are almost exclusively in French.  My
favorite is Dench who steals her scenes with her perky and silly little
mannerisms.</P>
<P>     As a frequent visitor to the British Isles, I loved Constable's
(Richard Easton) line toward the end when he can not figure out how
anyone who lives in a country with such miserable weather could have
the strength to defeat them.  "Where have they this mettle?  Is not
their climate foggy, raw and dull?"</P>
<P>     As the battle of Agincourt ends, an exhausted Henry confesses to
the French envoy Mountjoy (Christopher Ravenscroft), "I know not if the
day be ours or no."  To which Montjoy simply replies, "The day is
yours."</P>
<P>     I could go on and on about this film.  The rest of the cast is
outstanding.  Even the small details like the sounds of the rush of the
arrows in the battle is impressive.  A film to be seen and savored,
again and again.</P>
<P>     HENRY V runs 2:17.  It is rated PG for some tastefully done, but
realistic war violence.  There is no sex, nudity, or bad language.  The
film would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested in the play.
I give the picture my strongest recommendation and rate it ****.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
