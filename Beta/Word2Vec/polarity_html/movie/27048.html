<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Truly one of the greatest films ever made, but one steeped in
controversy ever since cinema's boy genius Orson Welles, on his return
to Hollywood after being away for 10 years, was asked to play the part
of the film's corrupt police chief...but since the film didn't have a
director, the film's star, Charlton Heston, suggested to the people at
Universal that they get Orson to direct it (this is Heston's version).
And direct it he did, pouring into this fantastically shot
black-and-white classical noir film, a tale about murder, betrayal
between friends, the vile actions of a porcine sheriff, and many other
controversial themes for the 1950s including gang rape, racism, sexual
ambiguity, drugs, and wholesale police corruption. It was magnificently
photographed by emphasizing the contrasts between dark and light shades
as filmed by the great cinematographer Russell Metty, which abetted the
imaginative tale, whose main story is about the downfall of the sleazy,
obese lawman played with sheer brilliance by Orson.</P>
<P>It's a B-film more powerful and hard-boiled than the weak-minded
upper-studio heads at Universal could handle. So they did what dullards
seem to do when faced with a genius they don't comprehend, they tried to
ruin Orson's film by re-editing it, and one of their studio hack
directors, a man named Harry Keller, came in to redo parts of the film
after Orson left the country to try and get backing for the Don Quixote
project he was interested in doing next. Orson pleaded with the studio
to keep the film intact, he even sent them a 58-page memo telling them
exactly how he wanted the film presented and stood fast on any changes.
The studio kept the memo, but made three different versions and released
the film ignoring Orson's wishes. The video that came out in the '70s
was an interpretation of the three re-edited versions, which was far
removed from the way Orson wanted it seen. The film ended up as a box
office disappointment, giving ammo to those in Hollywood who said that
he could only make an art film and not a commercial one. Orson refused
to recognize the version that Universal sent to the movie theaters as
his film, in fact he called it an 'odious thing.'</P>
<P>Never fully receiving the recognition that the film should have gotten
for the masterpiece it was, it was even considered by some film critics
to be a disappointing Welles film, not comparable to his masterpiece of
"Citizen Kane." The film, nevertheless, got recognized abroad,
especially by the French New Wave directors and eventually the film was
starting to get a following among young intellectuals in this country
and started to get its just recognition for the poetically visionary and
original film it was. It was a film that did things films never did
before, both technically and as a hard-hitting Baroque thriller. It was
the first film to have natural dialogue in a moving car. It shot its now
famous opening scene in a long tracking shot without credits or titles,
that lasted 3-minutes without a cut and kept the background natural
sounds of the street, instead of the Henry Mancini soundtrack, as the
newlyweds strolled amidst the tawdry bars, strip clubs and sleaze of Los
Robles, the run-down town on the Mexican side of the border. It is
arguably the greatest opening shot in film history because of its visual
impact in setting up the feature's characters and the tenseness of the
story that was to follow. Orson used a hand-held camera and specialized
not only in wide-angle shots but by his constant intercutting, he was
able to keep the action flowing and the story suspenseful. The film had
been restored somewhat by 1978 for its video distribution and it picked
up some running time from how it was first shown at 96 minutes and now
it was back to its original time of 108 minutes. In the 1990s the film
was finally pieced together from the memo Orson sent the studio and the
hack director's scenes were cut, and it picked up an additional three
minutes. The effort to restore the film to the way Orson originally shot
it, allowed the story to become clearer and for the film to have the
shape the artist wanted it to have. This is about the closest we could
get to the way Orson filmed it, since he passed away in 1985 and we have
no other idea about what else he may have wanted to do with the film. He
never made a Hollywood film since, as the studio blackballed him.</P>
<P>The film opens in a Mexican border town in California; the actual
location of the film was in Venice, California, once a prosperous resort
town, but now is run-down, surrounded by oil wells and has a seedy look
to it, making it look just right for an unsavory border town. Mike
Vargas (Heston) is a Mexican police investigator coming back to his
country to be a witness at the trial of the narcotic dealers he
arrested, who are members of the Grandi family. Vargas is someone who is
well-educated, speaks a perfect English and has connections to the
powers in the Mexican government. His new bride is an American named
Susan (Leigh). She is a pretty blonde, who is accompanying her husband
to the trial in Mexico City and calling this trip their honeymoon. But
the story immediately has a strange twist to it, as someone plants a
ticking time bomb in the car of the wealthy businessman Mr. Linnekar,
who has just crossed over the border from Mexico when the bomb kills him
and the stripper who is in the car with him.</P>
<P>The crime takes place on the American side, so the notorious police
chief Harry Quinlan (Welles) is called in to investigate. Vargas is
worried that the bomb was planted on the Mexican side of the border and
is afraid that his country might be involved in some sort of
international incident, so he sticks around to watch over the
investigation. He foolishly leaves Susan alone on the Mexican side to
wait for him at their hotel, but she gets intercepted by a punk kid
named Pancho, who brings her to a big eared, toupee wearing character
called "Uncle Joe" Grandi (Akim Tamiroff), who schemes up a plan to
intimidate her and stop Vargas from testifying at the trial of his
mobster brother. To Susan's regrets, the Mexicans act as despicable as
she surmised they would, as she can't wait to get back to America.</P>
<P>The film gets more complex as the police immediately arrest a Mexican
shoe clerk named Sanchez, who has been dating Linnekar's daughter and
living off her money, against the wishes of her father. There is no
proof against him, but Quinlan catches criminals by using his intuition
and when he needs evidence, he is in the habit of planting it. He has a
vendetta against criminals ever since his wife was strangled and the
murderer was never found. Vargas knows that dynamite was planted in
Sanchez's apartment by Quinlan, and thereby cannot let the arrest of
Sanchez slide, as he goes on the hunt to gather evidence against Quinlan
to prove that he is someone who has a history of framing suspects.</P>
<P>Spoiler: For those who don't want to follow the rest of the story,
please stop reading at this point and resume reading the last paragraph,
which makes some further points about the film.</P>
<P>The film tells three stories at this point, as it intercuts between
Vargas working with the honest Assistant DA Schwartz (Mills) to get the
info on all of Quinlan's arrests, and it tells the other story of
Vargas's wife, who Vargas neglects because he gets too busy with
Quinlan. Susan is being intimidated by Grandi's relatives in the motel
she is alone at, who are threatening to gang rape her. Her only help can
be from someone who is not capable of helping, a nutty night clerk,
played by Dennis Weaver with manic craziness, who has more tics than a
dog with fleas. Vargas is unaware that the motel is owned by Uncle Joe,
at this point he is only interested in looking out for the interest of
Mexico and his career, forgetting for a moment about his wife until
guilty feelings creep up on him and thoughts of her alone with only
low-class Mexicans around her sends chills up his spine. But the main
story is about Quinlan, whose 30 year career as a crime fighter is about
to come falling down, as he is now forced to conspire with Uncle Joe to
frame Vargas's wife as a junkie and make out that Vargas is a narcotic
dealer, in order for him to ruin Vargas and stop him from exposing him.</P>
<P>All these three stories come together in a fantastically lively way.
Suzy is trapped in her room by Grandi's young punks, lesbians and
drug-induced thugs, and she is forcefully drugged and probably a victim
of a gang rape. She is then brought to a different hotel on the Mexican
side of the border, surrounded with drug paraphernalia to make it look
like she's a drug addict. Quinlan uses this opportunity to strangle
Uncle Joe in her room and make it look like Susan did it. But Quinlan's
best friend and most devoted follower, Sergeant Menzies (Calleia),
discovers Quinlan's cane in the room and realizes he can't look the
other way any more, since he also knows Vargas is hot on Quinlan's trail
and he wrestles with his conscience and decides to work with Vargas by
having a concealed microphone taped to his body while Vargas records
Quinlan's confession on a tape recorder from a short distance away. This
is the first time in 18 years that the once alcoholic Quinlan has gone
on a drinking binge and when he is confronted by Menzies, he is reeling
from drunkeness.</P>
<P>Before Quinlan meets with Menzies, there is an intriguing scene where
Quinlan goes to his old flame's apartment, where a player-piano cuts
into their conversational space. He hasn't seen her for a long time and
she barely recognizes him as he has become very fat (it's the padding)
and walks in a lumbering way. She's a gypsy fortune-teller tart called
Tanya (Dietrich), who reads the tarot cards to tell him that his future
is all used up. Upon meeting Menzies, he senses it's too late, that he
talked into the machine giving away his guilt and he thereby shoots
Menzies, still hoping to frame Vargas for that murder. But as his
confession is played back to Schwartz, who has just arrived on the scene
to tell Vargas that his wife is OK, Menzies manages to kill Quinlan
before he dies. The subtle beauty of this scene, is in the restored
version, where it looks as if the machine killed him. Then Tanya returns
to view Quinlan's body lying in the shallow ditch amid the strewn
garbage and Dietrich ends the film with the best film quote ever to end
a film on, when asked about him, she replies, "What does it matter what
you say about people... !"</P>
<P>Fans of the cinema should be pleased with this restored work and after
seeing it will have a chance to judge for themselves which version is
the masterpiece. There should be no doubt about what that choice should
be. For cinefiles, thanks must go out to those who put in such a
worthwhile effort to get this restoration accomplished. Jonathan
Rosenbaum, one of the finest film critics today, published a large
portion of Welles's memo in Film Quarterly a few years ago and thereby
got the ball rolling to restore the film. His article attracted the
attention of producer Rick Schmidlin, who interested both Universal and
the Oscar-winning editor Walter Murch ("The Conversation") to restore
the film according to Welles's memo, which they did and is the version I
reviewed.</P>
