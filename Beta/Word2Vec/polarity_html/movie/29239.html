<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Edward Dmytryk was a victim of the Hollywood blacklist, here he returns after a
few years in exile to make a Stanley Kramer produced message drama shot in a
realistic style. The film makes good use of the San Francisco streets to tell
its serial-killer psycho story. The main problem with the film is that the
psycho, Eddie Miller (Franz), is a dull delivery  truck driver for a cleaner and
his killing of young brunette women because they remind him of the mother he
hates, didn't seem to be more than a Psychology 1 text book explanation. The
film blames society for not giving him help for his mental problems, as all his
attempts to get help are rebuffed. </P>
<P>He will end up killing five as a sniper, using his Army M-1 carbine to kill from
the rooftops. 
The film opens with Eddie calling the shrink he had while serving 18 months in a
prison psycho ward for bashing a woman over the head, as he feels that
uncontrollable inner rage coming over him again. But the vacationing shrink
can't be reached until he returns in two weeks. </P>
<P>Out of despair, Eddie self-inflicts second degree burns on his right hand by
holding it over a stove. The doctor treating the wound in the emergency room of
the hospital suspects he might need psychological help, but then gets too busy
with accident victims to follow through with getting him help. </P>
<P>Delivering a dress to Jean Darr (Windsor), an attractive brunette piano
performer in a bar, he becomes upset with her when she turns her attention away
from him and to her boyfriend who appears at her door. She hustles him out the
back entrance, which seems to upset him so much that he waits for her to leave
work at night and then precedes to make her his first victim. </P>
<P>This brings a hardened police Lieutenant Kafka (Menjou) to investigate the
murder. Soon another victim, May Nelson (Dwyer), pops up. She's a barfly who
rejected him when she met him in a bar, as she caught him in a lie about the
kind of work he does. </P>
<P>The newspapers get hold of the serial killer aspect to the story and play it up
in their papers, challenging the police to catch the killer. The manhunt for the
killer becomes a political football, as the present administration is blamed for
being inept. Under public pressure to get the killer Lt. Kafka rounds up all
known sex offenders for questioning, but is told by the police psychiatrist, Dr.
Kent (Kiley), that he is wasting his time. He then lectures the newspaper men
and the police, telling them the killer is killing his mother over and over
again. The shrink tells them that they should be looking for someone who got
into trouble before for attacking a woman and possibly received treatment for
his mental problems. </P>
<P>The film's success lies in the professional performance given by Adolph Menjou
(ironically he was a willing witness for HUAC, as he hated Commies and did his
best to keep them blacklisted). Here, he's a weary veteran San Francisco
detective, who eventually sees that he's after someone who is mentally sick;
and, that he kills because he can't help himself and not for criminal reasons.
He gets with the program Dr. Kent is supporting, that is to get psychological
help for the crazed criminal before it's too late. When they corner the heavily
armed psycho in his drab hotel room, there is a single tear coming down his
cheek as if to signify relief that he is caught and will be stopped from
killing. </P>
<P>The film's message was not that well received, but the suspense of tracking down
the nondescript psycho had a good touch to it. The film was a blend of film noir
and social drama, pointing out the urban problems of alienation and the public's
indifference to those who are mentally unbalanced. </P>
