<P>     There's an old saying that states something about leaving the best 
for last.  George Lucas certainly didn't follow that adage when crafting 
the original STAR WARS trilogy.  RETURN OF THE JEDI, the final 
installment of the series, is easily the least innovative and most hokey 
of the three films.  In fact, most of the enjoyment derived from this 
motion picture comes from the simple act of getting together with old 
friends and enemies one more time.  If Luke, Han, Leia, and Vader were 
replaced by nameless, faceless characters, RETURN OF THE JEDI wouldn't 
be a whole lot more interesting than INDEPENDENCE DAY.</P>
<P>     Cuteness is the watchword here.  The dark, eerie atmosphere that 
oozed from every frame of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is gone.  Instead, for 
RETURN OF THE JEDI, we have good triumphing decisively over evil, a too-
pat resolution to a love triangle, and walking teddy bears.  Even Darth 
Vader doesn't seem very daunting this time around.  With the arrival of 
the Emperor (a gaunt-looking Ian McDiarmid), Vader has turned into a 
second fiddle.  It's decidedly unsatisfactory to watch him engage Luke 
in a civilized conversation.  </P>
<P>     RETURN OF THE JEDI picks up an unspecified time after the 
conclusion of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie 
Fisher), Lando (Billy Dee Williams), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and the 
droids (Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker) are on a rescue mission to 
Luke's home planet of Tatooine.  Their aim:  to save Han (Harrison Ford) 
from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt.  Once this goal is attained, it's 
back to outer space, where the Rebel alliance is about to face the 
Empire's newest threat:  a second, more powerful Death Star, that, if 
activated, could spell doom for anyone who stands against the Emperor.  
So, while the fleet prepares for the final battle, Luke and company 
travel to the forest moon of Endor to knock out the shield that defends 
the Death Star against all attacks.  There, they are befriended by the 
Ewoks, the teddy bear-like indigenous race, and Luke, fearing that his 
presence is endangering the group, turns himself over to Vader.</P>
<P>     RETURN OF THE JEDI has some interesting elements.  The 
Luke/Vader/Emperor scenes are suitably tense and well-acted, and, if the 
resolution isn't a complete surprise, at least it's a little more 
original that it could have been.  From a technical point-of-view, the 
space battles are amazing, easily dwarfing anything depicted in the 
previous films.  Not only are there many, many more ships, but their 
speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved.  On one 
level, RETURN OF THE JEDI is almost worth watching for the special 
effects.  In the SPECIAL EDITION, a new, equally repugnant dance number 
has been added to the Jabba the Hutt scene.  Additionally, there are 
some impressive touches tacked onto the ending.  Once again, while the 
improvements don't significantly alter the viewing experience, they're 
fun to spot.</P>
<P>     While there isn't much of a down side to STAR WARS or THE EMPIRE 
STRIKES BACK, RETURN OF THE JEDI has some serious drawbacks.  First and 
foremost are the Ewoks, an unbearably cuddly race that seem handpicked 
to generate toy sales.  Children enjoy these creatures; everyone I know 
over age 12 finds them insufferably annoying.  Then there's the 
unbelievably cheap cop-out that Lucas uses to erase the Luke/Han/Leia 
triangle.  Whether Lucas had this in mind from the beginning is 
irrelevant -- it's a bad idea.  Not only does it defuse romantic 
tension, but it leaves viewers shaking their heads in incredulity.  
There are other problems too -- the death toll on the rebel side seems 
shockingly small for a "final battle" and a bit of foreshadowing 
regarding the Millennium Falcon's fate is thrown out the window.  Of 
course, I could also make the rather obvious observation that large 
elements of RETURN OF THE JEDI are lifted from the original STAR WARS, 
indicating that the creative wellspring of writers George Lucas and 
Lawrence Kasdan had perhaps run dry.</P>
<P>     The acting in RETURN OF THE JEDI is stronger than in the previous 
films.  By now, Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher have all 
matured in their on-screen personas.  The chemistry amongst the trio is 
terrific, with the only awkward moments coming during the Luke/Leia 
conversations when they discuss their origins.  As in EMPIRE, Billy Dee 
Williams gives us another human hero to root for.  Newcomer Ian 
McDiarmid plays the Emperor as a suitably creepy, cunning, and evil 
creature, although he's not as imposing as Vader was in STAR WARS.  </P>
<P>     Although it was great fun re-watching STAR WARS and THE EMPIRE 
STRIKES BACK again on the big screen, RETURN OF THE JEDI doesn't 
generate the same sense of enjoyment.  And, while Lucas worked 
diligently to re-invigorate each entry into the trilogy, JEDI needs more 
than the patches of improved sound, cleaned-up visuals, and a few new 
scenes.  Still, despite the flaws, this is still STAR WARS, and, as 
such, represents a couple of lightly-entertaining hours spent with 
characters we have gotten to know and love over the years.  RETURN OF 
THE JEDI is easily the weakest of the series, but its position as the 
conclusion makes it a must-see for anyone who has enjoyed its 
predecessors.</P>
