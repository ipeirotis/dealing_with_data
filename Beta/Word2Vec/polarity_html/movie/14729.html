<PRE>Review: Your Friends & Neighbors (1998)
Review By: Ryan Davis</PRE>
<P>        Your Friends And Neighbors is a rather bizarre film about 6 people, who
hop in and out of bed with each other. Written and directed by Neil LaBute,
who's first film, "In The Company Of Men" was simply marvelous, disappoints a
bit here with this one.</P>
<P>        The story involves two couples(Ben Stiller & Catherine Keener and Aaron
Eckhart & Amy Brenneman), an artist assistant(Nastassja Kinski), and an
egotistical women abuser(Jason Patric). The character's names are not apparent
and are not mentioned in the entire movie.</P>
<P>        Each of the characters has their own sexual style and they don't seem
to "merge" together well. So the group experiments behind their respective
partners back. There are some hysterical  scenes, one involves Jason Patric,
Aaron Eckhart, and Ben Stiller's characters. They are all in a sauna, talking
about their best "lay", when Jason Patric's character makes a surprising
confession. The whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and
acted.</P>
<P>        The enjoyed this movie, although it seemed a tad lengthy(even though
it only runs 99 min.). The film's cast is exceptional with Oscar caliber
performances by Catherine Keener, Aaron Eckhart, and Jason Patric.  I would
not recommend this film, to people who are offended by conversations that are
very sexually explicit. It did seem to offend people, more than half of the
people in the theater left during the film. Although Your Friends And
Neighbors doesn't have the power of LaBute's earlier film it still manages to
be somewhat entertaining and funny, while maintaining a melancholy philosophy
on human relationships.</P>
