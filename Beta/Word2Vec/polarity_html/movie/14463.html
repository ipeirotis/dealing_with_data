<P>   A cartoon in the New Yorker magazine some years ago
features a young American tourist staring up at a disbelieving
guide and insisting, "But I don't want to see the REAL Paris; I
want to see the TOURIST'S Paris."  Who can blame her?  If
writer-director Gaspar Noe's image of working-class areas of
Paris and a part of the French countryside in 1980 are any
intimation, this is not the country glorified by Jacques Demy
where the most of the women resemble Catherine Deneuve. 
This is down-and-dirty terrain, and Noe portrays its
uncompromisingly bleak topography populated by denizens
who'd be more at home in the digs of Gorky's stories than in
Maxim's.  Taking a clue from Jean-Luc Godard with a nod
toward Bert Brecht, Noe films his drama of devastation with
screen-covering signposts advising viewers of what is to come
or ironically pontificating with fortune-cookie slogans like "Man
is Moral."  In one of his signposts that leave us wondering
whether to chuckle or bolt, he jackets the screen with the
admonition, "You have ten seconds to leave the screening of
this movie."  In case anyone out there has the temerity to
close his eyes rather than look at the nihilistic violence,
degradation, and utter degeneration portrayed in this hell-
raising venture, Noe rouses him with a bang--literally--a noise
not unlike the sound of the automatic weapon which the
principal character caresses like a phallic symbol.</P>
<P>   "I Stand Alone," which could be more literally entitled "One
Against All" from the French title "Seul Contre Tous," is
narrated by a bankrupt, unemployed butcher who has nothing
to his name after thirty-five years of grinding up the
horsemeat loved by some components of French society. 
Himself abandoned as an infant, he has an autistic daughter
whom he has given up to an institution, a fat, pregnant
mistress whom he hates, and a despised mother-in-law who
lives with them in a tenement somewhere in the sticks of Lille. 
The man is virtually franc-less and so self-destructive that he
even loses a chance to work as a deli man in a supermarket
because he is literally unable to smile.</P>
<P>   While there is some dialogue as the 50-year-old butcher
talks with his mistress, two prospective employers, some
people in a bar and eventually his attractive but mentally
challenged daughter, most of the action takes place in the
man's head as he turns from a reasonably decent person to
an increasingly obsessed and violent beast.  Noe does not
bother with much inquiry into how this lumpen creature
became almost preternaturally frenzied, nor do we need to
know much more than the reality of his unhappy upbringing. 
We'll simply have to accept the man as a representation of
what any of us could be capable of, though few in the
audience could picture themselves ever punching their wives'
or girl friends' fetusus to death in a fit of rage.  </P>
<P>   His father is said to have been a Communist and the
butcher possesses a view of France that runs the gamut from
Marxism to Fascism without a detour on the way.  He is not
political in the intellectual sense of the word but has visceral
inclinations against people in his country whom he feels do
not belong there and against the powerful rich whom he
judges to be all "queer."  He parrots slogans that he may
have picked up on TV such as the concept that the Law
exists simply to protect the rich and should have no bearing
on the proper moral conduct of the masses.</P>
<P>   Ideas aside, "Seul Contre Tous" is acted with passion by
Philipe Nahon, whose unsmiling countenance and fiery
surveillance of his limited world reflect a torment leading
rapidly into schizophrenia.  The film--which includes hard-core
pornography, and an intensely violent close-up of a woman
spurting blood from the neck as she lies bleeding to death of
a gunshot wound--virtually clobbers the viewers with a vista of
a France so infected with racism, unemployment and physical
deterioration that it looks like Gallic post-Armageddon
cosmos.  Unlike the Italo-Turkish film "Hamam"--an optimistic
picture which maintains that you can indeed start out anew by
changing your environment--"I Stand Alone" stands as one of
the bleakest, most nihilistic portraits of debasement, decline,
and deterioration in memory.  While some may say, "What's
the point?" Gaspar Noe deserves acclaim for furnishing us
with an original piece of cinema worthy of attention for its
sheer audacity.</P>
