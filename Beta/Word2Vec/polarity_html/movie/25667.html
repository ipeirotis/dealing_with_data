<P>You know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes
out laughing...and it's not a comedy! And what a strange career path for
director Chuck Russell. He starts his career off with a decent take on the
"Nightmare on Elm Street" series with his debut as director on installment
number three. He follows that up with THE BLOB the very next year, but waits
another six years to do his next piece, a little film called THE MASK
starring Jim Carrey, and then one more star vehicle in ERASER two years
after that. So then he thought, "Let me wait another five years, get a weak
script jammed with cliches and hope that Jimmy Smits and Kim Basinger could
pull it out of its ashes"?!? Strange dude and one crappy flick.</P>
<P>PLOT:
A six-year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent
down from God. A Satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side,
while the girl's aunt wants to...well, save her from those damn devil
worshippers! Enter one occult expert agent, plenty of bobo cops and lots of
nuns praying, and you've just about got the gist of things here.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
With plot holes the size of my ass, this movie barely squeezes any sense out
of its cliché-ridden plot, with wasted talent, cheezy effects, bad dialogue
and unintentional laughs to boot. What's good about this movie? Well, Rufus
Sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children's
shelter/Satanist supreme, with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in
his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around. The little girl
is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn't really do all
that much. And believe it or not, I was actually enjoying some of the film's
first half hour, which starts off with some promise, but not before bonehead
moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist, Basinger, just drown the
film's entire basis of believability. For some reason, it takes her more
time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted, and even longer to
figure out that every move that she makes...is a dumb one! Add that to the
entire police force of incompetents, save for Jimmy Smits (whose talent
agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from NYPD BLUE
would be a good career move? At least change the clothes, Jimmy!), zero
scares, zero thrills and even less actual drama, and you've got yourself a
pretty bad movie. And why would respected actors like Christina Ricci and
Ian Holm take bit parts in this movie? Did they owe the director a favor or
something? Together, they barely have five minutes of screen time, but I
suppose that Ricci's hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of
you horn-dogs.</P>
<P>The worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending,
which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of
"sneaking up" on a man's house, who they know to be guilty of a crime!
Uuuhmm...how's about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass,
officers?! Anyway, I don't usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the
stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe
without validating it with solid idiotic proof (and there was plenty to go
around). And did Basinger lose some of her acting "talent" during her hiatus
from the profession after her 1997 Oscar win? Difficult to say if it was her
lines that were really bad, or if she just delivered them poorly. Either
way, little originality, very obvious computer effects, little thrills,
little drama and very little entertainment value, certainly bestow the honor
of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film. But if you really
don't mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various Satanic and "kid"-based
thrillers, and enjoy watching films that don't bring anything new to the
table...well, drink some beers, smoke some beans and rent this video,
because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year.</P>
