<P>     From beneath broad-brimmed hats, the dark eyes of Helena Bonham
Carter burn with primal ferocity in THE WINGS OF THE DOVE; behind veils of
lace, her mind ponders decidedly un-ladylike thoughts.  Carter's body of
film work, including noteworthy roles in A ROOM WITH A VIEW, HOWARDS END,
WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD and TWELFTH NIGHT, might lead you to suspect
she was born wearing a corset.  It also makes WINGS a particularly
intriguing addition to her resume.  Like most of her previous films, this
one is a costume drama based on a classic novel (by Henry James).  This
time, however, Carter creates a character who prowls through every scene
as though she may tear off that corset at any moment with a howl of rage
against the social order.</P>
<P>     Eventually she does remove the offending garment (more on which
momentarily), but the preceding moments build with a powerful sense of
anticipation.  Carter plays Kate Croy, a young turn-of-the-century
Englishwoman of minimal means taken in by her wealthy Aunt Maude
(Charlotte Rampling).  Maude has plans for her neice's future, plans which
do not include a poor husband like Kate's beloved, journalist Merton
Densher (Linus Roache).  Faced with choosing between her patron and her
heart, Kate discovers another alternative when she befriends American
heiress Millie Theale (Alison Elliott).  The terminally ill Millie has
eyes for Merton, which Kate sees as a perfect opportunity:  if Merton can
woo his way into Millie's will, Kate and Merton could eventually marry
after all.</P>
<P>     At the heart of this convoluted romantic triangle is author Henry
James' fascination with the differences between English and American
society.  For Kate, wealth means obligatory membership in a stratified
social system which has become a farce by 1910, with landed gentlemen like
Lord Mark (Alex Jennings) reduced to fortune-hunting to stave off
insolvency; for activist writer Merton, wealth is an arbitrary dividing
line separating him from his object of desire.  When Millie enters their
lives, both are confronted with challenges to their assumptions.  Though
wealthy, Millie is kind and never condescending, nor is she restricted by
social mandates.  While Kate envies Millie's freedom, Merton begins to
realize that Kate's actions are the result of her choices, not an
inevitable by-product of money.</P>
<P>     Those tense interpersonal dynamics are rendered with impressive
economy in Hossein Amini's screenplay.  THE WINGS OF THE DOVE comes in at
under an hour and 45 minutes, a remarkable achievement for a literary
adaptation made even more remarkable by the richness of the
characterizations.  The requisite sumptuous production values are all in
place (notably John Beard's spectacular production design), yet THE WINGS
OF THE DOVE never once sacrifices focus on the characters for fetishistic
period detail.  Merton's background is less focused than the rest, but
Linus Roache creates a convincing portrait of torn loyalties; as Millie,
Alison Elliott plays the doomed Millie with a tenderness of spirit which
never lapses into cinematic sainthood.</P>
<P>     Both Roache and Elliott are strong, but Helena Bonham Carter is a
powerhouse.  Her performance pulses with resentment and rationalized
deviousness, captured by Iain Softley in direction which holds on her face
whenever possible.  The potentially unsympathetic character of Kate
becomes a tragic figure who feels forced into plotting for her most basic
happiness.  In the film's climactic scene, Kate attempts to win back
Merton's affections by stripping naked in front of him, an achingly
desperate seduction by a desperate woman.  Carter shows plenty of nerve
(and plenty of skin) in that scene, but she also shows a range few of her
previous characters have required.  Freeing herself from the broad-brimmed
hats, veils of lace and, yes, even her corset, Helena Bonham Carter
exposes a tortured soul struggling to break free of roles dictated by
costume.  How very fitting.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 soaring doves:  9.</PRE>
