<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A slickly done, very depressive melodrama about those addicted to drugs
and their dreams of happiness. The dream that sucks the four main
characters (Burstyn, Leto, Connelly, and Wayans) ever downward, is the
American Dream. That is shown to be as deadly an addictive and as
dangerous a one as any junkie's high.</P>
<P>Darren Aronofsky's (Pi) adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel of the
forlorn, is given an image transfusion on the screen that belies the
fact that the addicts can't kick their habit and what we are forced to
see are their elusive visions and the wretched futility that unfolds for
them. It's a film that has excellent performances, especially, the
brilliant one by Ellen Burstyn, as the pill popping old lady who
morbidly changes her appearance for the worst after taking diet pills.
She plays Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) -- a Brighton Beach widow living
alone but obsessed with her only son. Her life is so empty that she
spends her time either watching TV game shows, staring at her
refrigerator, or sunning herself outside her apartment building with her
elderly women neighbors. She's overwhelmed that she's been selected as a
possible contestant on a game show, and decides that she's too fat and
must slim down to get into her favorite red dress she wore to her son's
graduation. She wants to impress the TV audience with her successful son
and how good she looks, and that motivates her to see a doctor who
prescribes amphetamines of different colors four times daily and within
a month she loses 25 pounds. Meanwhile, her son Harry (Jared Leto) has
become a heroin addict and also has an empty life filled with misplaced
dreams, which are on about the same surface level as her dreams; his are
about striking it rich as a drug dealer. His series of misfortunes will
culminate in his arm turning into a deep purple infection. In the climax
scene, both mother and son are hospitalized as a result of their dreams
turning into nightmares.</P>
<P>Aronofsky stylishly uses his camera to make us feel the internal grief
of those who are looking for an easy way out of their empty lives. It's
not an easy film to find comfort in, or feel anything but revulsion at
the sight of the constant degradation of human beings taking place. It's
also not an easy film to enjoy or to find any insights it has about drug
addictions that are fresh. What continually sparkles for this film, is
the way the mother-son relationship smacks of reality and how protective
they are of each other despite being unable to communicate with each
other. The best scenes in the film were when either Harry or Sara were
reaching out to the other to send out messages of hope. The heaviest
scenes were also the most creative ones, showing in montages the
constant barrage of  their wants and how twisted they were inside.
Mother's refrigerator talks to her and gets her into a dizzying speedy
motion as she moves about her empty apartment, while her son is shown
coming down from his heroin highs and settling into a despondent mood.</P>
<P>Harry has fallen in love with his girlfriend, Marion Silver (Jennifer
Connelly), whom he knew from his childhood days in Brooklyn. Their love
and hopes for marital bliss is built around the possibility that he
could score a big drug deal with his equally ambitious black partner and
best friend, Ty (Marlon Wayans), and become financially secure. The
young men can't see themselves growing old and still being small time
hustlers and junkies, as they pin all their hopes on a big drug killing.</P>
<P>In the process, Harry degrades himself and Marion. When he needs money
to score his drug product, he has no qualms asking Marion to sleep with
her former therapist Arnold (Gullette-he starred in the director's
"Pi"), someone she reviles as a sleaze bag.</P>
<P>By the film's end, not much substance came through all the stylishly and
graphically depressing experiences the four main characters underwent;
what I mostly felt was tired from their actions and not wanting to see
any more of their hellish experiences. It's a movie where the first half
of it was clearly more subtle and better done than the more morbid and
predictable second half. I can applaud the director for his visual style
of filmmaking and the actors for giving voice to their characters on the
screen in a realistic way, but the story of four losers who can't get
out of Brooklyn still seems very ordinary despite all the high gloss
attached to it.</P>
