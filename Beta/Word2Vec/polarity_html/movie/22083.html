<P>     CRADLE WILL ROCK is a tapestry of American social activism in the
1930s ... and a fairly tattered one, at that. Beginning in the fall of
1936, Tim Robbins' fact-based drama introduces us to the Federal Theatre
Project, a W.P.A. sub-division dedicated to employing America's artists
for the low-cost entertainment of America's Depression-era masses. Among
the works funded by the project is "The Cradle Will Rock," a pro-union
musical written by Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria) and staged by the
ever-feuding tandem of producer John Houseman (Cary Elwes) and director
Orson Welles (Angus Macfayden). According to Congressman Martin Dies
(Harris Yulin), it's also too typical of the left-leaning tendencies of
the arts community. When Congress abruptly declares a moratorium on all
Federal Theatre Project activities, the F.T.P.'s director Hallie Flanagan
(Cherry Jones) attempts to set things straight politically. Meanwhile,
Welles and company decide on a more direct course of action.</P>
<P>     The F.T.P. controversy and the staging of "The Cradle Will Rock" is
the central story of CRADLE WILL ROCK, but it's far from the only one.
Sub-plots follow "Cradle" cast members like Aldo Silvano (John Turturro),
who turns his back on his pro-Fascist Italy family, and Olive Stanton
(Emily  Watson), a homeless aspiring singer. There are glimpses into the
glittering lives of the industrialists whose efforts supported Italy and
Germany prior to the war, including Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack) and
steel magnate Grey Mathers (Philip Baker Hall). There is a tale of
Rockefeller's battle with artist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) over the
mural Rivera has been commissioned to create in the new Rockefeller
Center. And there are stories of anti-Communist whistle-blowers like
W.P.A. clerk Hazel Huffman (Joan Cusack) and ventriloquist Tommy Crickshaw
(Bill Murray).</P>
<P>     If that seems like a lot to digest, it is. Robbins' sprawling
narrative attempts to approach the era's growing class unrest from every
possible angle, and in so doing can't quite do justice to any of them. 
Olive and Aldo are walking representations of the virtuous poor more than
they are actual characters; their counterparts in Mathers and William
Randolph Hearst (John Carpenter) are cackling industrialists who sit
around counting their money (quite literally, in one scene). Characters
with the potential to develop into something intriguing and complex --
like Margherita Sarfatti (Susan Sarandon), a Jewish propagandist for
Mussolini -- barely get enough screen time for you to remember who they
are. In a cinematic season where epic running times are epidemic, CRADLE
WILL ROCK clocks in at a meager-by-comparison 132 minutes, not nearly
enough time to render all its stories fully.</P>
<P>     It's a shame, too, because CRADLE WILL ROCK often shows flashes of
the compelling film that might have been. Robbins has real visual flair as
a director, including a great scene-setting opening Steadicam shot and
Blitzstein's sleep-deprived creation of "Cradle" (accompanied by
hallucinatory inspirations for its staging and commentary from his muse
Bertolt Brecht. Vanessa Redgrave has a juicy role as Mathers' "socially
conscious" wife, who gets a rebellious thrill out of watching a "Negro 
production of 'Macbeth,'" or helping Welles' pirate performance of 
"Cradle." And there's the theater group, with Macfayden chewing scenery as
the egotistical Welles and Elwes his effective foil as Houseman. Robbins
says in the press notes that he originally set out to do a film just about
the staging of "Cradle," before other storylines presented themselves. You
can't help but wish he had stayed more focused.</P>
<P>     In this era of fuming over the National Endowment for the Arts and
its support of "questionable" works, CRADLE WILL ROCK's themes are
certainly still timely. Robbins' sympathies are clearly with the social
activists, but, as he did in DEAD MAN WALKING, he shows a willingness to
explore the other side with some semblance of an open mind (if earnest,
misguided namer of names Hazel falls into that category). The problem with
CRADLE WILL ROCK isn't politics, though, but a reach exceeding Robbins'
grasp. He has so little time to spend exploring any of his stories that he
never delves into questions of what an artist sacrifices when he accepts
patronage, or examines the irony of "The Cradle Will Rock" being sabotaged
as much by the entertainers' unions as by the government. As an overview
history lesson, CRADLE WILL ROCK has much to recommend it. As a film, it's
too cursory a glance at too complex an issue.</P>
