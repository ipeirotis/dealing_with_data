BEFORE NIGHT FALLS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>BEFORE NIGHT FALLS, based on the memoirs of the same name, tells the 
story of Reinaldo Arenas (Javier Bardem), a gay, Cuban poet.  Perhaps 
"story" is too strong a word.  As directed by painter Julian Schnabel, 
whose only other movie was the also overrated BASQUIAT, BEFORE NIGHT 
FALLS is more a collection of half-formed images than any kind of a 
proper story.  Spanning Reinaldo's entire life, it never creates a 
single fully formed character.  </P>
<P>When the ending credits finally roll, all we know for sure about 
Reinaldo is that he was gay, persecuted and mother-fixated.  There are 
only hints of his literary skills.  The film suffers almost exactly the 
same problem as FINDING FORRESTER, the other recent movie about a 
writer.  Both movies spend enormous effort on side issues, while never 
bothering to give us examples of the writer's work product until the 
very end.  In both cases, all we get is the briefest of excerpts.  
BEFORE NIGHT FALLS spends considerable time convincing us that Reinaldo 
is gay just as FINDING FORRESTER works hard to show us what a dedicated 
basketball player their writer is.</P>
<P>Sean Penn and Johnny Depp lend their names to the picture by turning in 
some nice cameos.  See if you can recognize them.  The rest of the 
supporting cast isn't the least bit memorable.</P>
<P>Schnabel makes some unusual and frequently unsuccessful choices.  The 
movie is mainly in English, but, capriciously and sporadically, the 
characters begin to speak Spanish with English subtitles.  His use of 
grainy archival footage is the most successful as it gives the movie 
more authenticity than any of the acting.  The picture's lead, Javier 
Bardem, keeps the same withdrawn look throughout.  His lack of energy 
and the director's languid pacing make for tedious viewing.</P>
<P>We are reminded of Castro's persecution of anyone deemed 
counter-revolutionary, such as writers or homosexuals, of which Reinaldo 
was both.  One potentially harrowing event is Reinaldo's unsuccessful 
attempt to float to Florida in an inner tube.  Schnabel, however, 
doesn't have a clue as to how to stage this.  One minute Reinaldo is 
leaving, and the next has him back again.  Boy, that was dramatic.  The 
only interesting part is one camera angle taken from the inner tube's 
viewpoint.</P>
<P>The movie is filled with lost opportunities.  One political propaganda 
billboard reads "Duty Begins When Friendship Ends."  Rather than build 
on the indoctrination issue, the story tosses it out and then drops it.  
Similarly, we have a quasi-trial in which one poet is forced to confess 
to his poetry "crimes" against the state.  But after showing it, this 
isn't properly developed either.</P>
<P>What we are left with are some wonderful images and a terrific and 
eclectic score that includes the adagio from Mahler's 5th -- always a 
good choice.  My favorite of the visuals involves an escape effort by 
hot air balloon.  As the balloon rises from the ruins of an abandoned 
and roofless church, we get the aerial view of a would-be political 
refugee fleeing the ravages of communism.  But, like most escapes, it 
fails.  The movie is like that.  Lots of good images surrounding a 
failed attempt at storytelling.  </P>
<P>BEFORE NIGHT FALLS runs a long 2:13.  Part of the film is in Spanish 
with English subtitles.  It is rated R for strong sexual content, some 
language and brief violence and would be acceptable for high school 
seniors and older.</P>
