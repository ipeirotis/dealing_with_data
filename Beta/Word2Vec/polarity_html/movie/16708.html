<P>On the Buckmaster scale of 0 stars (bomb), to 5 stars (a masterpiece): 
4 stars</P>
<P>Their are quirky films, and then their is Rushmore, a film that is intent on
deviating from the norm of filmmaking. The "hero" of this story is unlike any
other in recent memory. Geeky but sort of cool Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman,
in a bold debut performance) is a wacky protagonist, a guy with a mean
attitude but a soft center.  Playing alongside Schwartzman is Bill Murray (in
one of his better roles of recent years), who has an equally peculiar
character.  Murray and Schwartzman live out every comedian's dream: they get
to act simultaneously smart and silly, and receive a whole lot of laughs in
the process.  To further compliment the production, Wes Anderson directors
Rushmore intelligently and humorously, whilst not stripping his intelligent
moments of humor, and not making his humor particularly intelligent.</P>
<P>Max is a 10th grader at Rushmore Academy, and for him, school is his life.  He
is involved in numerous extracurricular roles, ranging from captain of the
fencing and debating teams to the founder of the Double-team Dodgeball
Society.  With his thick rimmed glasses, blazer and quick thinking mind, Max
is often thought of as a kid genius.  Truth is, he's a lousy student and is
under constant threat of expulsion.  Max falls in love with a first grade
teacher named Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), and tries to win her over by
hatching various plans.  When Latin classes are about to be replaced by
Japanese, Max cleverly makes the subject compulsory for all senior years;
later, he attempts to construct an aquarium on Rushmore's baseball field.</P>
<P>For help raising money, Max consults school benefactor Mr. Blume (Bill
Murray), a seedy millionaire who appears to be in the middle of a mid-life
crisis.  Blume is attracted to Max's energy and eccentric ways, and the two
become good friends.  But when Max discovers that Blume is also in love with
Miss Cross, a mean war initiates between the two (at one stage, Blume runs
over Max's bicycle, so Max removes the brakes from his car).  As Max
desperately attempts to act like an adult, Blume finds excitement in acting
like a child.</P>
<P>Almost all of Rushmore's oddly timed humor relies on its characters.  Whilst
we develop a good understanding of Max and Blume's personalities, they are
never predictable and never boring.  The relationship between these two really
needed to work, and it does, much to the credit of Jason Schwartzman and Bill
Murray. Schwartzman's first film performance is a memorable one, and is
skillfully played with a mixture of nastiness and goofy sincerity.  Murray has
received great but small roles recently in Wildthings and Kingpin, but his
work in Rushmore is much closer to what he is capable of achieving.  Murray is
a brilliant comic performer and this film channels his capabilities, producing
a nice bit of whimsical acting.</P>
<P>It's the winning formula of offbeat comedy and drama that makes Rushmore such
a delight to watch.  Wes Anderson's and co-writer Owen Wilson's screenplay is
smart and original - they understand how to craft extraordinary characters,
and have fun doing so.  Though some scenes in Rushmore have little or no
point, the film is always amusing enough to warrant an audience.  Rushmore has
reinvented the teenage comedy genre (similar to what The Breakfast Club did in
1985, and what Can't Hardly Wait attempted to do in 1998) by giving itself a
quirkiness and originality that is rarely found in contemporary cinema.  There
are more reasons to see Rushmore other than its originality, but none are
quite as refreshing.  </P>
