<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A precious and unnerving thriller, one that never fails to offer some
kind of Hitchcockian surprise, as the film is unpredictable throughout.
Gene Hackman is brilliant as the loner "electronic surveillance expert,"
who through a slow-process comes to realize that what he is doing isn't
impersonal but has great consequences on both him and the people he
bugs. Hackman, as Harry Caul, lives a very private life, interested only
in his work. He is diligent at his craft, to the point where he is
considered the best in the business. But his view of life has a cold
ring to it, as he believes that human nature and curiosity are not part
of the business. He is first seen on a case, where he has set up
elaborate devices to take pictures from far off and eavesdrop on a
couple, by using two parabolic microphones he himself created, which are
positioned some distance away and a third bugging device carried by Paul
(Higgings), who follows the strolling couple through San Francisco's
crowded Union Square, during noontime, with a shopping bag on his arm
and wearing a hearing aid.</P>
<P>Harry becomes irritated with the quality of work, as he listens to the
tapes from the back of a specially rigged van, trying to block out the
music and din from the lunchtime crowd. His assistant wants to know what
this assignment is about, and Harry responds by telling Stanley
(Cazale), "I don't care what they are talking about, all I want is a
nice fat recording."</P>
<P>The director (Duval) of an unnamed big business has offered to pay Harry
$15,000 to record a conversation between his wife, Ann (Cindy Williams),
and a man named Mark (Forrest), who is apparently her lover. Harry has
no idea what the purpose of the tape is and says he doesn't care.
Concluding the taping of the conversation, as Ann spots Paul following
the couple around. Harry then calls his client from an outside phone,
because he doesn't have a phone at home. He is told by his assistant to
deliver the tapes tomorrow afternoon and returns to his scantily
decorated but heavily alarmed apartment, only to find that the landlord
left a bottle of wine on the floor, for his birthday, by getting into
the apartment with the spare key, something Harry had no knowledge the
landlord had. This upsets Harry more than he is grateful for the gift.</P>
<P>He visits his girlfriend Amy (Garr), by quietly slipping the key in the
door and throwing the door open, entering her abode like he is on a
case. She doesn't even know it's his birthday, as he opens the wine he
just got as a gift. She is glad to see him and starts asking him
personal questions about himself, which makes him feel very
uncomfortable, causing him to leave the warmth of her bed and tell her
he is going, but not before he gives her money for the month's rent.</P>
<P>The secretive Harry is at peace only when he is working. Returning to
his workplace, located in a dinghy warehouse basement, where he keeps
his state-of-the-art equipment. He is at ease again, as he replays the
tapes from the afternoon with Stan, picking up bits and pieces of the
couple's conversation. He is alarmed to hear the couple think that they
might be murdered if her husband got the chance. This troubles Harry,
because he got on tape the liaison they set for Sunday in the hotel,
including room number and time of date.</P>
<P>When he goes to deliver the tapes to the director, he isn't in, but his
assistant Martin Stett (Harrison) is there, and pays Harry off. But
Harry is troubled by this and refuses to release the tapes to anyone but
the director. Leaving the office, he notices on separate floors the
couple he was following.</P>
<P>The story is chilling, creating doubts in Harry's mind, as he recalls
that previously his tapes resulted in the murder of three innocent
people, upsetting him so much, that he left New York. He is an obediant
Catholic and feels troubled about what is churning inside him, seeking
solace in the confession booth. He confesses that he is afraid people
could get hurt by his work and seems perplexed about what to do.</P>
<P>At a convention for surveillance technology people, he meets his peers
in the field, feeling proud that he is superior to them in his
knowledge, but for the first time, it is beginning to sink into him that
he is on the same amoral playing field as they are. This comes about as
he meets one of his competitors, a slimy, overbearing braggart, "Bernie"
Moran (Garfield), who engages Harry in false flattery, trying to get him
to be a partner. Harry has nothing but contempt for him, but he goes
along with him and his own crew, as they meet some women and bring them
over to Harry's workplace. Meredith (MacRae) shows an interest in him
and in his troubled quiet way, he tries to relate to her, expressing
some true feelings to her. To his hurt, it turns out that Moran gave him
a pen, and that was the device used to bug the intimate conversation he
had with Meredith. After he kicks them out, he sleeps with her, but
restlessly tosses in his sleep, as he has a nightmare vision of the
couple being murdered because of him. When he awakens, he finds that
Meredith is gone, along with the tapes.</P>
<P>He is told by Stett that the director has the tapes and will pay him his
money. The murder that takes place doesn't happen as he pictured it and
to the bargain, his soul has been violated and his lifetime of striving
for perfection in his field is questioned, and if that wasn't enough,
someone has outfoxed the master surveillance expert, by planting a bug
in his apartment that even he can't locate where it is. His only solace,
is to sit in his sparse apartment and play the sax.</P>
<P>This somber thriller is a beauty, projecting a maddening character
study, and infiltrating a secretive and cold world, where the
protagonist, a private wire-tapper, has lost his sense of direction,
knowing that one's privacy can so easily be exposed by expert
technicians like himself and be used for any purpose. The acting was
magnificent on all parts, the story was grippingly told, and its
denouement, is the equal of the best thrillers ever made. A unique film,
whose great sound track by Walter Murch, is essential to the plot, as
the technology in the film was the key element in setting-up the very
eerie atmosphere and bleakness associated with a technology used so
despairingly. The film is even more relevant today than it was back in
the 1970s, as the world has become even more so of a place where it is
possible for technology to invade the privacy of any citizen.</P>
