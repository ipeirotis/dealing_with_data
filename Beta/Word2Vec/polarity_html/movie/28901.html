<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>An old-fashioned, above-average heist movie. It covers familiar ground yet
manages to make its shopworn story to appear fresh, but does not break new
ground in the caper genre. This one, besides having a tight script, has three
terrific actors who cover three different generations. There's the 77-year-old
Marlon Brando as Max; the middle-aged Robert De Niro as Nick; and, the young
up-and-coming star of that magnitude, Edward Norton as Jackie. The director,
Frank Oz ("Bowfinger"), a onetime Muppeteer whose main body of work has been
comedy, deserves credit for keeping the action suspenseful and the long scenes
without dialogue interesting. There seemed to always be something intriguing
going on. </P>
<P>The stylish Nick operates a jazz club in Montreal, has a beautiful stewardess
girlfriend Diane (Bassett), and for the last 25 years only cracks safes that are
not in Montreal. He promises Diane that this will be his last heist and he will
retire to live with her legally as man and wife. She kisses him tenderly,
otherwise her role is insignificant through no fault of hers. </P>
<P>Nick's contact man is the rotund crime boss, Max, who has set him up with deals
for all those years. He comes to him with a big deal, something he is willing to
pay him 4 million dollars for. He's to heist an invaluable scepter from the
coronation of a French queen in 1661 and he's to work with an 'inside man' on
the job named Jackie. He works as a retarded janitor in the impenetrable
Montreal Customs House, under the name of Brian. That happens to be where the
treasure is stored. </P>
<P>The three main characters are perfect in their understated performances: The
plodding, close-mouthed Nick wants the one big score to retire in style and pay
the mortgage off on his jazz club; Max has been around too long and can't do
things himself anymore, so he has to lie then beg Nick to do this job for him,
as otherwise the city's crime boss will kill him for not paying off his huge
debts; Jackie is a brash, intense and cocky loner, who gets off on the wrong
side of Nick by trying to fool him with his spastic Brian routine and for later
on carrying a gun when they buy security information from a hacker. </P>
<P>Nick has his own reliable team to work with: there's a nerdy hacker named
Stephen (Jamie Harrold), who lives in his cyberspace-designed basement and
constantly has a nagging mother shouting down to the basement for him to come up
for air. Nick's security man is the burly Burt (Gary Farmer), who has a close
and trusted relationship with his boss. </P>
<P>Most of the thrills come by way of the heist and the mechanics of it, and the
possibilty of double-crosses and foul-ups. It all depends on Jackie and Nick
working together as a team, and if they can get the scepter out of its secure
safe in the basement of the Customs House without being spotted by the elaborate
security system in place. Nick must also make it through a labyrinth of tunnels
to escape, while Jackie/Brian must keep his supervising janitor (Soles) away
from the scene of the crime. </P>
<P>"The Score" does what it sets out to do, which makes it a diverting heist flick.
It leaves no messages and no unnecessary violence, but it holds one's attention
for the two hours it plays and afterwards you will remember this one as a pretty
good heist flick that had three notable actors in it who performed the proper
nuances called for by the script. The film proves to be a solid effort, but it
lacks the imagination and moody darkness of the human spirit to take it to a
Melville level in noir caper flicks. Everyone in on the caper could have been in
on a venture capital deal just as easily as on a heist, which makes their
characters only superficially appealing. </P>
