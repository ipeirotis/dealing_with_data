CHOCOLAT (2000)
Reviewed by John Sylva</PRE>
<PRE>Rating: A</PRE>
<P>In Chocolat, a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a 
spinning object of obscure textures, patterns, and lines, hoping she'll be 
able to foresee the kind of chocolate they'll most enjoy.  Some scoff the 
idea, but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds 
up seeing something different than the next, revealing personality traits 
which the person may not have known they had before.  This can easily stand 
as a model for Chocolat as a whole: On the surface, it appears to be a light, 
fluffy fable with no depth or true worth, but when one takes a second, deeper 
look, Chocolat's true colors begin to shine through.  Making a bold statement 
about organized religion and those who practice it, Lasse Hallstrom's 
Chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of 
the best films of the year.  </P>
<P>What gives Chocolat its magic, much like Hallstrom's 1999 winner of two 
Academy Awards, The Cider House Rules, is its willingness to say what's on 
its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences.  The bold and 
honest message Hallstrom conveys with Chocolat will no doubt outrage a select 
group of viewers, but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness 
because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find 
themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness.</P>
<P>Chocolat centers its story around the small French village of Lansquenet, 
where majority rules, and the majority lives by only one law: religion.  The 
bulk of the townspeople (with few exceptions) are preparing for the sacred 
time of abstinence, Lent, but when the independent thinking, seemingly 
non-religious Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk 
(Victoire Thivisol) make the village their home, the people will be tempted 
beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop Vianne 
opens.  Many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by Vianne's opening 
of the chocolate shop just in time for Lent, especially the mayor, Comte de 
Reynaud (a cartoon-like Alfred Molina), who will stop at nothing to put her 
out of business.  On the other hand, the shop is a delight to others, 
including the cranky Armande Voizin (Judi Dench), who sits day by day in 
Vianne's shop, telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached 
relationship with her grandson (Aurelien Parent-Koening), which comes as a 
result of his mother (Carrie-Ann Moss) believing Armande is a bad influence, 
as she does not hold the same, strict religious beliefs that she does.  Also 
a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck Josephine Muscat, whose husband 
is constantly beating her, to whom Vianne offers a home and befriends.</P>
<P>Juliette Binoche is charming and honest as Vianne, genuinely capturing her 
character's determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more 
happy, independent human beings, but most of Chocolat's success is 
unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting 
actresses.  Lena Olin, previously nominated for an Oscar in 1989, deserves 
her second nomination for her earnest, moving portrayal of a lost, scared 
woman torn between staying true to her battering, manipulative husband or 
leaving him to live the life which for which she longs.  Judi Dench is sharp, 
incisive, and occasionally greatly touching as Armande Voizin.  Carrie 
Ann-Moss, in what is likely to be her first largely noticed (and acclaimed) 
role since The Matrix, shows a more solid side of her acting skills not 
previously seen, crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with 
and despises simultaneously.  Victoire Thivisol shows much promise as Anouk, 
a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle 
down.  A trade ad for Chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on 
screen with the tagline: "Five extraordinary women, one extraordinary movie."</P>
<P>That's not to say the men don't do their share, though: Alfred Molina makes 
for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist, Hugh O'Conor adds quite a bit of 
comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is, 
and Johnny Depp gives a strong performance as the pirate Roux, who enters the 
film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of Vianne.  </P>
<P>The technical aspects of Chocolat are strong across the board: Lasse 
Hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care, perfectly balancing 
the elements of each genre to be found within the film.  Cinematographer 
Roger Pratt brings an atmospheric, fairy tale look to the film, and Rachel 
Portman's masterful score is her best and most memorable since The Cider 
House Rules.           </P>
<P>Chocolat, adapted by Robert Nelson Jacobs from the Joanne Harris novel, is a 
wonderful little treat of a film, one that will most likely win over the 
hearts of audiences and the votes of Academy members this winter, and the 
aggressive backing of Miramax Films assures the latter.  While not as 
powerful as The Cider House Rules, Lasse Hallstrom's Chocolat is a film which 
works on all levels-as a drama, a comedy, a fable, a romance, and a fairy 
tale.  And it even lives up to its name: It is delicious to savor the taste 
of, easy to digest, and, like all excellent chocolate, it is memorable for 
days afterward. </P>
<P>THE BOTTOM LINE: Chocolat is pure pleasure.</P>
