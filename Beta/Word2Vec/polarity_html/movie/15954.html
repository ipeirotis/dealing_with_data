<PRE>AMERICAN HISTORY X (1998)

Copyright 1998 Ted Prigge</PRE>

Writer: David McKenna
Starring: Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Avery Brooks, Fairuza Balk,
Beverly D'Angelo, Stacy Keach, Jennifer Lien, Ethan Suplee, Guy Torry,
Eliott Gould, William Russ, Paul Le Mat</P>
<P>It's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so
ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone, but by god,
"American History X" does it, and for that, I commend it.  It not only
takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi
skinhead, a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone
who's not what they are, and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it
off.</P>
<P>The subject of this film is one of them, but he is worse than one of the
blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the
leader of the pack.  He's the one who instigates them to take a firm
grip onto their rage, and then in another brilliant stroke, justifies it
with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks.  He's
so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions
that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the
rehabilitation process.</P>
<P>His name is Derek Vinyard, and he's played by Edward Norton with so much
fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and
arresting a public speaker as, say, Malcom X.  When we first see him,
he's clean shaven, with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left
breast, a devlish goatee, and he's attacking the black carjackers
outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and
carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets,
at least when he doesn't need them.  He so believes in his convictions
that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test, even if he knows it
will mean a stop in prison, if only for a couple years.</P>
<P>"American History X" is about Derek, how he became a neo-nazi skinhead,
how he rose to power, how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering
two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of
his car and more to do with proving himself, and how he tried to save
others, namely his younger brother, from making the same mistake.  We
see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager, a vicious hate
monger, a man having an epiphany, and the man who tries to correct what
he's done before - and in all of these, we get a portrait of a man from
all sides.  Or at least, that's the intention.</P>
<P>The film's framing device is his brother, Danny (Edward Furlong,
perpetually looking about 13), also now a skinhead, and how his
principal, Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks, who I just found out was or is the
captain on Star Trek's Deep Space 9), is trying to "correct" him.  When
the film opens, Danny has just written a book report on "Mein Kampf,"
landing him in trouble with Sweeney, which causes him to make him write
a paper on Derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere.</P>
<P>Coincidentally, this day is the day Derek is released from prison, and
when we see him, he's cleaned-up, not as buff, and has a full head of
hair.  He's just as intelligent, but still very rough along the edges,
but he's wisened up.  He's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks
and jews, and tries to persuade Danny, who's becoming what Derek was
before, to give up his lifestyle.  But Danny won't.  He goes to a large
skinhead beer bash, meets with the skinhead leader (Stacy Keach), and
then discovers that Derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it
a couple of years ago.</P>
<P>The film circles around this, then spins off into non-linear flashbacks,
all done in black and white.  We mostly see Derek at his prime as a
skinhead, living in Venice Beach, organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic
raids on local stores that no longer hire the white, middle-class
teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the
same work, and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how
illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this
country was built on.  To them, the white man is the one who has gotten
the fuzzy end of the lolipop, and he not only speaks elloquently,
forcefully, and intelligently, but he backs everything up with political
reasons, justifying their rage at least to them.  And frighteningly
enough, much of what he says sounds true.</P>
<P>"American History X" is a collection of really great scenes and moments,
rather than a cohesive, great film that flows effortlessly from one
moment to the next.  In it, there are some of the best scenes I've seen
all year.  One scene features a dinner between Derek's family, and his
mother's newest boyfriend (played with reserve by Eliott Gould), a
jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with Derek's rightist views,
launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled
emotions in the audience (Gould's reaction to Derek's final summation is
unnerrving).  Another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to
build a friendship and a nice connection between Derek and a black
co-worker (Guy Torry) while folding laundry in prison.  And another
soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two: the murder of the two
black men that winds Derek in jail, which contains a final murder so
nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year.</P>
<P>There's much more to appreciate, like the acting, which is uniformly
good, with stand-outs coming from Avery Brooks, Beverly D'Angelo (as the
long-suffering mother), and Gould (who has one horrible line, but other
than that, comes off with the best performance he's given in what seems
like a really long time).  Norton walks off with the film, though,
coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an
adequate job to rubble.  In only the fifth movie of his career, Norton
has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of
his generation, and maybe the best.  There's nothing like it when Norton
really gets rolling in this movie, spewing out lines with such authority
that he commands all attention from the audience, coming off with power
similar to that of a young Maron Brando.  That he allows the little
emotions to seep through is amazing.</P>
<P>Sadly enough, this isn't going to be the great portrait of racism that
it perhaps hopes to be.  It's too unambitious and even a little
contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an
emotional masterpiece.  The ending, especially, is pencilled in from
other movies, tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced
upon.  Some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches (Kevin Smith
regular Ethan Suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the "Fat Skinhead,"
whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more),
and even the dramatic arc isn't as well travelled.  Furlong's Danny
never seems to really be learning a lesson, since the flashbacks refuse
to show his point of view, and when he decides to make a change by the
end (which was inevitable), it doesn't seem like it has actually arrived
there.  Even Derek's descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justified.
Though his fireman father (William Russ, the dad from "Boy Meets World,"
and don't ask me how I know that) is killed by a black junkie, and even
before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently, there never
seems to be any real back story why Derek became so intense about his
beliefs.</P>
<P>As such, one can see why the director, Tony Kaye, wanted to have his
name removed.  Sorta.  "American History X" is a very good movie, and I
was very moved by it, but it could be a lot better, and the problem
seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his
potential.  Somewhere, he claims, there lies a Tony Kaye cut, and that
was to be the true cut until it was viewed by Norton, who then ordered
another cut, and that is thus.  Although he aimed for the directing
credit to go to "Alan Smithee," the resident name for any film that is
to be disowned by its director, it wasn't allowed to him, under the
grounds that once you disown a film, you can not badmouth it (but
really, that's the MacGuffin - no one really wanted a film this good to
be given the Alan Smithee sign of disapproval).</P>
<P>Kaye's right in that it's not up to par, even if he's not referring to
normal par but rather his own personal par.  This will not be a "Do the
Right Thing" for the late 90s.  Yet it still gets its point across
intelligently, and backs it up with its story (its message, that one
cannot be so enwrapped in one's own beliefs or pain and suffering will
occur, is literally said over the narration, unfortunately).  And even
if it isn't perfect, at least when Avery Brooks turns to Norton after he
has been beaten and raped in prison, and asks him if anything he's done
has made his life any better, it realy hits a nerve, not only in Derek,
but also in the audience.</P>
