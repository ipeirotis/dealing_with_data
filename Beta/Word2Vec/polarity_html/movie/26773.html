<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Lars von Trier (Breaking the Waves/The Idiots), one of the Danish
founders of Dogme '95, that gimmicky method of filming only with certain
sparse cimematic rules, creates this film  in drab digital video and
with a hand-held camera. He has the flair for showbiz promoting, and has
created a film that pulls every string in the book Hollywood wrote about
making tearjerkers, but without the love for those musicals that a
Jacques Demy had when he revitalized the Hollywood musical with his
brilliant "Umbrella's of Cherbourg." This film is a captivating love it
or hate it musical melodrama, one that should divide its audience to
either pole, that unfairly pulls cards out of its sleeve to make sure
its case against the death penalty can't lose. The film itself, tries to
show America as a country of harsh laws and questionable values, where
its capitalistic system forces people to make bad decisions about what
is important in life. If there's any explanation for this Eastern
European looking musical used by von Trier (the 'von' part of his name
was not given but added by him for whatever reason) as a satire on
Hollywood, it is that von Trier's parents were communists and he was
raised to think that the Hollywood musical was a result of bourgeois
decadence.</P>
<P>The story's heroine is played by Icelandic pop singer-composer Bjork,
who won the Best Actress prize at the recent Cannes Film Festival, with
childlike simplicity and unbelievable dumbness on her part, allowing her
character to lack depth. The film won the prestigious Palme d'Or for
Best Picture. Praise from abroad for this film has been far greater than
the less than warm reaction its has gotten from most film critics in the
States.</P>
<P>It is a film about a single mother with a 12-year-old son Gene (Vladica
Kostic) who emigrates to America from communist Czechoslovakia and she
ends up working at a tool-and-die factory, adding to her income by
placing hairpins to cards at home for less than a penny per card. She
saves every cent in a tin can she keeps in a bureau drawer, for an
operation to save her son's sight. She came to America because only the
doctors here can perform such an operation and only here can she make
enough money to pay the hefty doctor bill. Both she and her son suffer
from the same heriditary eye ailment, whereby if they don't receive the
operation they will go blind. She can not save up enough for both
operations and therefore sacrifices herself for her son's sake, but
never tells her son or anyone else about her going blind or how serious
his condition is. Her salvation and only happiness -- is her love of
Hollywood musicals -- as she lives in them in her mind. She also acts in
an amateur theater group, where she has the lead part of Maria in the
musical The Sound of Music. She is accompanied there by her factory
friend Kathy (Deneuve) who sees for herself the trouble she has with her
eyesight and tries to help her in the workplace. They are also seen
together watching old-time Hollywood musicals at a local theater.
Because Selma can hardly see the screen, Kathy must explain what is
happening, which causes a disturbance for a man who is seated in front
of them the both times we see them in the movie house and he reacts each
time to their talking in an irritated way. That scene was a typical
contrived one that von Trier uses, throwing it in the viewer's face that
everything about this film is shamelessly rigged and there's nothing you
can do about it. I got the feeling, that if you don't accept his
world-socialist view of things, you are made to feel like you are on the
wrong side.</P>
<P>The film is set in 1964 in the state of Washington, in an outlying area
of the state, where Selma (Bjork) and her son rent a trailer on the
property of the local policeman Bill (Morse) and his wife Linda (Cara).
The couple seem outwardly friendly to their tenant, offering Selma candy
and giving a bike to Gene so that he can get to school.</P>
<P>One day the troubled landlord Bill tells Selma a secret that he's about
to lose his house because he can't make the payments, something his
spendthrift wife is unaware of, thinking he has a lot of money from an
inheritance. Selma trades secrets with him and tells him about her
impending blindness, and when Bill asks her for a loan soon after they
traded secrets and she said she couldn't, Bill finds where she hid the
money and steals it. Her grief gets piled on, as she gets fired from her
factory job and gives up her role in the play because of her poor
eyesight -- a condition she stubbornly continues to deny to everyone so
as to keep the truth from her son. She even rejects the friendly
romantic overtures from a good-hearted local worker Jeff (Stomare), who
is constantly offering her a ride home.</P>
<P>When Selma goes to get her stolen money back, she encounters a hostile
Linda, who says Bill told her Selma made sexual advances toward him.
When Selma faces Bill, he pulls a gun and pretends that he couldn't
commit suicide, and tells her if she wants the money she better kill
him. After he pulls a gun on her, there's a struggle and he's shot. When
he asks her to kill him, she reluctantly complies, inflicting 34 wounds
in all -- first with the gun and then with the money box slammed into
his skull when she runs out of bullets.</P>
<P>She's arrested for murder, and, after a speedy trial in which her
incompetent court-appointed lawyer does not mention what really went on,
she's sentenced to death by hanging. She won't agree to an appeal
because the new competent lawyer would have to be paid with the money
saved for Gene's operation.</P>
<P>Then the most startling thing about this so far very manipulative and
dull story takes place, flighty song and dance numbers break out
everywhere among the characters, as fantasy and reality get intermeshed,
and original songs written and performed by Bjork and inventively
choreographed by Vincent Paterson are acted out -- where some numbers
take place in the factory, the rehearsal hall, a railroad bridge and the
courtroom. Even the already murdered Bill comes back to life to be part
of the song and dance routines. These numbers were hardly memorable, but
they were attention getting since they didn't fit the action and had a
bizarre look to them. What they all had was a verve, like something
important was happening, rather than the songs and dances being good
music. Yet there was something about this break in the story line that
interrupted the boredom of the story and gave the film renewed life. It
was the only time the film wasn't dried out by the manipulative story
and seemed like a true cinematic fantasy experience. It was the only
thing in the film that seemed to be innovative and chancy, as for once
the director stopped exploiting the poor dumb woman for a brief respite,
before carrying on with making her into a martyr. He did that in the
film's final scene, where he exploits her suffering for one more time,
as he shows her scared of dying, comforted only by a sympathetic prison
guard, who leads her gently to the execution rope, where we needlessly
see the entire horrific hanging.</P>
<P>I don't think the director made his point that well against the death
sentence by making the trial and her death such a blatant mockery. All
those scenes were obviously phony, a set-up for the director to force
his beliefs down the viewer's throats. Everything about this film was
unreal and embedded with such an effete snobbishness to show only its
view was the right one about how the system works. It seems as if von
Trier is, as always, the ego-driven publicist and never the artist first
and he is always seeking to gain attention for his views about society,
without giving me the sense that he really cares about what he is
railing against. I never for one moment in this film thought he cared
about Selma's suffering, her blindness, or that he viewed any of the
workers with real understanding. His point of how economic conditions
makes one a murderer seemed too simple a generalization to take
seriously. It also seems to me that he used the hanging only because
without it he couldn't finish the job he had of exploiting her suffering
to the extreme. Billy Wilder in his "Double Indemnity" didn't have to
use the electric chair to get across his point about how the justice
system operates, neither was it used by Tay Garnett in his superior 1946
"The Postman Always Rings Twice." Both films in their earnest telling of
a real story, make a better argument than von Trier does against capital
punishment, even though he uses every heart-tugging trick there is to
make his case. He does this because what he really believes, is that he
must shock an audience in order for his film to work, he doesn't seem to
be able to operate in any other way. The best I can say for him about
this film, was that as trying as it was to watch it and as difficult as
it was not to feel exploited by the story, his film had a quality about
it that kept connecting with so many things that are interesting, that
despite the dullness of the film and despite my resentment at his
methods of filming, I was still enthralled about the film. But I have
come to think of him now, after watching his film career evolve, as less
of an artist and more of a showman. He is certainly not another Danish
Carl Dreyer, who was always a filmmaker first.</P>
<P>They speak English in this film, but the film doesn't feel like an
American one. It has the  static energy of a film made in communist
Czechoslovakia. Von Trier has never been to America and most of the
actors in this film are foreigners, and the story is not a very
believable presentation of America and how its judicial system works,
unless you want to take extreme cases as the rule. For von Trier, taking
an extreme case gives him just what he is looking for, not a chance to
search for the truth, but a chance to make a splash. With this film, he
is the one dancing in the darkness, but brazen enough to give one the
impression that he is re-inventing cinema. I take him for a charming
huckster, with enough vitality in his films to pull the hustle off. I
just don't trust him as a filmmaker. This is the most exploitive and
least riskiest film he has made to date, in my humble opinion. It is not
daring to be against the death penalty with the evidence he stacked up
against it here. The only risk he took in this film, is that he would
torture the viewer to death by all his contrivances and the brutally
slow-pace of the film, and by the song lyrics being so empty a gesture
to Hollywood, and therefore there is the possibility of him not making
the 'big bucks' he envisioned by bringing his act to America.</P>
