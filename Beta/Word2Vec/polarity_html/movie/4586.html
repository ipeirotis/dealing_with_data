<P>     On the surface, it sounds like a good idea to satirize the numerous 
black urban films that have reached movie screens since the release of 
John Singleton's groundbreaking BOYZ 'N THE HOOD.  The failure of this 
movie, therefore, has less to do with the premise than with the 
execution.  Probably the most inventive aspect of Shawn and Marlon 
Wayans' DON'T BE A MENACE TO SOUTH CENTRAL WHILE DRINKING YOUR JUICE IN 
THE HOOD is the title.  Rather than going for biting, hard-hitting 
satire, this movie constantly takes the easy way out -- cheap, tired 
gags that the viewer can see coming.  Moments worth more than a strained 
chuckle are disappointingly few.</P>
<P>     Watching DON'T BE A MENACE, I was strongly reminded of Mel Brooks' 
recent spate of lackluster comedies (SPACEBALLS, LIFE STINKS, ROBIN 
HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS, DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT).  This film has much 
the same level of humor -- stale, obvious, and only occasionally funny.  
In fact, given a similar concept, Brooks probably would have come up 
with something similar to DON'T BE A MENACE. </P>
<P>     At one point or another, DON'T BE A MENACE offers a parody of just 
about every inner city drama of the '90s.  Singleton's work is the most 
frequently targeted:  the storyline is loosely based on BOYZ 'N THE 
HOOD, there's a scene featuring a girl reading a poem while music from 
POETIC JUSTICE plays in the background, and Omar Epps has a cameo on his 
way to HIGHER LEARNING.  The most involving part of DON'T BE A MENACE is 
identifying the many references to previous films.</P>
<P>     The two Wayans, best known from IN LIVING COLOR, play friends 
Ashtray and Loc Dog, a couple of high school kids roaming the hood, 
getting shot at, impregnating girls, and being put in their place by a 
tough-talking, trigger-happy granny.  DON'T BE A MENACE comes across as 
a poor sister to Keenan Ivory Wayans' I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA.  It has a 
similar style, but isn't as amusing.  SUCKA was no masterpiece, but its 
uneven sendup of Blaxploitation pictures boasted several inspired comic 
sequences.</P>
<P>     That's not to say that DON'T BE A MENACE doesn't have its moments.  
A few scenes stand out.  One lampoons STAND BY ME.  Another has a 
grocery store owner watching Ashtray and Loc like a hawk while a neatly-
dressed white guy robs her blind.  A third has LA cops playing the 
"Rodney King video game".  Beyond that, though, all that DON'T BE A 
MENACE offers is a tremendous quantity of lame jokes.  There are laughs 
to be had, but not enough to lift this film out of its morass of 
mediocrity.  Unfortunately, this is recycled -- not cutting-edge -- 
humor.  </P>
