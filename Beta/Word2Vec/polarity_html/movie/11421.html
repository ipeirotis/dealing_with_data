<PRE>HUSH
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * 1/2* out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>One of the 90s' most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave:
it's the "___ from Hell" movie!  Starting in the early nineties, we were
subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of
relationships-from-Hell!  There were Boyfriends from Hell, Friendly
Neighborhood Cops from Hell, Nannies from Hell, and even Secretaries
from Hell.  But Hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten
in the rush:  The Mother-In-Law from Hell!!!!!</P>
<P>The mother-in-law in question is Martha, played by Jessica Lange. She
has been single-handedly running the family horse farm, Kilronan. Her
son, Jackson (Johnathon Schaech) and his girlfriend, Helen (Gwyneth
Paltrow), live in New York, and have no intention to move back down
south to the rural Kilronan.  But those intentions are about to change.</P>
<P>You see, Martha lives by manipulation.  She has used it in years past to
breed many championship horses.  Now, she believes she can use it to
breed herself a grandson.  Though at first, Helen finds Martha charming,
soon she is caught in the domineering Martha's web of deception.</P>
<P>It's hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to Martha' schemes. As
written, most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted.
But then, the film even treats the audience like idiots.  It tries to
get away with things (like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a
rather unlikely place) without even batting an eye.  Then again an
audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn't one that's
likely to question details.</P>
<P>Jessica Lange's Martha is the only semi-developed character in the film,
and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can. A character
that could have been simply awful is merely groan-worthy. Gwyneth
Paltrow doesn't have much to build upon, as Helen's only character trait
seems to be "daughter-in-law".  Still, she fares better than Johnathon
Schaech, whose character is so nonexistent, he's inexplicably missing
for much of the film.</P>
<P>Still, there have been much worse "____ from Hell" films.  Even with its
paper-thin characters and ludicrous setups, Hush manages to create a few
thrills in a color-by-numbers fashion.  You know what's coming, but
occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two.  The old formulas are
around for a reason, but that doesn't mean they taste fresh.</P>
