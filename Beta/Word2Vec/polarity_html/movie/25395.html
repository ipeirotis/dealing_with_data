<PRE>*1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Year: 2000. Starring Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger, Robert Forster, Chris
Cooper, Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee, Jerod Mixon, Michael Bowman,
Traylor Howard, Tony Cox. Written by Peter Farrelly, Mike Cerrone, and
Bobby Farrelly. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly. Rated R.</P>
<P>It seemed like the perfect concept. What better for the Farrelly
Brothers, famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive
subject matter, than to make a movie about a guy with a split
personality? It's exactly the sort of thing the Brothers relish:
poking fun at something serious (in this case mental illness), throwing
all care to the wind to get a laugh. Jim Carrey's signed on too?
Even better. The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill even helped out
by levying complaints against the Brothers' new film before its
opening, claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split
personality, labeling it incorrectly as "schizophrenia," and so forth.
Such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would, of course,
only add more fuel to the Farrelly Brothers' fire, proving that
some people just couldn't take a joke, and that the Farrellys would
be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their
brilliantly subversive comedy.</P>
<P>Yes, it all seemed perfect, but one thing went wrong: Their movie
isn't funny.</P>
<P>It's not for lack of trying. The Farrellys utilize in "Me, Myself &
Irene" their most high-concept premise ever: Carrey plays Charlie
Baileygaites, a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo
driver, decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and
never release them. This, of course, means all his neighbors exploit his
entirely too-forgiving nature, making his job as a Rhode Island state
trooper increasingly difficult. Soon enough, Charlie's repressed
aggression manifests itself into a second, independent personality named
Hank, a deep-voiced, boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive
actions his predecessor had been unable to muster. This guy isn't
above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which
he's been insulted, or holding a little girl's head
underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street.</P>
<P>Then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the Farrellys
have ever attempted, and the film runs off its tracks. Some have
suggested that this isn't a problem, because the Farrelly
Brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work.
They're wrong, of course: Plot was greatly instrumental in building
up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the Farrellys'
last effort, 1996's "There's Something About Mary."
(1999's "Outside Providence" was technically an earlier project.)
The brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it
contained outrageous gags (despite what some newsmagazine articles would
have you believe), but rather because its most outrageous gags were
entirely unexpected. In "Mary," the Farrellys managed several times to
pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick: They'd have you thinking the
story was going one way, then reveal its real direction in delightfully
surprising fashion.</P>
<P>"Me, Myself & Irene," by contrast, seems to have been made by folks who
looked at "Mary" and saw only the surface grossness, missing all of the
subtle machinations that really made it work. Having been produced by the
same guys who made "Mary," "Irene" seems like an even bigger
disappointment. The brothers pile on the offensive humor, taking shots at
race, midgets, albinos, mental illness, and all manner of bathroom jokes.
But they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh most
of "Me, Myself & Irene" comes off as rote, by-the-numbers, adolescent
comedy. The plot, with Carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive Irene P.
Waters (Renee Zellweger), who's in more trouble than anyone knows,
back to New York, has an ending that's entirely predictable from
the get-go. (Think Charlie and Irene will fall in love? Yeah, me too.)
The Farrellys then introduce scores of different characters, and none of
them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them
to do, no matter how outrageous their actions might be. Compared to the
curveballs the Farrellys are used to throwing, this stuff is almost
entirely soft-tossed, presenting an obvious problem: When gross-out humor
loses its shock value, it's no longer funny, merely gross.</P>
<P>The jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness
runs dry. Take, for example, the subplot involving Charlie's three
Black sons (Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee, Jerod Mixon). The
incongruity of it all is funny for a while, with three burly Black men
discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread Carrey mouthing
said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face. But by the
end of the film, they're still doing the same schitck it
hasn't been elevated to another, funnier level, and it hasn't
been dropped either. That's too bad, because it ceases to be
amusing about halfway through. "Me, Myself & Irene" reeks of wasted
opportunities. There ought to be more focus on how other people react to
Charlie's new personality, and on how Charlie deals with the
consequences of Hank's actions. This doesn't really happen
nearly every supporting character learns about Charlie's condition
early on, so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it.
The film throws what looks like a patented Farrelly curve in a scene
towards the midway point (involving an albino companion Charlie and Irene
pick up called, appropriately, "Whitey"), but the script doesn't go
anywhere with it, instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before
awkwardly tying it up during the climax.</P>
<P>Jim Carrey is a gifted comedian, both physically and vocally, but
he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a
manner similar to Steve Martin in "All of Me." It's a great
showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting, but none of it is
terribly funny. Carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't
expect him to pull, and the Farrellys' script doesn't give
him anything else to pull: The situations in which he must perform the
role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way. Perhaps Carrey
can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better.
Zellweger's Irene is not a strong female lead Mary in "Mary" may
have been part adolescent fantasy, but she was also intelligent and
strong-willed. Irene is nothing in particular, as the film never makes
clear whether she's ditzy, clever, or neither. As such, she gives
us nothing to latch onto as the only "sane" person in the film. Chris
Cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt FBI agent, and his
character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this. He, like
the others, does absolutely nothing unexpected.</P>
<P>After viewing the shapeless mess that "Me, Myself & Irene" eventually
dissolved into, I was stuck wondering whether or not the Farrellys had
outsmarted themselves. Maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so
long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked. But I
don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their
audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style. If the
Farrellys are indeed good, smart filmmakers (and I still think they are),
they'll rebound just fine. Even after that happens, though,
I'll still consider "Me, Myself & Irene" to be a high-caliber
misfire.</P>
