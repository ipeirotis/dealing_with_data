<P>     The characters of James Mangold's debut feature, HEAVY, are the 
flotsam and jetsam of life -- men and women left scattered and forgotten 
on the beach of Pete and Dolly's Restaurant, a Hudson Valley roadhouse 
where a smile is just about the last thing anyone expects to see.  No 
one here is happy or well-adjusted.  Each character has problems, some 
of which we're told very little about, but the common denominator is 
that they all view life as something to be endured rather than 
experienced.</P>
<P>     The roadhouse is owned and run by Dolly Modino (Shelley Winters), 
an aging woman with a variety of health difficulties.  Dolly spends much 
of her time reminiscing about the past when her husband was still alive.  
For her, the present is almost as unpromising as the future.  Delores 
(Deborah Harry) is a frumpy waitress who has engaged in a fifteen-year 
war of words with Dolly.  Life-weary and looking for a little affection, 
Delores drifts from day-to-day, not seeming to care what comes next.  
Leo (Joe Grifasi) is Pete and Dolly's most loyal customer, a perpetually 
drunk loser who hangs around the roadhouse hoping that Delores will 
agree to take him home.  Callie (Liv Tyler) is the new employee, a 
college dropout in need of money who is saddled with a loutish boyfriend 
and may or may not be pregnant.  </P>
<P>     Then there's Victor (Pruitt Taylor Vince), the film's protagonist.  
Painfully shy and convinced that his overweight condition makes him 
unattractive, Victor lives in the shadow of his mother, Dolly.  He's the 
restaurant's cook and the object of Delores' affection.  But, with the 
arrival of Callie, Victor finds something to brighten up his days.  He 
is instantly smitten with her, and, when she has a few kind words for 
him and seems interested in a friendship, Victor is eager to oblige.  
Nevertheless, his feelings for Callie, which are clearly not 
reciprocated on the same level, will seemingly lead to inevitable 
heartbreak.  </P>
<P>     Where FORREST GUMP was the fantasy, HEAVY is the reality.  Victor 
is a Gump-like character -- slow-witted and likable.  However, while 
Robert Zemeckis' 1994 blockbuster gave us a triumphant fairy tale, HEAVY 
gives us a near-tragedy.  Forrest got Jenny; the closes Victor comes to 
winning Callie is in his fantasies.  Writer/director Mangold never 
compromises the integrity of his painfully-intense script.  There isn't 
one crowd-pleasing moment in the entire movie, except perhaps the last 
scene, which offers a flicker of hope.</P>
<P>     Much of HEAVY is about communication, or, more appropriately, the 
lack thereof.  Circumstances and choice have created walls of isolation 
around each of the characters.  At times, their inability to break 
through these barriers is maddeningly frustrating -- much as it was in 
1992's UN COEUR EN HIVER, the French film about a man who suppresses all 
of his feelings.  In HEAVY, we sense that Victor would like to express 
himself, except he either doesn't know how or is so insecure about 
himself that the fear of rejection keeps him quiet.  </P>
<P>     Dialogue is sparse in HEAVY, so it's left up to the actors to form 
and develop their characters with mannerisms and facial expressions 
instead of scripted lines.  Considering that the cast is not made up of 
"great" names, this is a daring move by Mangold.  Fortunately, it pays 
off, largely due to a gargantuan performance by Pruitt Taylor Vince 
(NOBODY'S FOOL), who creates a heartwrenchingly sympathetic man we can't 
help caring about.  Deborah Harry is also good, giving us the kind of 
waitress who would have made FRANKIE AND JOHNNY a memorable movie.  Liv 
Tyler (STEALING BEAUTY) gets by more on looks than ability, but she has 
her moments.  And Shelley Winters is refreshingly low-key.</P>
<P>     HEAVY is not the kind of film to view when you're looking for 
something upbeat.  It's too real, and, as a result, potentially too 
painful.  On the way out of the theater, I heard someone remark, "Why 
did I just sit through that film?  I've lived that story, and I don't 
need to be put through it again!"  Mangold captures the nuances of life 
perfectly, and, by never cheapening his vision through facile 
resolutions, he fashions a memorable cinematic portrait.  Ultimately, 
HEAVY's considerable weight has little to do with what the scale says 
when Victor steps onto it.  </P>
