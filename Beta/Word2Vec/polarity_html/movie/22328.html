<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The 81-year-old Boris Karloff's last completed feature film, could have
and should have been better, as it suffers from a weakly-crafted script
despite having great performances from the three prominent horror screen
favorites who are in it- that would be Karloff as Professor Marshe,
Christopher Lee as Morley, and Barbara Steele as Lavinia. Though, it is
still worth seeing because of its star attractions and its innovative
psychedelic offerings to the horror genre.</P>
<P>Robert Manning (Eden) discovers that his brother Peter is missing after
going to Craxted Lodge in the village of Greymarsh to purchase antiques
for their business in London, and decides to go there himself to see if
he can locate him. His gracious and sophisticated host, Morley, puts him
up for the night in his splendid mansion, a must prop for any horror
film of this nature. It seems that Bob's visit is at a very festive
time, it is the day that the townspeople celebrate the death of the
local witch Lavinia which took place in January of 1652.</P>
<P>Bob first meets the lovely Eve (Virginia) when he goes to Morley's house
to question him about his brother. She lives at her uncle's house and is
wildly partying there with friends, as the two meet and look into each
other's eyes and have an instant physical attraction for each other.</P>
<P>When Bob can't get anywhere in tracing his brother, he questions
Professor Marshe, a visitor in the Morley house, who is an expert on
witchcraft. He tells the innocent young man, whose family originally
came from this town, the story about the 17th century witch Lavinia, who
claimed that she was innocent after being accused by the town's
establishment, which included Manning's distant relative, who was
actually the main accuser. Rumor has it that she placed a curse on the
town, avenging retaliation against all her accusers. Bob scoffs at the
witch story and the idea of ghosts being around, saying he knows little
about such things. But the professor replies in his noted serious
Karloff movie tone, "When the time comes, your skepticism might be only
a fragile shield."</P>
<P>To add further to the eerie atmosphere, are scenes with foggy winter
nights, a castle with ancient relics, the pitch black skies of the
small-town, and Morley's mentally unbalanced servant, Elder (Gough), who
mysteriously warns Bob to get out before it is too late. He also tells
him to visit a private gravesite to get some answers for what he is
looking for.</P>
<P>Bob's conversations with the wheel-chaired bound professor are terse but
highlight the film, as they are delivered with proper horror film
affect. When he asks the professor, "What do you collect?" He is told,
"I collect instruments of torture."</P>
<P>Bob will have two wonderful scenes where he has hallucinations, and both
these nightmares come after drinking brandy with Morley, which leads one
to suspect the drinks were drugged. In these dreams, he envisions being
led to a courtroom and the costumed Lavinia, whose face is painted, her
lips are ruby red, and she is wearing a golden ram's horn headpiece, and
is trying to get him to sign a book, as she is surrounded by a trial
judge and masked jurors, some in goat's masks and others traditionally
masked for what could be expected at such a macabre event.</P>
<P>In his second dream sequence, he will envision a ring of fire and be
taken away to the same room as before, where he will be stabbed in the
arm by Lavinia, and will go sleepwalking down to the lake, where he is
about to drown himself when the police sergeant (Avon) comes along and
takes him back to the house and to Eve.</P>
<P>Bob discovers a secret passage in his guest room that leads to an attic
space that looks like it is the same one he had in his dreams. With the
help of Eve going to the vicar (Rupert) to trace the records of the
witchcraft trial and with him visiting the professor's house, where he
learns that in witchcraft writing a name in a book is a serious matter
and can't be taken back he, thusly, realizes that he and Eve are in
grave danger.</P>
<P>Boris Karloff becomes the hero of this tale, along with his faithful
mute servant Basil (Warren), as they come just in time to rescue the
innocent duo from a burning house.</P>
<P>The film's not real frightening because there is a flatness to it; but,
it has its entertaining moments, and is a must see for Karloff fans.</P>
