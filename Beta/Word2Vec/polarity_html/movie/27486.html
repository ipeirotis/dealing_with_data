<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Claire Denis (I Can't Sleep/Nenette and Boni/No Fear, No Die) has
created a cinematic work of great poetry and reverie: a masterpiece. It
is a meditation on men of the French Foreign Legion who live as
outsiders on the edge of civilization, who have been reborn with hope
when becoming part of a romantic military organization, thereby
attaining a certain elegance in their lives. The film is loosely based
on Herman Melville's "Billy Budd," though the scenery is now the
isolation of the African desert instead of the sea. There are many films
that influenced Denis, but the works of Alain Renais, especially his
Muriel, probably influenced her the most. It's a film so visually
stunning and so magnificently palpable in its cinematography and in its
lively camera movements and fascinating narrative speculations, and most
of all, in its lyrical sensuality, that it runs poetically adrift with
its listless hypnotic pace, its sparse dialogue forcing the viewer to
see what is not being said, and by its strange brooding mood it sets, as
it tells in a matter of fact tone a story of hate, alienation and envy
through the eyes of the narrow-minded French Foreign legionnaire who
found freedom in his remorse. Its background shots are just as important
as its story line and its theme, as it helps explore the everyday
boredom the men face, of the trite routines the macho men are under, and
the underlying violence it evokes in them.</P>
<P>Every scene in Beau Travail is filled with a quietness that turns
explosive and rattles the wasteland. The minimally told story is made
all the more powerful by many vivid shots, such as the one of the
emerald water contrasted with the barren desert, or of the distant
mountains which seem to have a language of their own that speaks to us
of things we cannot know, or of the unobtrusive native women in their
colorful dresses that we see in the marketplace or at the disco, who
strike a chord in us with their musical gestures and mocking tones. The
local women are just as much a part of the story as anything else in the
film is, even though they are not directly part of the plot. There are
also the close-ups of the interracial legionnaires living as brothers
who have to reinforce this by ritualistically hugging and separating
from each other in what seems to be weirdly homoerotic embraces, but can
also be viewed as a parody of such romantic notions.</P>
<P>All the legionnaires have secret past lives and can choose any name they
want to be known by (one of the main characters is Michel Subor who
chooses the same name he had in Godard's 1960 Le Petit Soldat, Bruno
Forestier, but this time he is playing a different part). The
legionnaires are willingly giving up everything to be accepted into this
arcane masculine fraternity that lives by a code of military honor.</P>
<P>Beau Travail literally means beautiful work, and this film delivers all
that and more. It seems like it has been ages since I have been so
enthused about a film as I am by this one.</P>
<P>The story is narrated by the evil superior sergeant, in an offscreen
voiceover and in a flashback that begins by him stating his time of
action is over, it is time for him to recall his life, as he
says--`Marseilles, late February. I have a lot of time ahead of me.'
He's a loner, a sort of romantic figure despite his unappealing physical
appearance, who thought of himself as the ideal legionnaire, ex-Chief
Master Sergeant Galoup (Denis Lavant), a career soldier in the French
Foreign Legion, stationed in the Djibouti outpost, which is in East
Africa.</P>
<P>His chosen life, one that he feels most suited for, changes for no
apparent reason when he becomes extremely jealous of an innocent new
recruit who comes under his command, Gilles Sentain (Gregoire Colin).
Galoup reminisces, with the help of the diary he kept, about being
booted out of the Legion for his abuse of the popular and compliant
recruit, someone with no guile who only wanted to be a good soldier.
Galoup is not afraid to openly state how he was driven by the twisted
state of his mind to behave in such a maddening way against such a
selfless and blank individual, someone he found hard to believe really
exists.</P>
<P>He tells of almost idolizing his much older commander, Bruno Forestier,
who has no ideals or ambition, and enjoys to sit around and get high
smoking the local gat. Bruno has grown old and tired of life, and in one
conversation he has with the sergeant, he says "If it wasn't for
fornication and blood we wouldn't be here."</P>
<P>Time seems irrelevant for the soldiers, memories seem to come and go, as
they do their military drills looking at times like Teutonic mythical
gods while half-naked (these scenes provoke, mock and remind us of the
Leni Riefenstahl kitsch art and homoerotic heroes she gave us in both
Triumph of the Will and Olympiad--though Denis's characterizations
seemed all the more potent, purposeful and vital). The men also exercise
by performing tai chi and they learn that the most important thing a
legionnaire must know, is to obey his superior officer. To iron a
perfect crease in their uniform is part of their reason for being in the
Legion, because it makes them look special. The boredom of the day is
broken up by work details, while the nights are reserved for the local
discos, where they dance Western style with the ribald African women and
pretend to have found satisfaction with this fantasy arrangement. Beau
Travail is the memories of such idol pleasures and such a need to fit in
somewhere, even if it is into something that appears as useless as the
Legion, which doesn't seem to have any purpose anymore without the days
of French colonization and the Algerian war. The only thing the men
can't let go of is their dreams. The Legion is their love fantasy, it is
something that can't be understood by anyone but true lovers. Trying to
explain their reason for being, is like explaining why Rimbaud became a
slave trader and gave up poetry.</P>
<P>Sentain heroically rescues a helicopter pilot who crashed at sea and
Forestier respects him for being the kind of soldier needed in the
Legion, one who blindly obeys orders and loves to be a soldier for no
other reason. That Bruno takes a liking to him, makes Galoup become
crazed with envy, as he can't believe that Sentain doesn't have an angle
he is working. The sergeant then finalizes his plans to destroy Sentain
by bringing the legionnaires to a desolate spot in the desert, where he
has them dig in the oppressive heat a road that is not needed, as the
locals watch impassively with disbelief. As in Billy Budd, the person in
charge, in this instance the sergeant, creates a situation out of an
injustice to another to provoke the legionnaire to respond and thereby
manuevers the innocent Sentain to act in a humanitarian way, and when he
does the sergeant is there to snap at him and sucker him into punching
him out as he thereby fulfills his plan by sending Sentain out on the
isolated desert alone with only a compass that doesn't work, as his
punishment. The last we see of Sentain, is that the locals have rescued
the unconscious man in the desert and a local woman is nursing him back
to health, as she is with him on a bus.</P>
<P>When told by the commander his days in the Legion are over, there is a
brilliant final scene of the sergeant's visit to the disco where he
breaks free of the self that imprisons him and dances wildly alone to
the contemporary Western song "Rhythm of the Night." Alone in
Marseilles, he wrestles with the motto he has tattooed on his chest
"Serve the good cause and die," and contemplates suicide.</P>
<P>Claire Denis was brought up in a family where her father was a French
civil servant and lived the early years of her life throughout Africa
and in Djibouti. Her familiarity with the people and their landscape and
their customs, is reflective in the truth captured on the screen. This
is her breakthrough genius film, a film that stands heads and shoulders
over the talented director's other films. There's magic in the mystery
her filmmaking evokes and there's something universal she uncovers in
her search for foreignness (goodness!), which is the reason she took
this project on in the first place, at the urging of French TV. What
adds to the film, is the robust musical score of Benjamin Britten's
Billy Budd oratorio and the choreography staged by one of the actors who
played a legionnaire, Bernardo Montet. All the military exercises were
like watching a ballet, as the entire film had the fresh look of
something so beautiful, that it has to be seen.</P>
