<PRE>                              THE SUMMER HOUSE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jeanne Moreau, Lena Headey, Joan Plowright, Julie Walters,
           David Threlfall.
Screenplay:  Martin Sherman.
Director:  Waris Hussein.</P>
<P>     In retrospect, my responses to THE SUMMER HOUSE seem very
confusing.  I did laugh at this lightweight British comedy; in fact, I
laughed quite a lot.  At the same time, I found myself wondering why I
wasn't enjoying it more.  THE SUMMER HOUSE is full of quotable
one-liners, spirited performances and good intentions.  It also never
quite adds up to a satisfying film.  At just under 80 minutes, THE
SUMMER HOUSE leaves some characters sketched in only the broadest of
strokes, and burdens the humor with an unnecessarily dark and
cumbersome story structure.</P>
<P>     Based on the writings of Alice Thomas Ellis, THE SUMMER HOUSE
tells the story of Margaret (Lena Headey), a young Croydon woman whose
marriage to Syl Monro (David Threlfall) is rapidly approaching.  The
small problem in this scenario:  Margaret not only doesn't love Syl,
she doesn't even like him.  Coming off a tragic relationship abroad,
Margaret is cornered into the engagement by her well-meaning but
old-fashioned mother Monica (Julie Walters), and believes there's no
hope for backing out.  Enter Lili (Jeanne Moreau), an old friend of
Monica's visiting for the wedding.  The vibrant and uninhibited Lili
becomes Margaret's confidante, and together with Syl's mother (Joan
Plowright) resolves to see to it that the marriage never takes place.</P>
<P>     Nearly everything that works in THE SUMMER HOUSE is thanks to
Moreau and Plowright.  Yes, they are given good lines by screenwriter
Martin Sherman (the stage play BENT), but the real success is in the
interpretation.  Moreau is mischievous and full of energy, bordering on
over-the-top but just managing to keep the reins on Lili.  She is given
most of the sharpest dialogue, and she uses it to paint a picture of a
woman moving into her later years with a continued lust for life, but
one who never comes off as an arrested adolescent.  Plowright's Mrs.
Monro is generally more subdued, lamenting that "in some cultures, the
elderly throw themselves off ice floes when they're no longer of any
use; unfortunately, there are no ice floes in Croydon."  She's really
quite a lonely and unhappy woman before a drinking binge with Lili
allows her to rediscover a sense of fun, and a purpose in preventing
the disastrous marriage.  These two fine actresses are extremely
entertaining, and THE SUMMER HOUSE might be considered worth seeing
simply for their performances.</P>
<P>     The characters surrounding them aren't quite so worthy of
attention.  Although ostensibly the centerpiece of the story, Margaret
is really very poorly defined.  It's never entirely clear what part the
factors of her mother, her ill-fated Egyptian romance and her desire to
become a nun respectively play in her actions and decisions.  Lena
Headey is a fresh face, but for the most part that face is a frown, and
she never develops beyond her melancholy.  Even more caricatured is
Syl, a womanizing oaf nearing middle age while still living with his
mother.  David Threlfall, who resembles Monty Python's Eric Idle while
playing one of his unctuous game show host characters, really hasn't
got much to do but leer and be slightly off-putting, and his character
makes the situation much more ridiculous than it needs to be.  Even
Julie Walters, a very good actress, is wasted in the role of Margaret's
mother.  There was clearly a great deal of time spent giving these
characters funny things to say, but not nearly as much making them
real.</P>
<P>     Even more distracting than the absence of real characters is the
absence of a coherent plot.  THE SUMMER HOUSE is comprised largely of
snippets of witty conversation, funny in their own right but never
moving towards anything.  The details of Margaret's affair are revealed
in distracting flashbacks, and the entire issue of the marriage seems
sometimes to be in the way of the characters quipping.  There are also
some disturbing undercurrents--intimations of child abuse, an
unexplained violent death--which seem grossly out of place and entirely
unnecessary.  Ultimately, I can give THE SUMMER HOUSE a mild
recommendation because of the laughs it provides, but I was
disappointed by the unrealized potential for something a bit more
human.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 bad marriages:  6.</PRE>
