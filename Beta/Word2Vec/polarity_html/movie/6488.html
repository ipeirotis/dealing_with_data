<P>     It is one of the more trustworthy rules of popular culture that
everything old must eventually become new again, and 1996 at the movies
sure has looked a lot like the mid-70s.  TWISTER and INDEPENDENCE DAY were
less like contemporary action films than the were heirs to the disaster
epics of twenty years ago, with plucky bands of one-dimensional characters
trying to withstand barrages of special effects.  With two volcano films
and James Cameron's TITANIC on the horizon, it is beginning to feel like
Irwin Allen has taken over Hollywood again, and that thought doesn't
inspire much nostalgia.  DAYLIGHT is a POSEIDON ADVENTURE clone with a few
effectively tense moments, but it is so plodding and mechanical that it
is rarely entertaining.</P>
<P>     Sylvester Stallone stars as Kit Latura, a one-time Emergency Medical
Services worker now working as a chauffeur after a tragic accident cost
him his job.  His training will come in handy, however, when a massive
explosion involving toxic chemicals seals off an underwater commuter
tunnel between Manhattan and New Jersey.  With only twelve survivors
trapped in the tunnel -- including struggling playwright Madelyne Thompson
(Amy Brenneman), athletic gear tycoon Roy Nord (Viggo Mortensen) and
transit cop George Tyrell (Stan Shaw) -- Kit attempts a risky entry
through a route from which he will not be able to return.  That leaves him
in danger as well, though the greatest danger isn't entirely clear.  While
rising waters and a collapsing structure place the clock against them, the
group also finds progress threatened by internal dissent, as well as by a
dangerous procedure undertaken by officials on the outside which could
cost everyone their lives.</P>
<P>     DAYLIGHT begins with a couple of red-herring criminal activities
which end up causing the firestorm in the tunnel, but it is indicative of
the shortcomings of the script that the bad guys then become cinders
rather than sticking around to make any more sparks fly.  The survivors
are a predictably motley assortment, with the aforementioned individuals
joined by a few petty criminals, a dysfunctional family and an elderly
couple, and there are several squabbles as they try to decide what to do
and who should lead them.  There simply isn't enough to any of the
characters to give the conflict energy; everything we know about each of
them comes from a series of postage-stamp sized establishing scenes, and
that's not nearly enough.  With the vague bureaucratic malevolence
aboveground and the muted mutineering below ground as the only antagonism
in most of DAYLIGHT, the absence of a real villain becomes a distinct
drawback, and results in a plot which grinds from impossible situation to
yet-more-impossible situation.</P>
<P>     That is not to say that there is no drama in DAYLIGHT, though little
of it comes from the silly dialogue or thin characterizations.
Surprisingly, it also doesn't come from the special effects by Industrial
Light and Magic, which often have a strangely low-budget quality.  The
real drama comes from watching the dirty baker's dozen of our protagonists
realize that their only chance at survival lies in cooperation, and from
the difficult moral decisions of a crisis situation.  Repeatedly,
characters are forced to decide who can be saved, or whether someone is
worth saving, and director Rob Cohen (DRAGONHEART) somehow makes those
moments matter even though individual characters don't. When the entire
group joins together to free one of them trapped under a car, the heroism
of necessity gives DAYLIGHT a boost of substance.</P>
<P>     That alone might be more than you would expect from a Sylvester
Stallone action film, although Sly himself merely seems to be going
through the motions.  Screenwriter Leslie Bohem has handed him a character
which even seems to be a barely re-worked version of his tragedy-scarred,
redemption-hungry role in CLIFFHANGER, and he wanders grimly through most
of the film without showing us any hint of a personality.  He also has to
carry DAYLIGHT on his broad shoulders, because this is one disaster film
which doesn't blow its budget on putting an all-star cast in harm's way;
Amy Brenneman and Viggo Mortensen are no Faye Dunaway and Fred Astaire.
However, DAYLIGHT does try to follow up on one bit of disaster film trivia
-- both THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and THE TOWERING INFERNO won Best Original
Song Academy Awards -- by serving up a sappy romantic ballad called
"Whenever There Is Love."  The female half of the duet?  Donna Summer.
Yes indeed, folks, it sure does feel like the mid-70s all over again.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 tunneling infernos:  5.</PRE>
