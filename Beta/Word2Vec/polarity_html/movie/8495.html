<P>     The Paris of Cedric Klapisch's disarming comedy WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY
is no City of Lights.  Quaint neighborhoods are vanishing as elderly
residents are evicted to make way for upscale cafes and trendy boutiques.
Wrecking crews clear away old buildings to make way for the new.  Lovers
in love have given way to a parade of lonely hearts trying to connect in
bars and alleyways.  Paris has rarely looked more modern -- or less
romantic -- on film.</P>
<P>     This is the Paris discovered by a young single woman named Chloe
(Garance Clavel) when she is forced by the disappearance of her beloved
cat Gris-Gris to get out of her apartment.  Gris-Gris, along with Chloe's
gay roommate Michel (Olivier Py), is one of the few dependable male
figures in her life, giving her plenty of incentive to track him down.
Instead of her cat, however, Chloe finds plenty of reminders that she is
not alone in her loneliness.  Her neighbor Madame Renee (the charming
Renee LeCalm) surrounds herself with pets, another neighborhood woman
(Gisele Laquit) holds conversations with her dead husband's ashes, and a
shy fellow named Djamel (Zinedine Soualem) develops a crush on Chloe while
helping her search for Gris-Gris.</P>
<P>     Though this all may sound quite depressing, it's actually nothing of
the kind.  Klapisch finds none of his subjects pathetic; he looks upon
them with a subtle bemusement, admiring their ability to persevere and to
adapt to the world around them.  He has a particularly good time with
Chloe, played with an arresting sweetness by Garance Clavel.  Some of the
film's cleverest scenes, including a seaside vacation rendered in one
five-second shot of Chloe swimming alone in the ocean, capture Clavel
playing a woman trying to pretend she is resigned to her fate.  The film's
final optimistic note makes her struggles all the more appealing.</P>
<P>     The episodic nature of WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY does grow wearying after a
while, with several encounters dissolving before they even register with
the viewer.  There isn't much narrative momentum to Chloe's adventures --
WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY functions mostly as a walking tour of contemporary
Parisian heartache, emphasis on the "walking" -- but there is a
genuineness to each one.  The many characters in WHEN THE CAT'S AWAY are
looking for love in a lot of the wrong places, but at least most of them
are still looking.  Chloe's quest is really a search for the romantic
Paris of song and story, one which may no longer exist, though it
may please the heart to believe that it does. </P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 cat's meows:  7.</PRE>
