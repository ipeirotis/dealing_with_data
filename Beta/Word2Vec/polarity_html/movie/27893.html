<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The Coen brothers have based their latest film on `The Odyssey' by
Homer. Naturally, coming from them, it is a very loose interpretation of
that Greek classic. Comedy-and-old-fashioned bluegrass and gospel music
are what prevails, what gets left behind is the serious poetry of that
epic work. The film is closer to Preston Sturges's Sullivan's Travels
than it is to Homer. This film even gets its title from the part in
Sullivan's Travels when Joel McCrea, playing a successful director,
wants to stop doing comedy to make instead a serious socially conscious
drama called `O Brother, Where Art Thou?'</P>
<P>The scene is set in Mississippi during the height of the Great
Depression, where three chain gang convicts escape while chained
together. Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) loves to talk fancy
and vainly thinks he's a smart one, and by the process of elimination,
he's the self-proclaimed leader (Ulysses is Roman for Odysseus). Pete
(John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) are dolts and perfect
foils for Ulysses. Pete is easily made a fool of by those who can't
resist how gullible he is and Delmar talks incessantly about getting
back his farm before he can talk about a woman or anything else. The
three of them collectively being dumb-and-dumber-and-dumbest.</P>
<P>The film will display moments of visual splendor and a riot of comedy
coming about through the characterization of the three stooge-like
convicts, but overall the film flags in its effort to make the story
more worthy than a few skits that work.</P>
<P>Since they are chained together, in order to get them all to want to
escape with him, Ulysses makes up a story that he knows where $1.2
million is buried from an armed robbery he committed, which the three of
them call a treasure.</P>
<P>After their escape, they ride away from the nearby prison with a blind
black man (Homer's prophet) driving a railway handcar, who warns them
that they will find treasure out there, but not the treasure they're
seeking.</P>
<P>Seeking shelter with a kin of Pete's, the three are turned in by him to
the sheriff (von Bargen), as he explains these are hard times and I
could use the reward money. But the trio escapes as the place burns down
and the turncoat's kid drives them out of there. The trio will proceed
to get into one adventure after another, as two of them are all excited
about going after the treasure, while Ulysses is more concerned with
tracking down some pomade called Dapper Dan, which makes him smell
pretty and look the way Clark Gable did as a matinee idol. The man with
seven daughters real reason for escaping, is to stop his wife Penny
(Homer's Penelope namesake-Holly Hunter) from marrying a wormy
politician (McKinnon).</P>
<P>On a desrted road, they give a ride to a young black musician, Tommy
Johnson (Chris Thomas King), who says he just sold his soul to the devil
so he could be a great musician, and they decide to go with him into a
rural radio station/recording studio, where they tell the blind radio
manager (Root) that they are a group called the Soggy Bottom Boys. They
cut a catchy country tune and are paid ten bucks each, but tell the
manager there are five of them. They then take off again and are unaware
that the record becomes an enormous smash, with customers requesting the
album that the store owners tell them is all sold out.</P>
<P>On the road again, the three hitchhikers thumb a ride with the excitable
George "Baby Face" Nelson," who is being pursued by the police, with him
firing his Tommy gun from the side of the car at them with tremendous
glee, while also taking time out to kill a cow. After robbing a bank
with him, he deserts them because he feels depressed. Yet, he leaves
them the money from the robbery.</P>
<P>The adventures continue, as the boys are lured into the woods by a trio
of sweet-voiced sirens, and when they wake up the next morning, Pete is
gone. Delmar mistakes the toad in Pete's overalls for Pete. So he
carries the toad around in a shoebox until a one-eyed Bible salesman
(John Goodman as the Cyclops) squeezes the critter to death after
beating the two over the head and stealing their bank money.</P>
<P>The boys run into a heated governor's race that pits the unpopular
incumbent Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning) against a fire-brand reform
candidate (Wayne Duvall) whose motto, `Friend of the Little Man,' is
endorsed by a broom-sweeping midget who accompanies him on his campaign
stops.</P>
<P>The major skit in the film, is a wonderfully choreographed Ku Klux Klan
rally that is disrupted by the boys in a comical fashion. The film
reaches its climactic moment, when
they sing in disguise at a political rally and get recognized with a
standing ovation by the audience as the Soggy Bottom Boys. Durning comes
to their rescue from his KKK opponent, who snarls at the band for being
integrated. Durning goes onstage with them and pardons them for their
past sins, as he is grateful that his political career has been
reinvigorated by his association with the popular singers.</P>
<P>The story seemed to die when it tried to conclude in some sane way, as
the film was played mostly for the comedy, so the story had no emotional
impact or little complexity to it, even though it lightly touched on
racial and religious issues. There were also several obvious references
to Homer's epic, but mostly it was a film carried by the comedy
performances of the three dimwitted characters, with George Clooney
showing he had an old-fashioned charm, much like the old Hollywood
stars, plus he has a good ear for comedy, and showed that he could carry
a film.</P>
<P>Dan Tyminski did the singing for Clooney in the pic, as the trio sang
the fictional hit "Man of Constant Sorrow."</P>
<P>I was somewhat disappointed by this big mess of a film (trying to depict
the Depression-era in the Deep South as in the midst of great social
changes due to anything from its music to the TVA--with comedy being
prescribed as a the cureall for everything). It was amusing and fun to
watch, but could never get over its limitation -- a weak storyline.</P>
