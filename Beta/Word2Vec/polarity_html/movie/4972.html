<PRE>                THE NASTY GIRL (DAS SCHRECKLICHE MAEDCHEN)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     THE NASTY GIRL (DAS SCHRECKLICHE MAEDCHEN) (1990) got an Academy
Award nomination for best foreign film that year.  The film is a most
unusual German comedy about a young woman doing an historic essay about
her village.  It is based on a true story and is a fictionalized
account told in quasi-documentary style.  The woman, Lena Stolze, who
plays the lead of Sonja is simply marvelous; she is wide-eyed,
innocent, and as persistent as they come.</P>
<P>     As the story unfolds, Sonja tells of her fairly idyllic childhood.
The innovative cinematography by Axel De Roche has the present done in
bright primary colors and the flashbacks all in black and white.  The
sets are interesting in that some of the backgrounds are fake backdrops
like you might see used in a play.  Sonja is brought up in a strict
Catholic school where both of her parents teach and where her mother
has to stop teaching when she is pregnant lest one of the children ask
questions about how she got that way.  The school, although religious,
is highly corrupt and the kids whose parents donated the most get shown
the questions to all of the quizzes in advance.</P>
<P>     One day, the German President announces an essay contest with
"Democracy in Europe" as the theme.  Sonja wins first prize in all of
Germany.  She is a hero in her little town, and the local doctor tells
her, "If I'd known you'd be famous, I would have preserved your
appendix in alcohol."</P>
<P>     When the President announces the essay contest for the next year,
everyone tells Sonja she must enter and win again.  This time the theme
is "My Hometown during the Third Reich."  Everyone assumes Sonja will
write a sweet little fluff piece about them, but when she starts
digging into records, they all put up barriers in her way and she can
find out nothing.  It seems the only Nazi supporter in the whole town
was ex-mayor Zumtobel who is now conveniently dead and buried.
Everyone else claims to have spoken up against the Nazis, were freedom
fighters, etc.  When she begins to question their credibility, they get
angry and turn on her.</P>
<P>     Rather than doing this as some pedantic and morose work, great
writer and director Michael Verhoeven instead does it as a funny,
albeit sometimes serious, comedy.  The lies people invent to cover up
their cover up are hilarious.  In a sentence, the film works.</P>
<P>     Well, the townsfolk's stonewalling forces her to blow the deadline
on the essay, but this is not the end.  She goes to college and decides
to write a book on the subject.  She views her quest simply and tells
reporters, "You have to know where things come from to know where they
are going."  After many twists and turns, the way the story is wrapped
up is quite imaginative.</P>
<P>     THE NASTY GIRL is a fast paced movie running only 1:32.  The film
is in German with easy to follow English subtitles.  It is rated PG-13
for a little violence, a single bad word, and no sex or nudity.  The
show would be fine for any kid old enough to be interested which I
guess would be around 9 or 10.  I liked the film, and if you like
bizarre little comedies that take risks, I think you may like it too.
I give the film ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
