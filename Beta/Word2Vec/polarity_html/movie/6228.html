<P>     Every movie has its own "making of" story, but, no matter how 
fascinating the account, it's unusual for the unexpurgated truth to 
emerge into the public realm.  1995's TWELVE MONKEYS is a rare 
exception.  Director Terry Gilliam, intrigued by the concept of having a 
record of the creative process (and wanting "witnesses" in case the 
studio attempted to renege on a deal and wrest away control), hand-
picked film makers Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe to fashion a behind-the-
scenes documentary.  The result, THE HAMSTER FACTOR AND OTHER TALES OF 
TWELVE MONKEYS, is a fascinating examination of what goes on when the 
cameras are turned off.  And, while THE HAMSTER FACTOR began as a look 
at the making of TWELVE MONKEYS, it quickly became a portrait of the 
creative genius behind the process:  ex-Monty Python member and maverick 
film maker, Gilliam.</P>
<P>     Perhaps the first question that leaps to mind is:  why call it THE 
HAMSTER FACTOR?  The story goes something like this:  There's a scene in 
TWELVE MONKEYS where a naked Bruce Willis is required to draw a sample 
of his own blood.  Off to the side, a caged hamster is supposed to be 
running in a wheel.  The take went as expected, except the hamster 
didn't do anything.  So there was a re-shoot, and the same thing 
happened.  Gilliam continued to re-film this sequence until the rodent 
did what it was supposed to.  In the director's own words, however, this 
is "a bit of detail that probably doesn't mean anything to anyone but 
myself."  Because this incident exemplifies Gilliam's obsessive approach 
to film making, THE HAMSTER FACTOR stuck.</P>
<P>     For TWELVE MONKEYS admirers and destractors alike, this represents 
an intriguing, intimate look at what went right and wrong on and around 
the set.  Even those who haven't seen Gilliam's movie will be intrigued 
by much of what transpires.  THE HAMSTER FACTOR has a different agenda 
than most "making of" movies -- this isn't intended as a glorified 
advertisement for TWELVE MONKEYS; it's more along the lines of Eleanor 
Coppola's HEARTS OF DARKNESS, which details the behind-the-scenes trials 
and tribulations of APOCALYPSE NOW.  This big difference between that 
film and this one, however, is that for THE HAMSTER FACTOR, Gilliam, 
producer Charles Roven, Bruce Willis, Madeleine Stowe, and Brad Pitt 
approved the finished version.  (Willis demanded that a two minute 
sequence, "Old Habits Die Hard", be removed from the final cut.  In it, 
Gilliam made some uncomplimentary comments about his leading man's 
acting style.)</P>
<P>     Undeniably, the most interesting aspect of THE HAMSTER FACTOR is 
watching Gilliam's creative crisis.  From the beginning, he's worried 
about coming to a project where he's a "director for hire" (in other 
words, he didn't have a hand in writing the movie).  Willis at times 
proves to be a headache (contrast his "hands-on" approach with the 
quiet, introverted style of Madeleine Stowe), and the $29 million budget 
restricts the film maker's vision.  As filming progresses, he becomes 
obsessed by visual imagery and details -- so much so that midway 
through, he confesses that he has "lost the film totally".  He worries 
about whether he's selling out -- whether TWELVE MONKEYS is his slip 
into "the abyss of the [Hollywood] system" or whether he's making "a 
European art film" for a major studio.  At one point, Gilliam becomes so 
exasperated that he threatens to quit.  He rants about how "fear seems 
to permeate Hollywood film making", and tries to inventive extravagant, 
expensive ways to escape shooting a scene that his producer wants, but 
he doesn't (and that he later admits to liking).  </P>
<P>     THE HAMSTER FACTOR is so absorbed with Gilliam that it doesn't 
spend much time on technical behind-the-scenes details.  There is some -
- the editing process is described, for example -- but, most of the 
traditional "making of" documentary elements are missing.  Another thing 
that comes across is that, while Willis occasionally clashes with 
Gilliam, the actor's passion is obvious, and it wouldn't be a surprise 
to see him behind the cameras soon.</P>
<P>     THE HAMSTER FACTOR, which distilled 135 hours of footage into a 90-
minute movie, follows TWELVE MONKEYS all the way to its release.  For 
Gilliam and Universal Pictures (reunited here after their public war 
over BRAZIL), there is a happy ending.  TWELVE MONKEYS set a first-
weekend-of-the-year box office record, became a success in every country 
where it opened, and, to date, has grossed $160 million (world-wide).  
Given Gilliam's occasional bouts of depression and disgust for his 
craft, it will be interesting to see what his next project will be, if 
there is one.</P>
<P>     Currently, there are no plans to release THE HAMSTER FACTOR 
theatrically.  The documentary will play the film festival circuit 
(officially premiering at this year's London Film Festival on November 
14), then appear on a laser disc special edition of TWELVE MONKEYS.  In 
Europe, it will receive a similar treatment, being appended to the 
laserdiscs and home videos of its parent film, or receiving a television 
broadcast.  So, while THE HAMSTER FACTOR will not be showing at the 
local multiplex, it's not destined for obscurity, and, when it becomes 
available, it's worth seeking out.</P>
