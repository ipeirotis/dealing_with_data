<P>     Every year around Christmas, there are two stories guaranteed to 
show up somewhere, sometime on television:  A CHRISTMAS CAROL (of which 
there are several good versions) and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (of which 
there is only one).  After its copyright was inexplicably not renewed in 
1974 and the film tumbled into the public domain, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE 
could be found on the air literally dozens of times every holiday 
season, with versions as varied as crisp, black-and-white prints to 
murky, colorized bastardizations.  Only recently (1994, to be exact), 
when NBC obtained exclusive rights to the film, has the Christmastime 
tide of broadcasts been stemmed.</P>
<P>     There's no doubt that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is one of today's most 
popular Christmas films, easily surpassing other favorites such as A 
MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET and the aforementioned A CHRISTMAS CAROL/SCROOGE.  
Of the many myths surrounding Frank Capra's 1946 film, the most often 
repeated one involves the movie's initial reception.  Contrary to common 
belief, it was not an immediate hit.  Nor was it a complete critical and 
popular failure.  Back in 1946-47, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE received mixed 
reviews, ranging from a lionization in THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER to a 
vicious trashing in the NEW YORKER.  Although nominated for five Academy 
Awards (including Best Picture and Best Actor, in what Stewart called 
his favorite role), the movie was shut out at the ceremony.  And, 
despite Capra's popularity at the box office, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE 
barely made back its cost.</P>
<P>     In fact, it was the expiration of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE's copyright 
that transformed it into a Christmas staple.  Once the film began 
showing with such frequency during the month of December, a whole new 
generation of movie-lovers discovered (and fell in love with) the 
previously-obscure release.  Critics of the '70s and '80s took a look at 
the movie, and the reviews were almost unanimously positive (one notable 
exception being that of Pauline Kael, who called it "doggerel" and 
"patronizing").  IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE achieved its deserved 
recognition, albeit four decades after it was first released.</P>
<P>     What is it about this film, an uplifting, sentimental fable about 
the importance of the individual, that strikes a responsive chord with 
so many viewers?  Some might argue that it has something to do with the 
season, but I don't buy that reasoning.  IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is just 
as good in July as in December -- the time of the year has little to do 
with motion picture quality.  Rather, I think IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has 
earned its legion of followers because it effectively touches upon one 
basic truth of life that we all would like to believe -- that each of 
us, no matter how apparently insignificant, has the power to make a 
difference, and that the measure of our humanity has nothing to do with 
fame or money, but with how we live our life on a day-to-day basis.  
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE asks and answers a question that all of us think 
of at one time or another:  "What would this world be like if I had 
never been born?"</P>
<P>     There's no doubt that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a "feel good" movie.  
In fact, at the time of its initial release, it was dubbed "Capra-corn."  
Yet the film's manipulation is intensely skillful and sincere in a way 
that is rarely apparent in any recently-released, "uplifting" title.  In 
today's cynical climate, I doubt that a picture like this could be made.  
The last Capra-esque fantasy to reach screens was the Nicolas 
Cage/Bridget Fonda romance, IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU, and that sunk like a 
rock at the box office.  Despite being brought to life during the '40s, 
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE offers a timeless story with a universal message.</P>
<P>     As almost every avid movie-lover knows, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE tales 
the story of George Bailey (Stewart), the unsung, beloved hero of 
Bedford Falls.  As a child, George was selfless, risking his own life 
(and losing his hearing in one ear) to save his brother from drowning.  
As an adult, he gave up his dreams of traveling the world and going to 
college to stay home and manage the Bailey Building and Loan Society 
after his father passed away.  Throughout his life, George lived by a 
creed that always placed human need above riches, and, as a result, his 
only wealth was in his friends and family.</P>
<P>     The film's villain is a miserly old man named Potter (played with 
consummate nastiness by movie great Lionel Barrymore), who uses his 
considerable wealth to bleed the citizens of Bedford Falls dry.  The 
Bailey Building and Loan Society is the only institution in town that he 
doesn't own, and he's willing to do anything to get his hands on it – 
lie, cheat, bribe, steal…  There's no end to the schemes that Potter 
devises to destroy George.  Yet the Baileys always seem to end up on 
top.</P>
<P>     The first two-thirds of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE recaps George's life 
during the span of years from 1919, when he's a child dreaming of 
becoming an explorer, until 1946, when he is firmly established as the 
rock of Bedford Falls.  The film has romance (George's courting of Mary, 
who is played by Donna Reed), comedy (an unexpected swim at a high 
school dance), and tragedy (the death of Peter Bailey).  And, although 
the predominant tone is upbeat, Capra effectively captures the darkness 
of George's mood as his mounting personal and financial troubles plunge 
him into an abyss of despair.  Those who mistakenly think of IT'S A 
WONDERFUL LIFE as all light and sunshine forget the grimness of certain 
later scenes, especially those that culminate in George standing on a 
bridge, contemplating suicide.</P>
<P>     Enter Clarence (Henry Travers), George's lovable, bumbling guardian 
angel, who has come to Bedford Falls to prove to George that his life is 
worth living.  To defend his position, he grants George one wish:  to 
see what the world would be like if he had never been born.  As he and 
George travel through the nightmarish alternate reality, they observe 
how much worse off many people would be.  Mary is a lonely spinster; 
George's brother, Harry, is dead; George's uncle, Billy, is in an insane 
asylum; and Potter owns the entire town.</P>
<P>     It's this often-copied segment of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE that 
reminds us of the film's kinship with Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  In 
both stories, the visions supplied by supernatural beings convince their 
subjects of the value of life and the importance of the contribution of 
the individual.  Despite the apparent difference in the nature of each 
story's protagonist, both popular Christmas tales strike similar chords 
with audiences.  Watching IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is truly an enriching 
experience.</P>
<P>     Capra not only had a knack for superior storytelling; he was a 
master of casting.  From the beginning, he always envisioned Jimmy 
Stewart as George.  Although the role had originally been developed 
under another producer for Cary Grant, when Capra took control of the 
project, he began rewrites with Stewart in mind.  It would be both mens' 
return to the screen following war service.  And, although Capra never 
regained the popularity he had attained during the '30s, Stewart became 
more in demand than ever.  His ability to show a darker side of himself 
– something he did for the first time in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE – led to 
him being accepted in roles that demanded an element of moral ambiguity, 
such as that of L.B. Jefferies in Alfred Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW.  To 
his dying day, Stewart would be known as an icon of small-town American 
values, but it's worth noting that the actor was capable of expanding 
beyond that stereotype.</P>
<P>     Even though Donna Reed was not Capra's first choice for Mary (Jean 
Arthur, who co-starred with Stewart in two of the director's previous 
efforts, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON and YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU, 
was otherwise committed), it's hard to imagine anyone else in this role.  
Reed embodies the independence and sweetness needed to capture George's 
heart.  And who can forget the romantic electricity in George and Mary's 
first kiss, while Sam Wainwright waits on the other end of the phone 
line?</P>
<P>     The supporting cast is both excellent and memorable.  Lionel 
Barrymore's Potter makes Scrooge seem like a genial gentleman.  Thomas 
Mitchell plays Uncle Billy, George's lovable-but-incompetent partner in 
the Bailey Building and Loan Society.  Henry Travers is Clarence, the 
second-class angel trying to earn his wings.  Frank Faylen and Ward Bond 
are Ernie the taxi driver and Bert the cop, respectively (the SESAME 
STREET duo of Bert and Ernie got their names from these two).  And 
Gloria Grahame is Violet, Bedford Falls' "bad girl", who has a soft spot 
for George.</P>
<P>     Technically, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is impressive.  A huge, 300-yard 
long representation of Bedford Falls' main street was constructed, with 
over 80 stores and buildings, and 20 transplanted oak trees.  Since the 
film was shot in the middle of summer, the copious amounts of snow used 
during the winter scenes had to be man-made (3000 tons of shaved ice, 
300 tons of gypsum, 300 tons of plaster, and 6000 gallons of chemicals 
were utilized).  Through the unique magic of motion pictures, it's 
impossible to tell that not one flake of snow is genuine.</P>
<P>     Combine the characters, the story, the message, and the acting, and 
it's easy to see why IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE isn't just a holiday 
favorite, but a great movie by almost any standards.  There are a few 
cynics who will disparage this film, but, in a "feel good" genre clogged 
with imitators and inferior features, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE stands high 
above the rest.  Whether you view this film in the middle of the summer 
or at Christmas, Capra's greatest film represents one of the most 
transcendent and joyful experiences any movie-lover can hope for.</P>
