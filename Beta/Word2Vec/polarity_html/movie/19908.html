<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>There was no visible difference between the characterization of a sleek
photography magazine, Frame, that is the subject of the film, and the
film itself, with all its glib characters provoking an air of chic
fashion, all in the pretense of art. What makes this film mesmerizing,
is not the plot, but the virtuoso performance of Lucy Berliner (Ally
Sheedy), as a wily photographer, retired from her professional duties
for the last ten years and living in a lesbian relationship with a
has-been German actress, Greta (Clarkson). Lucy is able to find things
within herself to show her jaded mood and her deeper artistic yearnings
for something that is unattainable. It is a performance that makes the
film seem greater than how it really is.</P>
<P>The less interesting story line involves the ambitions of an attractive,
baby-faced assistant editor at the magazine, Syd (Radha Mitchell), who
lives with a boyfriend (Mann) in an emotionally chilling relationship. A
plumbing problem brings her upstairs and that is the ploy used to show
how she meets the once famous photographer and her tired lover, who once
worked with the German director Fassbinder as an actress before her
demise through a heroin addiction. A sexual attraction develops between
the photographer and her ambitious neighbor. The complications that
arise out of this new relationship is the springboard for the plot.</P>
<P>Lisa Cholodenko's first feature is a sleek and soulful look at the
relationship between the two women, who find that they are attracted to
each other for various reasons, and it is also a look at the breaking up
of another relationship that was once vibrant but is now deadened by the
overuse of heroin and of a lingering ennui and self-pity that has set
in. The ambitious Syd is taken in by Lucy's artistic skills and worldly
manner, while Lucy is attracted to the beauty and youthful energy Syd
has, and is not displeased with her ambitions. That Syd should change
all her values on this chance encounter is possible but highly unlikely,
but in the milieu of these urban hipsters, their relationship works out
well. The two of them seem to have a chemistry together and their
kissing scenes did give us a needed look into their passions, with the
more controlling Lucy being in charge of things and instigating the
relationship to be more sexual.</P>
<P>Patricia Clarkson contributed a sense of despair and a cagey ability for
survival, as she reeks of being a sophisticated world travel. She is the
jealous lover who senses her impending doom, who is hateful of this
sycophantic upstart who has just entered her life. She has most of the
lines in the film that pack a wallop. When introduced to Syd, she says
in her heroin induced high state, which is where the film probably or
should have derived its title of High Art from: "I live for Lucy- I
mean, I live here with Lucy." The combo of the three women with
different intentions and personalities, plays well, as the acting here
is really fine. All the actors were properly ensconced in their roles
and supported each other very well.</P>
<P>The look inside Syd's new power job (shown kow-towing to those above
her, while putting on airs to those below her), where she was just
promoted from being an intern, is a despairing look at the work scene
she so much is enamored by; of her editor (Thornton), who is filled with
cynicism and arrogance, and the boss of the place Dominique (Anh), whose
opinion counts the most, as she is the one making the big decisions for
the magazine. For Syd, to bring back Lucy to work and have her work be
featured on the cover of the magazine, is her coup. It gives the story
some tension as to how Lucy will be reconciled to this commercial
venture, when she gave all this up because it was impossible for her to
continue working at a straight job, and she just stopped showing up and
dropped out of sight, though still taking portrait photos on her own.</P>
<P>Eventually the film, after being carried along by Sheedy's intense
performance, dies an ungraceful death from too much of its slickness; it
ran out of things to resolve other than by means of contrivance, and it
was highly questionable that the "art" seen was really worthy of being
deemed as something special. We just lost interest in the characters,
the film began to look like a commercial for a magazine that wouldn't
stop and get to the main article.</P>
<P>So what could have been cutting edge dramatics, if the lesbian romance
was followed through further, turns out to be a film not about art, but
more of a soap opera story, about how three women, at different stages
of their life, get together and separate. All the pain that is there, is
finally settled in the usual way sitcoms settle problems they don't want
to handle any more. Which left the film only somewhat satisfying; it did
create a proper atmosphere for us to view these lost characters, and it
did have something to say about how their lives are being emotionally
torn apart. But we only get a voyeurs look at them, and that is not
enough of a look for us to say that we penetrated into their world of
mind-games and drug induced delusions and need for each other. The film
just looked too much like the slick magazine it presented in the film;
that it wanted to say something more about Syd's sudden sexual reversal
and about the despair in Lucy's life, but it just couldn't get it out
what it wanted to say, which is why the film became a let down. Its
style was, perhaps, too beautiful for its own good. It would have been
wiser to develop more depth for the main characters and show them to be
more than the superficial beings they seemed to be on screen. Being a
talented photographer is not necessarily being a fully developed person,
as evidenced by Lucy's dissolute lifestyle and poor decision making.</P>
