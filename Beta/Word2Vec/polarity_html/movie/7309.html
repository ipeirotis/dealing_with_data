<P>     WARRIORS OF VIRTUE is a great title.  Unfortunately, it's not a 
great movie.  The film, a family-oriented fantasy-adventure, is an 
amalgamation of Asian mysticism, cartoon violence, J.R.R. Tolkien, STAR 
WARS, and THE WIZARD OF OZ.  For originality, coherence, and 
intelligence, it's on par with STARGATE and INDEPENDENCE DAY.  For 
entertainment, it's a notch below.</P>
<P>     The film opens with an ominous, disembodied voice declaring, "I 
remember a world with no wars, no warriors.  But now all that has 
changed."  It seems that the evil warlord Komodo (Angus Macfadyen) has 
been systematically destroying the energy source of the mythical world 
of Tao in order to prolong his life.  Now, in the planet's most dire 
hour, Komodo is preparing his armies to march against the surviving 
population.  The situation looks bleak until the arrival of "The 
Newcomer", a.k.a. Ryan Jeffers (Mario Yedidia), an ordinary Earth teen 
who is transported to Tao when he accidentally drowns.  Ryan brings with 
him the fabled "Manuscript of Legend," a book that tells how to defeat 
the dark forces arrayed against Tao.  Unfortunately, Komodo's minions 
steal it from Ryan before he can present it to Tao's quintet of 
defenders, the kangaroo-like "Warriors of Virtue", and their teacher, 
Master Chung (Chao-Li Chi).</P>
<P>     The basic story is a variation on the age-old struggle between good 
and evil, although, in WARRIORS OF VIRTUE, it's heavily leavened with 
mystical and anti-violence messages.  The latter seem rather 
hypocritical, for, although the film hammers home the moral that killing 
is evil, it doesn't have a problem with the concept of applying a 
vicious beating to a foe.  The kung fu battle sequences, while 
choreographed with flair, are often brutal, and the lack of blood only 
makes them seem more sanitized.  </P>
<P>     WARRIORS OF VIRTUE is a little to juvenile to be enjoyable for 
anyone past puberty.  The film, with its shallow symbols (such as a 
cocoon in a jar) and sermonizing, displays little thematic or character 
depth.  The plot is perfunctory and obvious, and the special effects 
used to animate the five partially-animatronic warriors are barely 
adequate.  The set design is impressive, but that doesn't mean much 
amidst all the other woes.  For good measure, a healthy dose of pop 
Chinese mysticism is injected into the script.  This has the unfortunate 
effect of making WARRIORS OF VIRTUE seem like a STAR WARS rip-off, with 
Master Chung taking the Obi-Wan Kenobi role -- teaching his young 
charge, dying in a battle-to-the-death with the Dark Lord, then 
returning as a spirit to give invaluable advice.  </P>
<P>     The movie's most interesting character, a girl named Alyssia 
(Marley Shelton), is criminally underused.  Alyssia is torn between good 
and evil, trapped between the desire to do right and Komodo's seductive 
allure.  She's the only one in the film that we develop any real 
interest in, and the script, apparently unable to deal with a 
personality having the potential to display more than one dimension, 
discards her perfunctorily and inelegantly.  </P>
<P>     The acting in WARRIORS OF VIRTUE can be counted among its most 
serious flaws.  Director Ronnie Yu (THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR), one of 
many Hong Kong film makers migrating to the West, has an excellent 
visual sense, but, at least in this case, he is incapable of culling 
solid performances out of his cast members.  The young lead, Mario 
Yedidia (JACK), is teeth-grindingly awful, displaying a complete 
inability to convey any emotion subtly.  Yedidia's "performance" makes 
you appreciate the quality evident in the work of his many superior 
peers.  Angus Macfadyen (Robert the Bruce in BRAVEHEART) is distinctly 
unimpressive, with a generic, over-the-top style that's more laughable 
than effective.  There's nothing remotely sinister about Komodo -- he 
looks like a rock star in need of a good night's sleep.  Marley Shelton 
and Chao-Li Chi are merely adequate in supporting parts.  I suppose the 
five actors trapped beneath the Warrior costumes deserve some kind of 
recognition for what they endured to lend their creature-characters a 
semblance of life.</P>
<P>     Fantasy films have an extremely poor motion picture history, 
perhaps because it's so difficult for a movie to capture the kind of 
pure magic that exists only in the imagination.  WARRIORS OF VIRTUE is 
an abysmal entry to the genre, and boasts very little to offer any 
audience, young or old.  The film makers probably thought they were 
creating a sort of WIZARD OF OZ for today's generation.  What they ended 
up with is a lot closer to ADULT MUTANT NINJA KANGAROOS.  </P>
