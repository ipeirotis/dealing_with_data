<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An edgy George Loomis (Cotten) can't sleep and wanders aimlessly along
the banks of Niagara Falls on the Canadian side of the border and
returns to his motel cabin, where he observes his much younger and very
sexy wife Rose (Monroe) as she sleeps.</P>
<P>A young couple, on their belated honeymoon, just arrive from the Midwest
to stay in the same motel cabin as the Loomis'. Polly (Peters) and Ray
Cutler (Adams) are a satisfied couple, excited to be tourists and eager
to enjoy the falls. He works for a cereal company in Ohio whose main
factory is on the New York side of the falls, and he just won this
vacation for a catchy advertising slogan he submitted, as he also hopes
to meet the big boss of the cereal plant Mr. Kettering (Wilson) and try
to advance his career. The couple is ready to move into their reserved
cabin that overlooks the falls but the Loomis' haven't vacated, as Rose
complains that she can't move her sick husband at present because he's
sleeping, something he rarely does. She also mentions that her husband
was just released from a veterans mental hospital. Mr. Qua (Collins),
the motel owner, reluctantly gets the couple another cabin, as Polly
doesn't want to disturb someone who's sick.</P>
<P>While the Cutlers are touring the falls, Polly spots Rose smooching with
her lover (Allan).
Later on, at the motel, Rose joins some young dancers at the motel and
asks them to play a record called "Kiss." She's overdressed or
underdressed, depending on how you look at things, as she wears a sultry
red, low-cut dress, which prompts Ray to say, "Hey, get out the fire
hose." Upon hearing that song, George, in front of the dancers, breaks
the record in a fit of anger and cuts his hand. Polly patches up the cut
and George tells her how he met his saloon waitress wife and how she's a
tramp and that since he married her his life has gone downhill due to
his instability and his concern about her unfaithfulness, but he loves
her so much that he can't leave her.</P>
<P>Rose's diabolical plan is to have her boyfriend kill her distraught
husband and dump his body over the falls to make it look like a suicide.
But things backfire when the boyfriend comes after George with a wrench
but is overcome by him. The action takes place offscreen. George leaves
the sightseeing area by taking the boyfriend's clothes, hoping that he
will be taken for dead and he therefore can freely go after his wife.</P>
<P>When Inspector Sharkey (O'Dea) asks Rose to identify if the body found
by the falls is her husband's, she faints. A little later, Polly spots
George in her room thinking his wife is there, but Polly can't convince
her husband that she wasn't having a nightmare, that she really saw
George. She will later call the police even though she's sympathetic to
him, but she's afraid he will kill his wife.</P>
<P>Some viwers might consider Niagara more of a steamy melodrama than a
noir, but it does have all the dark ingredients fitting a noir film,
whereby an innocent is overtaken by a lust that consumes him, while the
femme fatale is a heartless schemer with a large sexual appetite. This
was Marilyn Monroe's first starring role, after having been in already
eighteen other films, but mostly in small roles.</P>
<P>The real star in this film is the majestic and powerful Niagara Falls
and the costar is the bell tower, where musical requests by the visitors
are honored. The falls symbolizes that the sexual conflict of the
Loomis' is getting out of control and leading to their destruction.
Director Hathaway does a nice job of crafting the film and exploiting
its colorful location, but what he doesn't do that well, is allow the
mystery part of the story to gracefully unfold. The last reel plays like
an action film, with a strangulation, a kidnapping, a helicopter rescue,
and one character doomed to be going over the falls.</P>
<P>In contrast to the Loomis', the Cutler's are seen as being a
conventional couple, and the camera seems to be gently eyeballing them
and showing that their sex life is calmer and more suited for a positive
and loving relationship than the Loomis'. Yet the normal couple is
attracted to the more exotic one, especially Polly, through whose eyes
the film is filtered out to us.</P>
