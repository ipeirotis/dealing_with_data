<PRE>BOOTY CALL</PRE>
<PRE>A Film Review by Brian Takeshita</PRE>
<PRE>Rating:  *1/2 out of ****</PRE>
<P>I know there were times during this movie that I laughed pretty hard.
The problem is, I can't remember them as I write this review.  That's
not a good sign.</P>
<P>In BOOTY CALL, Jamie Foxx is Bunz, a character whom I can't really
describe, because I don't know that much about him.  I only know that
he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk, and that he doesn't like
relationships, just "booty calls" at three in the morning (no
questions, no commitment).  Bunz has a best friend named Rushon (Tommy
Davidson), who seems to be Bunz's direct opposite:  On the straight
and narrow, and currently in a long-term commitment (a whole seven
weeks, wow!).  Rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend,
Nikki (Tamala Jones), but for a reason which is not totally explained,
it's going to happen after a double date with Bunz and Nikki's friend
Lysterine (Vivica A. Fox), who have never met.  To make a long story
short, the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening
having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by Nikki's obsession with
safe sex.  First she wants condoms, so Bunz and Rushon go out and get
them.  Oh, no, they have to be latex, not lambskin.  Back to the
store.  Now they've got to get dental dams, or there'll be no
foreplay.  Why are both couples stopped each time Nikki makes a
demand?  Nikki phones Lysterine, who lives across the hall, and tells
her she'd better be making these demands, too.  Talk about coitus
interruptus.</P>
<P>BOOTY CALL is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a
regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies.  The difference
between the two is that in the latter, things constantly happen which
are so far removed from reality.  In this category, for example, you
have ACE VENTURA: PRIVATE EYE on the mild side, and AIRPLANE! at the
extreme.  There are times during BOOTY CALL where the film steps out
of its shell and tries for this status, but then too often quickly
retreats to the safety of convention.  It is disappointing, and even
worse, distracting.</P>
<P>There are also instances where the screenplay by Takashi Bufford and
Bootsie Parker (are those real names?) does not live up to its
potential, as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad
writing.  For instance, there is a scene where our main characters are
in a Chinese restaurant.  Bunz goes up to an Asian gangster and speaks
to him in fluent Cantonese, much to everyone's surprise.  However,
when asked how he learned the language, he goes into this explanation
of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films, and
soon gained mastery.  This negated the ludicrousness of the entire
scene.  If, on the other hand, when asked how he learned to speak
Chinese, Bunz simply replied with, "kung-fu movies," and then moved
on, the joke would have been much more effective.  This is because it
would have been totally unbelievable, but funny because we know it is
unbelievable.  By explaining the point and trying to make the
ridiculous plausible, the film is not giving its viewers enough
credit.</P>
<P>The inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise
other questions.  Why are two such disparate people like Bunz and
Rushon best friends?  Why do Rushon and Nikki fix up Bunz and
Lysterine?  If Nikki is so obsessed with safe sex, why doesn't she
have some condoms at her own apartment?  These questions are not
answered by the screenplay, but are overlooked for the sole reason of
moving the plot forward.</P>
<P>A very noticeable quality of BOOTY CALL is the prevalence of
unnecessary foul language.  Some movies use a lot of swear words, but
use them under very justifiable circumstances, as when they are
employed consistent with a character's pattern of speech.  Other
films, such as the recent JACKIE BROWN, use them in ways that almost
parody themselves.  BOOTY CALL just sticks them in to get laughs, and
it doesn't work.  They stick out like sore thumbs because there is
almost no reason to use them.</P>
<P>Half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason.  The Chinese
restaurant, a holdup at a convenience store, and a trip to the
hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story, and are in there
for filler.  This is surprising, considering that the film is less
than eighty minutes long.  It's too bad that the core of the film
isn't much better, since it is comprised of sometimes funny, but
forgettable dialog.  I refer you to the first paragraph of this
review.</P>
