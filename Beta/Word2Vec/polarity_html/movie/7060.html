<P>     The sum total of my direct familiarity with Howard Stern, including
the 110 minutes of PRIVATE PARTS, now stands at about 114 minutes.
Before seeing the film I had not read his book, had never heard his radio
program, and seen him only in passing as a guest on T.V. talk shows or on
his own E! Entertainment Television program.  I knew Stern only
indirectly, as a much-reviled icon of all things excessive and an object
of adoration for devoted fan base, but I did not know enough about him to
have a real opinion.  I suspect that mine was the best possible point of
entry for PRIVATE PARTS, because I was expecting neither to hate it nor to
revel in vulgarity.  Without the burden of preconceptions, I was free to
laugh myself silly at a completely unexpected delight.  It's hard to say
who may be more surprised at PRIVATE PARTS -- Stern's fans or his
detractors -- because it is funny in almost every possible way:  at times
goofy and low key, at times undeniably outrageous.</P>
<P>     Based on Stern's best-selling 1993 autobiography, PRIVATE PARTS stars
Stern as himself in the story of his own life.  Beginning with Stern's
childhood in New York, the film traces his interest in radio from an
early age to his study of communication at Boston University.  There Stern
meets Alison (Mary McCormack), the woman of his dreams who becomes his
wife and devoted supporter.  That support is necessary through tough early
deejay jobs in upstate New York, Hartford and Detroit, where Stern
develops a conventional on-air persona.  It isn't until he gets a plum job
in Washington D.C. that Stern invents his more shocking style, and
becomes an instant ratings sensation.  That success wins him a spot at New
York's WNBC, but the management, including program director Kenny Rushton
(Paul Giamatti), is determined to rein in the often-offensive Howard.</P>
<P>     The savvy edge of PRIVATE PARTS really should not have been a
surprise considering Betty Thomas was in the director's chair.  Thomas
previously did sharp work with THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE and HBO's talk show
wars docu-comedy THE LATE SHIFT, proving herself adept with the worlds of
media and pop culture, and she manages to put a surprising amount of
energy into scenes of people sitting around talking into microphones.
Some of those scenes are simply brilliant, including the attempt by a
flustered Kenny (a wonderfully slimy performance by Paul Giamatti) to stop
Stern's broadcast of an off-color parody of "Match Game."  Thomas' most
impressive achievement, however, may be taking a group of radio
personalities -- including Stern's cohorts Robin Quivers and Fred Norris
-- and putting them in situations where they could be comfortable.  Norris
in particular has some hilarious moments, notably in a sequence in a
B-movie actress's hotel room where he steals every scene hardly saying a
word.</P>
<P>     Then there is Stern himself, who proves, if nothing else, that he is
an extraordinarily canny manipulator of his own image.  For those who
think of him as an evil lecher, PRIVATE PARTS offers a portrait of Stern
as a devoted family man whose reverence for his wife borders on idolatry;
for those who think of him as the self-aggrandizing, self-proclaimed "King
of All Media," PRIVATE PARTS offers the humbling vision of Howard the
adolescent geek, strolling through the '70s with a Mike Brady perm and a
cheesy moustache.  Most notably, PRIVATE PARTS offers those who consider
Stern's routines mean-spirited the chance to watch him as he performs,
grinning at his own naughtiness like a gangly Benny Hill.  It may not be a
tremendous challenge to make an acting debut playing yourself, but Stern
makes the character he plays something you might never expect:  charming.</P>
<P>     Is the Howard Stern of PRIVATE PARTS the _real_ Howard Stern?
Probably not.  There's certainly a contradiction between Stern's
announcement to Alison prior to the emergence of the now-recognizable
Stern persona that he's going to "be myself," and the disingenuous
suggestion that he's just playing a character on the air; the truth
probably exists somewhere in the middle.  It does grow a bit tiresome
hearing Howard bemoan how misunderstood he is, and the film slows down
considerably whenever he feels obliged once again to show us his sensitive
side.  PRIVATE PARTS is much funnier when Stern laughs at himself, or when
he does the things that make other people laugh at him.  Still, it's no
easy trick to please Stern's fans while placating his enemies, and PRIVATE
PARTS serves up raunchiness and bad taste in a slick and snappy package.
No matter how much of Howard Stern you've seen, this is a Howard Stern you
haven't seen.</P>
