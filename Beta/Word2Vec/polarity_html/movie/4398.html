<P>     These days, Hollywood seems to be almost entirely bankrupt of new 
ideas.  For bursts of inspiration or innovation, the movie-goer 
increasingly has to seek out independent motion pictures.  What we are 
getting more and more from the big studios is a flood of sequels, films 
based on novels, films based on TV series, remakes, or a combination of 
the above.  SABRINA joins this list as the latest classic whose script 
and cast have been updated for the '90s -- although in the case of this 
variation on the CINDERELLA tale, the story admittedly has a certain 
timeless quality.</P>
<P>     In general, I approach romances with a great deal of skepticism, 
principally because it's so easy to mess up this kind of movie.  Love is 
a difficult emotion to effectively capture on film, and, too often, 
screen romances look like two actors going through the motions.  
Happily, with SABRINA, that's not the case.  Despite the unambitious, 
formula-driven plot, wonderful performances by Julia Ormond and, 
especially, Harrison Ford keep this remake afloat.</P>
<P>     I would never claim that SABRINA is one of 1995's best romantic 
movies (although it is an improvement on the overrated THE AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT).  Its plot-by-numbers story doesn't offer much in the way of 
surprises, and it doesn't have the emotional power of a LEAVING LAS 
VEGAS or the euphoric quality of THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN.  But SABRINA is 
fun in its own way, and, though clearly flawed, it nevertheless offers 
two hours' solid diversion (the overlong running time, by the way, is 
one of those flaws).</P>
<P>     The title character, Sabrina Fairchild (Ormond), is the daughter of 
the Larrabee family's chauffeur (John Wood).  Since she was little, 
Sabrina has had a crush on the youngest Larrabee son, David (Greg 
Kinnear), a dashing playboy.  Unfortunately for her, David doesn't 
really know she exists.  So, when Sabrina goes off to Paris to change 
her life (and appearance), she still harbors her passion in secret.  
When, after "finding herself" abroad, she returns home and dazzles David 
with her new glamour and self-possession, she sees a chance for her 
dreams to become real.  But complications arise -- David is engaged to a 
wealthy pediatrician (Lauren Holly), and the marriage will seal a major 
merger between the Larrabee Corporation and Tyson Electronics.  David's 
older brother, Linus (Harrison Ford), the "living heart donor" head of 
the corporation, won't allow his brother's flirtation with Sabrina to 
endanger the deal, so, in the best interests of business, he makes a 
play for her.  Unfortunately, Linus gets in over his head and the cold, 
calculating businessman discovers that he does indeed have a heart.</P>
<P>     In 1954, Audrey Hepburn was Sabrina.  While Julia Ormond is no 
Hepburn, she possesses the kind of luminous screen presence which allows 
us to accept her part in this modern-day fairy tale.  Harrison Ford, 
taking over for Humphrey Bogart, is very good as Linus, carefully mixing 
pathos, cruelty, and compassion into a surprisingly complex personality.  
The weakest of the main performers is Greg Kinnear (in the William 
Holden part), who is more of a personality than an actor -- and, at 
times, this shows.  Of the supporting players, only veteran actor John 
Wood is worthy of special note.  The rest of the cast do adequate, but 
not noteworthy, jobs.</P>
<P>     In 1991's REGARDING HENRY, Harrison Ford's character was 
transformed from a heartless man to a loving husband by a bullet to the 
head.  Here, the personality change is similar, but it happens in a more 
believable fashion, and the motivator -- love -- seems far less 
contrived.  It's not really that difficult to defend SABRINA, despite 
its numerous faults.  Even though it isn't as good as the original 1954 
version, this movie, brought to the screen by director Sydney Pollack 
(OUT OF AFRICA), simply has too much romantic appeal and on-screen 
chemistry to be dismissed as "just another" in the ever-growing pool of 
remakes.</P>
