<P>         Even though it grossed about $400 million worldwide, has anyone
really been waiting anxiously for four years for a sequel to "Mission:
Impossible"? How many people do you know who really loved (much less
understood) that slick, cold and mostly forgettable movie?</P>
<P> Apparently Tom Cruise did, and when it comes to getting films
produced, you don't need much more of a supporter than him. Perhaps,
after spending most of the late 1990s exercising his acting muscles in
such weighty fare as "Eyes Wide Shut" and "Magnolia" he's been yearning
for the day when he can show up on the set, throw on a black leather
jacket, jump on a mototrcycle, ride like the wind and forget all about
digging deep within his psyche to find the right emotion. "Besides," he
might rationalize, "I didn't get the Oscar for 'Magnolia,' and my fans
complained there weren't any explosions in 'Eyes Wide Shut,' so why not
give the people what they want?"</P>
<P> If pyrotechnics and chases are all it takes to satisfy a summer
movie audience, no one can accuse "Mission: Impossible II" -- or "M:
I-2," as the press materials call it -- of shortchanging its viewers.
There's even a smattering of James Bond-style high-tech spy wizardry
thrown in, including a tracking device implanted in the body that can
send your position anywhere on earth to a satellite that zaps the
information back to a computer, and a variety of extraordinarily
realistic masks that can help heroes masquerade as villains and vice
versa.</P>
<P> Since "M: I-2" is directed by John Woo ("Face-Off," "The
Killer"), it also includes several grandiose gun battles, almost all of
which are slowed down to emphasize, Woo's followers will say, their
balletic qualities. To the masses, however, the movie's continual use
of  slow-motion will probably be unintentionally funny at first, then
just plain irritating. Unfortunately for Woo, American directors have
ripped off his moves so many times now (most notably in "The Matrix,"
which managed both to steal them and improve upon them) it seems as if
the old master is picking his own pocket.</P>
<P> Flawed as it is, "M: I-2" is still a major improvement over the
original "Mission," which Brian DePalma seemed to direct on auto-pilot.
For starters, it's got a clearly defined plot line; the original was so
unnecessarily complicated it would have taken flow charts and a slide
show to explain.</P>
<P> Robert Towne, who wrote both films, borrows heavily from Alfred
Hitchcock's 1946 masterpiece "Notorious," as Cruise's super-agent Ethan
Hunt must send the woman he loves -- in this case, an exotic-looking cat
burglar named Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) -- into the arms of
evil in order to get the information he needs to save the world. In
"Notorious," Cary Grant was trying to expose Nazis; here, Hunt has to
locate the lethal Chimera virus, which devours its victims from the
inside out in record time. So the dutiful Nyah beds down with her old
boyfriend Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), a wealthy, wicked entrepreneur
who'd like to infect all of Australia with Chimera, then put the cure on
the market at an inflated price. Supervillains these days don't want
ransom money -- they want stock options in bio-tech firms.</P>
<P> In contrast to most of today's crash-and-smash epics, which
can't go more than five minutes without dropping a one-liner, "M: I-2"
maintains a straight face, even when its characters are doing fairly
ridiculous things. When the funniest guy in the movie is Anthony Hopkins
(who shows up at the beginning and the end of the story as Hunt's boss),
you know you're watching a serious-minded film.</P>
<P> Disappointingly, "M: I-2" brings back Ving Rhames as Hunt's
former partner Luther Stickell, then keeps him on the bench, plopping
him in front of a computer screen or at the controls of a helicopter
instead of letting him in on the action. That territory is reserved for
Cruise and Cruise alone, and the star does a more than capable job of
handling his stunts, including a final knife fight that, while drawn-out
in the same way as Woo's overblown finale in "Face-Off," generates at
least one major shock that's sure to have everyone gasping
simultaneously.</P>
<P> Cruise comes up startlingly short, however, in his scenes with
Newton. Although the story is built around their romance, there's
nothing exciting going on between them, and even when Towne follows his
"Notorious" blueprint right down to the scene in which our heroine
poisons herself in the name of duty, Hunt seems only moderately
distressed. Poor Nyah would have gotten a much warmer reception from
Cary Grant. James Sanford</P>
