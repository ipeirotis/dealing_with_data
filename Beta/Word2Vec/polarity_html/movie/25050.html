<PRE>AMARCORD
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2000</PRE>
<P>According to Hollywood movies made in last few decades, life
in small town is one of the worst things that could happen
to a human being. Even worse fate awaits those who were
unfortunate to grow up in those dark, God-forsaken places
and later forced to live forever traumatised by the
experience. On the other hand, it seems that something more
than Atlantic Ocean divides Europe from America, because one
of the most popular and beloved European films takes exactly
the opposite view. This film is AMARCORD, 1974 comedy by
famous Italian director Federico Fellini, which later gave
inspiration to numerous imitations and homages, and even led
few American screen artists to adopt its heretical views
about benefits of small town life.</P>
<P>The film is based on the screenplay by Fellini and Tonino
Guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense. Instead we
follow one year in 1930s Italian summer resort town of
Rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict
various local events and customs, as well as series of
local, often very colourful characters. Although many of
those characters occasionally take the role of narrator,
movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist, 14-year old
boy Titta (played by Bruno Zanin) and chronicles his sexual
frustrations, obsession with local beauty queen named
Gradisca (played by Magali Noel), problems in his lovingly
dysfunctional family, as well as troubles his father (played
by Armando Brancia) have with Mussolini's fascist regime.</P>
<P>AMARCORD was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film, and
it probably explains why it is very popular, even among
those people who actually don't like Federico Fellini's work
very much. Every member of its potential audience would find
part of himself or herself in this film, because Fellini in
this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint
past in the best way possible. Distortion between actual
past and its subjective interpretation could be found even
in the title of the film - word "Amarcord" is nothing more
than badly pronounced phrase "I remember" in local Italian
dialect. In the same way the word is distorted, so is the
past in memories of those who remember it. After the
premiere, Fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical
character of this film, but it doesn't matter whether Rimini
of AMARCORD actually resembles Rimini of Fellini's childhood
or not; any place and any time could resemble characters and
situations of this film.</P>
<P>Fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a
way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film. Even the most
naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque
images. Characters look like caricatures, actors playing
them often deliberately overact, and women, especially those
who fuel Titta's sexual fantasies, often have certain body
parts with gargantuan proportions. Every now and then,
scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into
fantasies of movie's characters and Rimini becomes almost
indistinguishable from the magical place in characters'
visions. Because of that, almost everything in this film
looks different, and in most cases better, than it would
have looked in the real life. Even the Fascism gets
Fellinian make-over - Fellini views Mussolini's totalitarian
regime as nothing more than visual spectacle (explaining why
similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout
history) and opportunity for comedy. When Fascists finally
show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents,
even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour.</P>
<P>Unlike many of his Italian colleagues in 1970s, who had used
1930s period setting to explicitly condemn Fascism and serve
fashionable political agenda, Fellini doesn't care that much
about politics. Lack of self-righteous moral perspective is
compensated with Fellini's humanistic approach to his
characters. Each of them, regardless of age, gender, social
class or physical appearance, is given opportunity to
express his or her views, dreams and fears. Fellini treats
all those characters with warmth and affection, even when he
paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people. Because
of this warmth and democratic spirit, AMARCORD could be
viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th Century, and
it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting
having many uncomfortable, melancholic and even tragic
moments.</P>
<P>Fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own
directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this
movie. Vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters
only; Fellini uses camera, painting film in bright colours,
especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies.
Fellini also knows how to use locations, whether such
location happens to be luxurious hotel, bright-coloured
beach or rural countryside. Even the down-to-earth streets
of Rimini, where everyone knows everyone, gets magical
dimension during the snowfall. On the other hand, lack of
credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect
during the ocean liner scene. This atmosphere is also
provided by incredible talent of composer and Fellini's
long-time associate Nino Rota. His Amarcord theme is
probably one of the most recognisable, most popular and most
relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced.
That music alone should be the reason to view AMARCORD as
one of the indisputable classics of seventh art.</P>
