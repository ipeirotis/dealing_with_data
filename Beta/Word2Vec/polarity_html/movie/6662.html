<P>     Please ignore the next couple of sentences if you are a stickler
about having no part of a plot spoiled for you:  in MARVIN'S ROOM, nobody
dies.  Illness plays a significant role in the story, and many viewers
have come to resent maudlin disease-of-the-week melodramas in which
everything seems to function as an extended prologue to a tear-jerking
deathbed scene.  There is something terribly dehumanizing about making an
illness the central character in a narrative, so it is a relief to
discover that MARVIN'S ROOM is actually about people.  Though occasionally
stage-bound and over-plotted, MARVIN'S ROOM finds superb actors lending a
surprisingly restrained touch to a genre crying out for a little
restraint.</P>
<P>     Diane Keaton plays Bessie Wakefield, a never-married woman who has
spent most of her adult life caring for her bed-ridden father Marvin (Hume
Cronyn) and somewhat simple-minded Aunt Ruth (Gwen Verdon) in Florida.
After years of helping others, however, Bessie suddenly finds herself in
need of help when she is diagnosed with leukemia.  With a bone marrow
donation her best chance at survival, Bessie calls on the only other
immediate family she has:  Lee (Meryl Streep), the sister she has not seen
in nearly twenty years.  Though miles and profound differences have
separated them, Lee comes to Bessie with her two sons -- emotionally
troubled Hank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and bookish Charlie (Hal Scardino).  The
reunion is strained by a variety of conflicts, but gradually the family
members begin to realize the strength of the bonds that connect them, and
their need for each other.</P>
<P>     Writer Scott McPherson died of AIDS in 1992, and if you look
carefully at MARVIN'S ROOM you can see evidence of that specific disease
in many aspects of the story:  the personal relationships between the ill
and their care-takers; the care-takers themselves becoming ill; the
tension of familial disapproval.  Fortunately, MARVIN'S ROOM isn't _about_
AIDS any more than it is _about_ any disease.  It is about estrangement
and reconciliation and family ties, and it covers this treacherous ground
with as much comedy as sadness.  There are some wonderful black-humored
moments, including Aunt Ruth's pain-blocking device which also acts as a
garage door opener and an absent-minded doctor (Robert DeNiro) who uses
tourniquets as pants clips while riding his bicycle.  Stage veteran Jerry
Zaks does fine work with his rookie screen effort, and the gifted
cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski (Krzysztof Kieslowski's RED) gives
MARVIN'S ROOM a warm, comforting glow.  The overall effect of the film is
an unusual one for films of its kind:  it draws you in without pouncing on
you with over-wrought emotions.</P>
<P>     The superb cast certainly deserves much of the credit for that
success.  Diane Keaton, who has been re-born with two great screen
showcases in 1996 (this one and THE FIRST WIVES CLUB), radiates a basic
decency as Bessie, but she is not painted in saintly tones.  Bessie is not
bitter at the hand life has dealt her; she is simply resentful that Lee
left her to play it alone.  She has a couple of fine moments with Leonardo
DiCaprio, who plays a stock "troubled youth" role skillfully and without
histrionics, as the two lonely souls find sympathy in one another.  And of
course there is Meryl Streep, an actress so talented it has become a sort
of cinematic sport to mock her versatility.  Here she plays Lee with an
anger which drives her every action (though she does indulge in that
well-work actor's crutch of acting with her cigarette on occasion), and
she is convincing both in her early resistance to any overtures of good
will and in her slow realization that she cares more about her sister than
she realized.  There is a particular grace to her honest portrayal of
someone terribly uncomfortable with being around illness.  In one
perfectly pitched scene, she recoils at the sheer number of emergency
numbers needed to care for her father, then slowly steels herself to
helping with his medication because she knows at that moment that she is
needed.  The conflict between Bessie and Lee is presented with an ironic
realization that each sister thinks the other one has gotten the better
life, and both Keaton and Streep make the tearing down of that wall a
moving experience.</P>
<P>     There are certainly times when MARVIN'S ROOM feels hemmed in by its
stage roots, and conversations build to an over-dramatized pitch.
McPherson's script also over plays its comic relief card, particularly in
the person of Dan Hedaya as a lithium-medicated receptionist who seems
more appropriate to an episode of "Murphy Brown."  DiCaprio's character
also feels out of place occasionally, as though every time the story
turned back to him it was in danger of losing its way.  The relationship
between the two sisters is the heart of MARVIN'S ROOM, and the other
conflicts and relationships feel intrusive; the focus on DiCaprio makes
you wonder why the character of the other brother (Hal Scardino, who
spends nearly the entire film reading "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea") was
included at all.  But the important factor in MARVIN'S ROOM is that these
people don't get together for the express purpose of watching one of them
die.  Living is more interesting -- and more complicated -- than dying,
and McPherson created a work which recognizes that fact.  You don't have
to have a funeral to touch real emotions.</P>
