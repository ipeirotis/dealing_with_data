<P>     In the '70s and '80s, George Lucas had the Midas touch.  Combining
the STAR WARS saga with the adventures of Indiana Jones, Lucas amassed
a great deal of prestige for himself as well as a lot of money for his
distributors.  Thus, with Lucas' name featured so prominently in the
credits for RADIOLAND MURDERS (executive producer and story), it's
reasonable to have high expectations for the film (especially if you
haven't seen the dreadful previews).  Unfortunately, in this case,
instead of gold, we've been given dross.</P>
<P>     RADIOLAND MURDERS is like some horrible concoction synthesizing
elements of THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and BRAIN DONORS, and setting them in
the world of David Lynch's ON THE AIR.  This film has more gags in it
than anything this side of a Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker production, too few
of which work.  Admittedly, slapstick (like almost all comedy) is
extremely subjective, but you have to have a rather low laughter
threshold to find much of the sit-com style humor in RADIOLAND MURDERS
to be more funny than tedious.</P>
<P>     The first twenty minutes of the film are actually relatively
promising, with lots of fast cuts and snappy dialogue.  With an
inventive script, this sort of pace could have made for a wonderfully
wild ride.  Unfortunately, RADIOLAND MURDERS' screenplay is empty,
resulting in a movie whose frantic style makes it more tiresome and
chaotic than fast-paced.</P>
<P>     The story takes place in radio's heyday during the inaugural
on-air night for the new fourth network, WBN.  Based in Chicago, WBN
has been set up as a rival to NBC, CBS, and ABC.  It has an impressive
list of programs, including such nightly favorites as "The Black Whip,"
"Home Is Where the Heart Is," "Gork:  Son of Fire," and (my personal
favorite) "Johnny Ace: Hard-Boiled Dick."</P>
<P>     As the night's festivities get underway, Penny Henderson (Mary
Stuart Masterson), the station's General Secretary, is running around
trying to get everyone in position while fending off the apologetic
advances of a husband (Brian Benben) she believes to be unfaithful.
Disorder rules, and things really start to get messy when an
unauthorized voice makes an menacing pronouncement over an open mike.
Shortly thereafter, the first of many deaths occurs.  Even the arrival
of Lt. Cross (Michael Lerner) of the Chicago Police Department can't
stop the killings--and the prime suspect turns out to be Penny's
husband, Roger.</P>
<P>     I won't claim that there are no laughs in this film, although most
of my chuckles came from witty one-liners rather than the endless
attempts at slapstick.  However, the movie's limited comic success
doesn't justify one-hundred seven minutes of idiotic plotting and
pointless zaniness.  Silly motion pictures are often enjoyable, but
only when there's a modicum of creativity and inventiveness behind
them.  RADIOLAND MURDERS lacks those qualities.</P>
<P>     Of course, with ILM involved in the production, the visual and
audio effects are expected to be top-notch, which they are.  The cast
is also impressive, although, other than Mary Stuart Masterson, Brian
Benben, and Scott Michael Campbell, few of them get much screen time,
and no one is given an opportunity to really shine.  RADIOLAND MURDERS
is a movie of gimmicks, not actors.</P>
<P>     As a pioneering picture for the "future wave of special effects,"
RADIOLAND MURDERS makes an effective proving ground.  As a piece of
entertainment, its value is somewhat more dubious.  Lucas, his four
screenwriters, and director Mel Smith try hard to make us laugh but, as
was the case in John Turturro's four-cylinder misfire BRAIN DONORS,
this motion picture reinforces the simple truth that jokes don't
necessarily equate to humor.</P>
