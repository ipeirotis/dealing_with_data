<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Yes. A war zone can be fun for restless teens with hot blood and a
passion for mischief. In Ziad Doueiri's semi-autobigraphical film about
his growing up as a teenager in the 1970s in the middle of the civil war
that rocked Beirut, that is the strongest message I received from his
irreverent look at what he did during the war years. It was filmed by
someone who knows the mood of that critical time, the real dangers that
were there, the music that was played, and the tensions that gripped the
city. In this shoestring budgeted indie, Doueiri does a nice job of
detailing how his Muslim community of West Beirut reacted to all the
violence; and, how he and his friends and his bourgeois parents endured.
His intellectual father Riad (Joseph Bou Nassar) being the eternal
optimist and his lawyer mother Hala (Carmen Lebbos) constantly feeling
panicked by the events. The film shows how through all the turmoil his
parents showed much affection to their only child, as he was doted upon
by both of them. This is a hearfelt film about his coming-of-age during
that strife. The 36-year-old filmmaker studied at UCLA and was the
cameraman for Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.</P>
<P>The 15-year-old protagonist, Tarek (Rami Doueiri, nonprofessional actor
and the director's brother), is the school joker. In the opening scene
he stops the singing of the "Marseillaise" at his French-speaking
high-school by climbing above the students gathered in the school yard
and using a megaphone to sing the Lebanese national anthem. When he is
removed from class because of his insolence, he witnesses the massacre
of a busload of 31 Muslims by masked terrorists--it's April 13, 1975,
the start of the war between Muslims and Christians that leaves Beirut
divided into Christian East Beirut and Muslim West Beirut. It is a
chaotic war that is to last for 14 years, leaving the city in ruin. But
when Tarek witnessed the attack, he wasn't sure who the attackers were
and why they were there.</P>
<P>Tarek's father thinks this war will be like the others he has lived
through, and the Americans will force a negotiation and it will be
settled very quickly. His wife is confused about what is happening and
wishes to flee the city. But, as Riad says, this is our home, there is
no other place I would feel comfortable fitting in. Tarek and his best
friend, the short but peppy Omar (Mohamad Chamas, a Beirut street kid
and thief), don't see things the way the adults do. They are happy that
their school, in Christian East Beirut, is closed to them and they can
horse around in the street and spend their time with the hobby they both
have a passion for, Super-8 filmmaking.</P>
<P>Tarek becomes infatuated with May (Rola Al Amin), the pretty Catholic
refugee girl from his school who wears a cross and lives in Muslim West
Beirut. They become a trio though Omar is, at first, displeased with her
and calls her "the Virgin Mary." The film is not plot oriented, it
relies on a bunch of episodic incidents to take place before Tarek gets
it through his clownish skull and smirking face that this city has
changed and won't be the same again. His adventures are driven by his
sexual curiosity, but he will soon realize it's not that easy to be so
carefree anymore. One character angrily tells him when he is aimlessly
running through the streets, "What planet are you from?" When they go to
develop film in a neighborhood where they have to cross the border to
the East, there is a sense of imminent danger that the trio didn't
realize until then really existed. They go to a brothel where safe
passage means you have use women's underwear as a white flag to avoid
being shot at by snipers. Here, they meet the legendary madam Oum Walid
(Leila Karam). She tells them for certain that Beirut has changed, and
it finally sinks in that Beirut is no longer the cosmopolitan
Mediterranean city it once was.</P>
<P>We get a feel for what the director lived through as the friendly Tarek
is shown relating to his neighbors. He has a wonderful relationship with
the neighborhood baker (Mahmoud Mabsout); a comical relationship with
his complaining neighbor (Liliane Nemry), who is great with cursing out
those she doesn't like with shouts of: "May Allah spread pain all over
you;" and, she tells Tarek's mother: "Your son is a blood clot in my
vein." There's the neighborhood bully called Papa Snake (Khalil), who is
disliked by Tarek for intimidating the baker to give him flour for
protection.</P>
<P>The director also presents us with a flavor of the slang language used
by the locals, with expressions such as: "You're shish-kabobing me on a
small flame;" or "You drive like Steve McQueen;" and, about a buxom
woman Omar says, "What a piece of lamb!"</P>
<P>The film was good at given us a realistic look at how one family looked
at those troubled times, rather than for having anything political to
say. We are not getting a history lesson here, but a grown man's look
back at a period of eight years of his youthful life. The film did this
in a rather ordinary way, so that there is nothing deeper to dig out of
Ziad Doueiri's story. Rami Doueiri was a lively teenager. Mohamad Chamas
was equally feisty as his main man. It seemed to be a story that the
director had to tell, and he shared what he saw with an audience that
more than likely only followed the long civil war in the news stories
and had no idea how it looked first-hand. This was a film that had no
pretenses about it; it just told the story it knew.</P>
