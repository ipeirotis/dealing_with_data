<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>For Ms. Deepa Mehta -- Fire is the first film of her trilogy on the
elements, this her second, and Water, to be filmed later, will be her
third. She is the India-born, now living in Canada, director of this
sweeping panoramic film about the Partition of India in 1947, which
resulted in the greatest migration of people ever, 12 million, plus the
slaughter of one million on all sides as a result of the conflict. The
Partition was decided unilaterally by the British- with India, whose
majority is Hindus, and Pakistan, whose majority is Muslims, becoming
separate countries. It is seen through the naive eyes of a crippled
(polio-afflicted) 8-year-old girl, Lenny-Baby (Maia), living in Lahore,
who represents the book's author, Bapsi Sidhwa, as a child.</P>
<P>She hears the arguments over the partition in her house over dinner, as
an arrogant British official gets into a fight over how India will miss
the British who kept all the different religions from killing each
other, as he argues with a fanatical Sikh (a religion which combines
tenets of both Hinduism and Islam). Then the ominous signs of the
near-future come up again, when Lenny-Baby is in the park (Queens
Gardens) where a multireligious group of Shanta's friends meet daily and
discuss the current issues. The group of friends, include Hasan the
Muslim masseur (Khanna), Sher Singh the Sikh (Gulshan Grover), Muslim
Imam Din (Khalbushan Khalbanda), and Muslim Dil Nawaz (Khan), the Ice
Candy Man.Their discussions about independence and British withdrawal
from the region, brings about a growing tension among them, as Shanta,
who is apolitical, wishes that they do not discuss their heated
differences when she is present.</P>
<P>The film offers a powerful history lesson of how religion is used as an
excuse to grab land and vent violence against another people in the name
of nationalism, as each side got trapped in the war fever, with Muslim
against Hindu-Sikh, with each side guilty of massacring, kidnapping, and
raping each other. The hope of India remaining peaceful is viewed best
through the eyes of a Parsee family, the upper-class madame of the
house, the gentle Bunty (Kitu), and her practical-minded husband, Rustom
(Arif), and their precocious daughter Lenny, as the family tries to
bring all sides together. Lenny's nanny is the warmly pretty Hindu girl,
Shanta (Nandita Das), who has attracted all the men in her group, but is
being actively pursued by two handsome Muslim young men, Hasan, an
inventor of a product made from fish oil that can grow hair on bald
people, and Dil Navaz, someone who is a voice of reason in the Muslim
community. Lenny-Baby tags along with Shanta, whom she considers to be
her best friend, and is, at first, fascinated watching the rascal-like
Dil try to win Shanta over and then becoming more concerned that she
will lose her best friend to the earnest, soft-spoken Hasan, whom she
sees Shanta falling in love with.</P>
<P>The Parsees who are descended from Muslims, fled Persia in the ninth
century to migrate to India, and have been an insignificant part of the
India population ever since their arrival. They aim to remain neutral in
all the conflicts, to emulate the Swiss during WW11. They believe they
can be invisible, spreading sweetness to the land like sugar placed in
the middle of a glass of milk. Besides, they realize it is the only way
they can survive in this country.</P>
<P>The story picks up steam with independence acclaimed as a great day by
the politicians, but in a Lahore, Pakistan, train station (the Lahore
scenes were filmed in New Delhi as the Pakistani government never got
around to granting the filmmaker permission to shoot there), Dil is
anxiously waiting for his sisters to arrive from just across the border
in Gurdaspur, India. The train pulls in late and when Dil looks on
board, the carnage is horrifying as everyone is brutally murdered, with
his sisters breasts removed and placed in gunnysacks filled with the
severed breasts of other Muslim women. This experience shatters Dil's
faith in a peaceful solution and a hatred grows within him. There is one
last hope, as he tells Shanta, that his love for her is stronger than
any hatred, and only she can prevent him from joining the cause of
inflicting a violent upheaval against his outnumbered neighbors, by
marrying him. But she chooses the more gentle Hasan, whom she plans to
marry and live with in India, as he tells her that he will convert to
Hinduism for her.</P>
<P>Lahore's Hindu section is burnt to the ground and total violence becomes
the rule of the day, after the train incident. The gardener (Yadav) in
the Parsee household converts to being a Muslim rather than being
persecuted. A 10- year- old sweeper's daughter is married off to an old
dwarf so that the Hindu family can convert to Christianity, as Lenny's
mother comments, amidst the surreal gaiety of the wedding replete with
song and dance, "Fear makes all of us to abandon reason." There is
danger for everyone in Lahore who isn't a Muslim or isn't active in the
Muslim cause, even the neutrality of the Parsee's home is compromised
and Shanta comes under danger from betrayal.</P>
<P>The problem with the film is twofold; one, is that all these tragic
events are translated through the childish eyes of Lenny, who cannot
grasp everything that is happening, she just doesn't have the maturity
to do that. Because of that, the story has too much of a childish flavor
to it and is simplified to a point that touches on being too fine. The
tragic historical statistics speak for themselves and it is unnecessary
to be hammered over the head by repeatedly seeing the events unfold
through the eyes of an innocent child. The horror is already a given and
doesn't have to be reinforced by Lenny throwing a dish on the floor and
then asking her mother, if a country could be broken into pieces like
that. It was an unneeded artifice, that tended to spoil the flow of the
film's dramatics. The other problem, with this otherwise splendid
history lesson and tragic love story, is that all the movie's metaphors
are used as if they were merely to amplify the historical tale. The
character's lives were reduced in scope and they seemed to be milked for
the benefit of making the story fit into the historical text.</P>
<P>Earth is based on a semiautobiographical novel by Bapsi Sidhwa, called
"Cracking India." It is stunningly photographed, using reds and purples
to express the blood-curdling scenes of Lahore under siege and a glowing
yellow for the warm household scenes and a brownish amber to catch the
vast beauty of the countryside. It is noteworthy for exploring in detail
the destruction of innocence and the arbitrary splitting up of the
earth, and how everyone gets caught up in the emotional frenzy of hatred
and how difficult it is to just do what is right. This is an on-going
conflict that still threatens the earth today, and with both Pakistan
and India armed with atomic weapons, which only makes their religious
conflict more perilous.</P>
<P>There was a certain power the film had, that could not be denied.
Nandita Das as Shanta, is the heart of the picture. Her performance is
breathtaking, as she slowly finds love with Hasan, remains friendly with
Dil Nawaz, and generously serves the Sethna family and is the human face
we remember about the violence and the betrayal taking place in Lahore.
Her performance was very moving and gave life to this epic film. But,
Aamir Khan as Dil Nawaz, a very popular actor in India, is the force
behind the film. His masterful performance, changing from an endearing
and helpful figure, to one who embraces violence, was what put a human
face of evil on this melodrama and saved the film from being thought of
as mostly a metaphorical historical exercise.</P>
