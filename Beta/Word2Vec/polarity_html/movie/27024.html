<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An alluring biopic about the provocative comedian Andy Kaufman that
couldn't go futher than to provide an entertaining look at the
entertainer. If one was looking to find out who Andy Kaufman was, this
film would be of little help. The point of the film being that there was
probably no difference between the performer and the person off-stage,
therefore it believes by telling the story through only his performances
should give one a good enough idea of who Andy was. Every other
character besides Andy in the film seemed wooden, whose only purpose was
to look up and stare at him as if he were a God or sneer at him as if he
was the Devil. The Kaufman role was tailor-made for Jim Carrey and he
comes through with flying colors in a virtuoso performance, as this
fictionalized biography of Kaufman, shows his odd personality,
obsessions, and mind-set.</P>
<P>The film seemed flat in the parts when Carrey wasn't performing and his
story seemed superficial. I didn't feel as if I knew him any better
because of this film than I did before, though, at least, the film
didn't try to answer something it couldn't. But "Man on the Moon" was
entertaining, even for someone like me who has never been impressed by
his comic talents.</P>
<P>The film about 'the king of negative energy' starts with a prologue,
where Jim Carrey says, "Hello ... I am Andy." He then convinces us
without a doubt that is exactly who he is. He first shows us his
abnormal childhood, where he would play alone and perform his act before
an imaginary audience in his room rather than play with other children,
greatly upsetting his parents. He is raised in the affluent Long Island
suburb of Great Neck, but before we can gather anything else about his
childhood and his relations with his parents and his sister, we are
quickly whisked from here to Andy as a young adult doing an unfunny act
at a nightclub, where we have no trouble seeing how he would be fired,
which is indeed what happens. Suddenly he turns up doing an Elvis
impersonation at a comedy club attended by super-agent George Shapiro
(DeVito) and he's taken on by the agent who thinks he might have
discovered a comic genius, and soon he becomes a star on 'Saturday Night
Live.' From there he lands a starring role in a new sitcom, 'Taxi,' and
is allowed to make a number of demands from the producers in order to
land him, as he always tries to push the limits on what he can do. This
might be the way it happened, but it made for bad cinema since he wasn't
seen as being funny and his immediate rise to fame lacked credibility as
it was filmed, even though we know it evidently did happen.</P>
<P>The heart of the film and indeed what keeps it lively, is watching
Carrey go through his repertoire in a flawless comic manner. He seems to
have all of Andy's top acts down pat, as he has the ability to do
impeccable imitations of Kaufman as an impersonator, such as the buggy
wide-eyed immigrant Latka; the confrontational wrestler bullying the
women he fights with in the ring; his ongoing scripted spat with the
wrestler Jerry Lawler which appealed to the crowds baser instincts;
performing a reading of the entire "The Great Gatsby" to a bored college
audience; performing as the obnoxious Tony Clifton (his alter ego), who
is a lounge singer who goads his audience on in a hostile manner; and,
acting childish while doing lip-syncs to a phonograph record of the
"Mighty Mouse" theme song, as he would sing out "Here I come to save the
day!" He thrived in his short-lived career in the 1970s, until his death
from cancer in 1984 at the age of 35, on being unpredictable, presenting
a stand-up act that was hard to define because of his uniqueness.</P>
<P>Milos Forman's uneven film is missing the true craziness of Kaufman in
the entirety of the story. He gets that ingredient not from the
conventional way he tells the story but only from Jim Carrey's
expressive performance, as the film went from bursts of great energy
with Carrey doing Andy to dullness in storytelling.</P>
<P>The most jejune part was reserved for Courtney Love as Andy's girlfriend
Lynne. Her part was so underwritten that there weren't even hints of
where the romance or sex in it was, and there appeared to be no intimacy
between them. She just seemed to be Andy's prop, who looks delicious on
the screen but was given nothing to do, but one turn on the wrestling
mat.</P>
<P>What we are left pondering, is if Andy is weird and gimmicky enough to
invite a whole audience out for milk and cookies after he played out his
dream of appearing in Carnegie Hall, could he also be capable of faking
his own death. I can't help thinking, that aside from Carrey's masterful
performance, there's not much in this film to take away with you. The
film seems to be an unadultered homage to Kaufman, looking on the rosy
side of his lunacy and not getting at anything else. Kaufman seemed to
always be searching for something, whether in studying Transcendental
Meditation, looking for a psychic cure for cancer in the Philippines, or
a way to push the limits of comedy to a further degree, and what we see
in the film, is that he never quite found what he was looking for, in a
career that was far too short for a man of his energies and stated
talents.</P>
