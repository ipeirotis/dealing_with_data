<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Windhorse takes us right into modern Tibet and tells how the Tibetans
survive in a country that is not really theirs anymore. It is a
well-done and necessary propaganda film (though even its propaganda is
nuanced and made lyrical to a large extent). Somehow or other the world
has to receive the message from the Tibetans, who are undergoing at the
hands of their suppressors, the Chinese Communists, a policy of genocide
that will probably continue unchecked unless something is done to stop
it. This film is one of the ways of getting out this message. Since
Tibet was invaded in 1950 by the Chinese, and in 1959 they forced the
Dalai Lama to go in exile, with the unbelievable explanation that they
were liberating the country, there have been over a million Tibetans
slaughtered, 6,000 temples ruined, and over 100,000 have fled the
country by walking over the dangerous Himalayan terrain. This
fictionalized drama has to be told and this serious film (probably
preaching to the choir) cannot be judged as other films are for its
entertainment value. If you are seeing this film to be entertained, you
are in the wrong movie house, though the exquisite natural beauty of the
country and the entrancing holy city of Lhasa- and its Potala (the
largest Buddhist structure in the world)- offer quite a lot of sights to
behold.</P>
<P>The brutality the Tibetans are under is clearly shown, as the film will
tell its story as humanly as it can, through the eyes of one family, and
it will show their hardships and disruptions to be symbolic for the
sufferings of all Tibetans.</P>
<P>The tragedy in this film starts one day in 1979 when the youngsters
Dorjee (Jampa Kelsang when a grownup) and his sister Dolkar
(Tibetan-American singer Dadon when a grownup) and their cousin Pema
(unnamed when a grownup-what a shame! She gave an emotionally great
performance) are skipping rope and Dolkar is singing a childhood ballad,
and the sibling's grandfather is suddenly taken from the house by the
Chinese soldiers and shot because he protested their rule by hanging a
poster that said "Chinese get out of Tibet."</P>
<P>The story will pick up 18 years later when the three are grown, each
choosing different paths. Pema becomes a Buddhist nun, Dolkar a sexy
karaoke singer, whose Chinese boyfriend is a broadcast official named
Duan-ping (Richard Chang), helping advance her singing career, as long
as she performs in Chinese and behaves like a lackey, singing songs
praising Chairman Mao; while, Dorjee remains sullen, unemployed, wasting
his time drinking beer, chain smoking, hanging out with his wise-guy
friends in a pool hall, and brooding how nothing can be done to save his
country, all-the-while cursing the Chinese. He is compelling as the
weary one, not knowing what to do until something tragic happens that
brings out his best instincts and transforms him to do what is right. He
steals the picture with this gut-wrenching performance.</P>
<P>What changes everything for the family, is when Pema is arrested for
spontaneously screaming "Free Tibet" in the streets of the Tibetan
capital, Lhasa, and is beaten to within an inch of her life and then
callously returned to the family where she dies, even though they tried
their best to nurse her back to life in their home. This travesty really
hits home and shames them into actively supporting the non-violent
Tibetan cause for freedom. They are abetted by an American tourist, Amy
(Taije Silverman), who speaks Tibetan and has a video camera, and is
evidently interested in the "real" Tibetan people.</P>
<P>What is simply amazing throughout the story is the gentleness of the
Tibetans, who exhibit no violent tendencies despite all these incidents,
and when you compare them with the barbarian behavior of their Chinese
rulers, you can easily see that this is a story of good vs. evil.</P>
<P>It should be noted how the film had to be made secretly when filmed for
a week in Tibet (most of the film was shot in Nepal) with a video camera
and smuggled out of Tibet (it was shot on digital video and transferred
to film), and how some of the actors were in great danger and thereby
could not use their real names. It is easy to see why China doesn't want
the truth about its human rights violations known, or about the murders
it commits and acts of brutality, and its spy system and systematic
control over its subjects, or how it refuses to allow the people to even
have pictures of the Dalai Lama in their homes, arresting those that do.
All this being done to a people who just happen to have a philosophy of
life filled with compassion and love for everyone.</P>
<P>The film opens and ends on a powerful spiritual note, as you would
expect from a people who value so highly their traditional knowledge of
Buddhism. It shows what a windhorse is, which are prayer flags on the
mountain passes and scraps of paper left on the ground to be ridden by
the wind into the hands of the gods for victory, where each sheet of
paper offers such a prayer for freedom. Thereby, the film will rest its
case that the spirit world will always be there for them.</P>
<P>Director Wagner and screenwriter Tsering have pulled off a major
accomplishment. They made an emotional and a confrontational film, and
they made it inside a totalitarian Chinese regime and they got away with
it. That makes this a very special film for me, but it will probably be
too one-dimensional a story for those who feel it lacks the impact of
dramatics and cannot forgive the film for urgently wishing to send out
its message at the expense of being more "artistic." But I left the
theater with the impression that I was watching a brave people clinging
to the belief that they could find in their hearts all the goodness they
need to get over this dark spot in their history. I thought it was a
well-meaning film that had its exceptional moments, like fully realizing
the relationship of Dadon and Duan-ping as symbolic of the possible
reconciliation of the two countrys. These two lovers slowly come to
believe that they are being duped into thinking that things could work
for them in such a hostile setting, and Dadon realizes she can't betray
her people and be lured into singing on TV for a big contract, while he
knows that he can't be too vocal in his protest or he will be removed
from his position. They both, therefore, must compromise their love
because of current affairs.</P>
<P>But does the film reach an audience that doesn't know theTibetan
situation?</P>
<P>I hope it does reach a wider American audience than what I think it
will, because I  believe that the cause here is just, the acting is
first-class, the film is beautifully crafted, and that all people of
good faith must stand together and give hope to each other, in any small
or large way that they can. If this fictionalized film wasn't about the
real life situation in Tibet and had the same mundane story, I could see
it being criticized for being melodramatic. But since the politics of
the times indicate that this film does make a difference, so much so
that the Chinese government is doing everything in its power to ban it,
I therefore think that speaks volumes for how effective this film is as
a political vehicle and how its cinematic importance is enhanced by the
unflinching bravery of the Tibetan actors and their families still
living in Tibet, still the subject of untold horrors.</P>
