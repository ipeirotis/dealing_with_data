<P>For about twenty minutes into MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 director John Woo (THE 
KILLER, HARD BOILED, FACE OFF) appears to have made an exciting, elegant, 
charming spy thriller, kind of a post millennium James Bond adventure with a 
strapping American (read: unsophisticated) hero more willing to drop kick 
villains than out fox them. Sadly, as the picture progresses, the final 
product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up, two-hour long 
episode of MAGYUVER. And not a particularly good one at that. What went 
wrong? MI2 begins flashily enough, that initial flash leading us to believe 
that it'll soon give way to something of a plot, but it only gives way to 
more flash, then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of 
itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad 
guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of Tom Cruise's firing gun just 
so they can die really cool.</P>
<P>Early on, during a car chase between soon to be lovers Ethan Hunt (Tom 
Cruise) and Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton), Woo works some of his 
trademark magic. In one hypnotic, though completely inexplicable sequence, 
the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as Cruise and his 
stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality… 
just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance, coming ever so 
close to toppling over a neighboring cliff. Prior to this we see the famed 
trailer opener of Cruise climbing a steep mountain, sans scaffolding, then 
leaping from one jagged rock formation to another. Why? I haven't the 
foggiest. I doubt even John Woo could provide you with a logical reply. With 
MI2 Woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine, the one that 
jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity 
defying effects. It's possible that these "spies" could be adrenaline junkies 
climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off, though 
of course this is never explored. The scenes I've described are really only 
included to titillate, not to give any insight into character. God forbid. 
Woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic, but they remain 
individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of 
beer commercial-like visuals.</P>
<P>Still in terms of crackerjack eye candy, the opening has much to cherish. 
Cruise and Newton first meet during a vigorous Flamenco dance featuring 
several welcome Woo devices (the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized 
movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals 
discovering how attractive the other is). Between the frantic dancing, Woo 
trains his camera on Cruise and Newton as they make with some sensuous eye 
contact. The scene is a little over the top in a Bon Jovi music video circa 
1988 kind of way, yet it has style and something of soul, and Woo casts a bit 
of a spell on us. Sure it's all smoke and mirrors, but we can see that there 
happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product. Thandie and 
Cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully 
charming as the Jennifer Lopez\George Cloony trunk meeting in OUT OF SIGHT. 
They flirt and exchange obvious double entendres. Newton bats her eyes 
flirtatiously. Cruise grins a little too slyly.</P>
<P>The Cruise character, Ethan Hunt, has been drastically altered since the 
first film. Here Cruise plays him more as a hip, sexual dynamo than the 
square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1. He's cool and dashing, which is 
precisely the kind of role we want to see Cruise in after watching him sleep 
walk through EYES WIDE SHUT (which might just be the longest episode of RED 
SHOW DIARIES ever committed to film), and blustered his way through MAGNOLIA 
(quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's). Sadly as the 
film progresses we see less of Cruise's initial "I'm the man!" charm and more 
slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug.</P>
<P>MI2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act, which 
is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop. The whole 
thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle (the first gun fight in 
the film), which really should be unheard of in a John Woo film, but alas 
this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from Renny Harlin to 
Joseph Merhi (of course excepting the "symbolic" pigeons who seem to find 
their way into every John Woo picture). We've all seen guys slide across the 
floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand. It isn't done any 
differently here.</P>
<P>The action is pure HARD TARGET\BROKEN ARROW theatrics with nothing to propel 
it but the apparent need to see Tom Cruise drop kick face less villains while 
his hair whips stylishly in the wind. He's cool for sure but he's made to be 
as empty as the movie. The actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as 
for his chiseled looks; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at 
literally any moment, be it during a gunfight, before one or after one. When 
he's not beaming away, he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to 
look mad as hell, but Woo's editing seriously undermines the effort. He 
fetishizes Cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a NAKED 
GUN style spoof. I half expected Cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal 
that he's really Austin Powers.</P>
<P>In a classic Woo action moment, Ethan Hunt struts past a fiery doorway 
glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death. The 
gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which 
turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for 
Cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual (one dumb bastard 
even jumps his bike over the gun toting Cruise, basically inviting our 
handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does). The lead bad guy 
(played by the appropriately British Dougray Scott) and Cruise face off in a 
mentally deficient game of chicken…on motorcycles. Though instead of jumping 
off to the side at the last moment, the two grown men leap directly into the 
other giving each other a mid air bear hug, only to fly about a hundred feet 
(still in bear hug position), land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano 
fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a "so you thought I was 
dead...". Not to worry, Cruise takes care of the problem without even 
breaking a sweat. What a hero!</P>
<P>You may have noticed that I opted not to describe an iota of MI2's plot. My 
reasoning is simple: I'm not sure of any good it would do. The film itself 
has absolutely no concern with story, only with hurtling forth to the next 
"special" effect. I wasn't kidding when I told a friend of mine that MI2 has 
less plot than the average Aerosmith video. Nobody will go to this for the 
plot, and if they do they'll surely regret it. As summer movies evolve (or 
devolve) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly 
nothing. In MI, the plot seemed to be built around Brian De Palma's (that 
film's director) stylistic flourishes, while in MI2 the plot only serves to 
give us an intermittent breather from Woo's non-stop masturbatory 
pandemonium. It's irrelevant in every sense, as is character. All that 
ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors.</P>
