<PRE>                              GRACE OF MY HEART
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     GRACE OF MY HEART is a happy and delightful show that celebrates
the creative process of song writing.  Mainly set in the 60s, it tells
the story of wannabe singer Edna Buxton (Illeana Douglas).  After being
rejected as a singer, she discovers her better talent which is
composing the music and lyrics for a host of marvelous songs.  GRACE OF
MY HEART is her fictional autobiography.</P>
<P>     I read that most of the people in the film are loosely based on
real stars, but that is a distraction that I ignored while watching the
film.  Better to concentrate on the sweet little story at hand.</P>
<P>     It is 1958 and at a big white mansion, gawky looking Edna Buxton
is trying on a strapless and low cut gown for her singing contest.  She
complains, "Mother, the dress doesn't fit."  Her mother puts her down
with, "the dress fits the occasion.  It's you that doesn't fit."</P>
<P>     In her first starring role, normally supporting actress, Douglas
is perfectly cast and performs flawlessly.  You may remember her as the
ice skater Janice from TO DIE FOR and the woman who gets disfigured in
CAPE FEAR.  She has none of the normal Hollywood glamorous looks.  She
is somewhat attractive, but her eyes and mouth seem a size too large
for her face giving her a natural look unlike the typical fashion model
appearance so popular in actresses today.  She gives a compelling and
always believable performance.  As she tries hard to succeed she has
all of the audience rooting for her.</P>
<P>     When she attempts to sell herself in New York as a singer, she
gets rejection after rejection.  Typical is the record producer who
tells her, "Nice voice, toots.  The thing is we already have someone
just like you."  If that is not enough, he goes on, "I don't want to
burst your bubble, but not only do we have someone like you.  We are
trying to get rid of the someone like you."  Just then the record
buying public had decided that female soloist were out, and male voices
were in.  Bad gender timing.</P>
<P>     She gets introduced to record producer Joel Millner (John
Turturro) who likes her songs, but only for his black singing group,
not for her.  Unstoppable Edna turns to song writing only until her
singing career can take off.  Joel fixes her lousy name and image
problem.  He christens her Denise Waverly and tells the world she is a
struggling song writer from a Philly tenement.</P>
<P>     Turturro demonstrates for the first time, at least to me, his
tremendous comedic abilities.  He is terrific as Denise's ever
domineering boss and mentor, and it is one of my favorite roles of his.
It is worth the price of admission just to see the chemistry between
them and their artistry.</P>
<P>     Denise forms a romantic attachment to fellow song writer and
pseudo-intellectual Howard Cazsatt (Eric Stoltz).  Her career goes
south fast with him.  Their first song together is a true story about a
twelve year old girl who gets pregnant.  It and their next four songs
all get band by the church and the record distributors.</P>
<P>     Her career takes off again when she starts collaborating with
Cheryl Steed (Patsy Kensit).  They are even successful in creating
songs for TV star and ingenue Kelly Porter (Bridget Fonda) whom they
figure has more hairspray than brains.</P>
<P>     Bruce Davison plays the part of married DJ John Murray who falls
for Denise.  Given Douglas's charisma, the audience feels like
complaining, take a number since they are enchanted with her too.
Denise eventually ends up with the lead, Jay Phillips (Matt Dillon), of
the Beach Boy look-alike group The Rip Tides.  Dillon gives a space out
performance of a spaced out guy, but it is so ethereal that his acting
left me cold.</P>
<P>     The first two thirds of the show is set in New York and is by far
and away the best part.  When Denise leaves in the late 60s to live on
the beach in Malibu, she starts to lose creative energy and interest
and so does the film itself.  If writer and director Allison Anders had
just stopped with the NYC part, she would have had made a brilliant
picture.  Like a pitcher who stays on the mound too long, Anders loses
her touch and the film goes astray on the California coast.</P>
<P>     Once in Surf City Denise gets down on herself declaring "maybe I
put too much of myself into my songs."  When she starts back on her
career, Jay declares opposition with, "the only thing I wish for you,
and I wish it most sincerely, I wish you would get fired."  Still she
protects Jay later by telling his equally spaced out doctor, "he smokes
some grass.  He uses some psychedelics.  He uses peyote, but he is down
on hard drugs."</P>
<P>     Her crutch throughout is Millner.  When she gets thin and
despondent, he shows up with food and little homilies like, "You look
like a vampire.  Eat your hamburger.  All that health food stuff will
kill you."</P>
<P>     This is an extremely rewarding film, flawed only by the plodding
last part on the West Coast.  There are twenty-eight songs in it, and
most of them were made just for the film.  All of the songs are full of
high energy and reminiscent of the period.  I left feeling I just had
my batteries recharged.</P>
<P>     My favorite part of the film, other than the mesmerizing
performances by Douglas and Turturro, is the insights the film provides
into the hard work required to produce a hit single.  Many scenes take
place in the recording studio where the rapport between the song
writers, the performers, and the record producer is a key to success.
I learned a lot by watching this fascinating bit of collaboration.</P>
<P>     The script is a gem.  When Denise first meets Howard, he is
pompous towards her but claims to have liked her first hit.  She asks
him, "What exactly did you like about my record?  The thickness of the
vinyl?"  When Cheryl is coaching a group of lethargic singers, she
barks at them, "come on girls.  This is supposed to be upbeat, not
uptight.  Get happy."</P>
<P>     The technical aspects of the production are also meritorious.  The
cinematography by Jan Yves Escoffier reminded me almost of the colorful
work by Jean Rabier in THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG.  My favorite image
is of the streets of New York at dusk with the neon lights glowing.
The costumes (Susan Bertram), make-up, hair styling, and sets (Francois
Seguin) all contribute to the authenticity of the film.</P>
<P>     Finally, my favorite small touch in the picture is the use of the
Theremin musical instrument by The Rip Tides.  As documented in the
engrossing film THEREMIN: AN ELECTRONIC ODYSSEY, this little instrument
was used in everything from science fiction movies to Beach Boy music.
Check out my review of the movie in the Internet Movie Data Base and
then rent the video if you can find it.</P>
<P>     GRACE OF MY HEART runs 1:55.  It is rated R for some bad language
and a couple of scenes of dope smoking.  There is no violence, no sex
and a single very brief nude scene at a commune.  The show would be
fine for most teenagers with only the brief drug usage scenes to be a
possible concern.  This is an easy show to watch and to enjoy, and
hence one definitely worth a recommendation.  The languid and
atypically morose last part of the show detracted from my rating, but
it still gets *** from me.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
