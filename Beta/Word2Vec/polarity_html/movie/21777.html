<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Racial hatred is something that we are not born with. It is a learned
response. "American History X" examines how two Los Angeles brothers
learn how to hate from their families, their communities, their schools,
their friends, and from a country that doesn't fulfill everyone's
expectations of it. Films of this nature are very difficult to do;
firstly, because they tend to become merely message vehicles and,
secondly, hatred is a mindset that must be unlearned and films tend to
think that they must sermonize to get their good intentions across and
sermons as a rule do not make for pleasing dramatics. When this film is
most effective, it goes for the jugular of its racist veins and pulls
back no punches, using lucid arguments about why there is racial
disharmony in this country and it does so in the language used on the
street. When it backtracks and feels that it has to explain itself and
sort of apologize for what it has shown, and allows the main character
off the racial hook rather abruptly, the story seems to weaken and
become somewhat artificial like so many other films of this ilk, afraid
to let completely go and allow the chips to fly where they may. What the
producers of the film might be afraid of, is that the message about why
youngsters become racists was too convincingly done, that their gripes
are too reasonable and might leave a bitter taste in the mouths of those
who can't face the realities of life in contemporary America. That this
is a country where so many of the nasty newspaper headlines seem to be
about racial problems; and, also, this is a country that is consumed by
its bad karma from its past racial history to its unsettling now and it
is thereby impossible to hide from these problems wherever one lives in
this country. But to live in an American city that has changed from
being an all-white one_to_ one with many blacks, seems to only
exasperate the racial problems. This film convincingly exploits this
racial tension, up to a point, as it tantalizes the audience with a
reality that is lived out for real in many of the viewer's everyday
lives, as many of them are the innocent ones caught in the cross-fire of
those extreme racists on both sides of the color line.</P>
<P>So one of the questions that crosses my mind, is what can this film add
to our knowledge of hatred that would make us feel we are onto some way
of dealing with it any better than we have until now? Perhaps it is an
unfair or an unanswerable question and not the purpose of any film to
do, but after seeing so much ugliness on screen, using gang violence,
race baiting attitudes, and the polarization of the races to make its
point about the current social crisis, it makes one wonder what is the
method to unlearning the hatred learned, especially when all the great
religious leaders and artists and philosophers could only reach those
who were convinced already that hatred was wrong and couldn't change the
world into an harmonious place, even if their message was an eloquent
and a correct one. I expect this film will actually be relished for its
provocative stance and its real sense of  hatred it was able to
duplicate in those white or black punks committing the violence, with
the extreme views of hatred outweighing any other message the film was
trying to deliver. And that is the beauty of the film; the real lesson
it puts on the table, the one that must be confronted; it is what makes
this film invaluable and genuine, a documentary-style look at racism.</P>
<P>In Britisher Tony Kaye's debut feature, after a successful career in
doing TV commercials, he brings some of the attention getting scenes
that commercials use to reach the consumer and has come up with a
riveting film that paints a necessary ugly racial picture in bold
black-and-white photography during some of its more graphically violent
scenes. But the director was not satisfied with the finished product,
claiming that the film's star, Edward Norton, re-edited the final
version giving himself more screentime and that the studio themselves
changed the film so that it could be more acceptable to a greater
audience. The film did have an incomplete look to it and its ending did
seem to be missing something, as there appeared to be holes in the story
and the film ended too abruptly to make sense. Nevertheless, the
director did a good job, this is a provocative film and it is one that
is grounded in reality and will be remembered for its powerful images of
hatred.</P>
<P>How do people feel when they see such changes for the worst in their
neighborhood and lump all people into stereotypes, is answered by Derek
Vinyard (Edward Norton); he joins a skinhead neo-Nazi group after the
last straw of his rationality is broken when his firefighter father
(Russ) is senselessly killed by a sniper in a black neighborhood while
putting out a fire in a crack house. We will learn later on through one
of the many flashbacks used, that his father taught the kid to have
these racists views, as we listen to them converse over dinner.</P>
<P>The story takes place in Venice Beach, and Derek tells us that blacks
and Hispanics have moved here recently from the ghettoes of L.A. and
have changed the fabric of the once peaceful community, by scaring the
white kids in school, bringing drugs and gangs into the area, and taking
over the basketball courts (there was a basketball game between the
skinheads and the black gang members over who will control the court
that seemed too facile to be that convincing).</P>
<P>"American History X " follows the life of the articulate rabble-rouser
Derek and his impressionable younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong), as
they try to find their real identities in life. For the past year after
his father's death, Derek has become a fanatical member of a neo-Nazi
gang which is influenced by a devious adult, Cameron Alexander (Keach),
who keeps in the background as he manipulates the boys with his sinister
hatred and gets the willing Derek to recruit and organize other
disenfranchised whites into the gang. Derek has many Nazi-type of
tattoos on his body, but the one that stands out like an emblazoned
emblem of holy sanctimony, is the giant swastika over his heart.</P>
<P>His mother (D'Angelo) is dating a liberal-minded Jewish teacher from the
local high school, Murray (Gould), and has invited him over for dinner,
and the family is discussing the Rodney King case, with the contrasting
views argued by Derek in a passionate manner as he is defending the
white cops while in a low key manner by Murray, who is appalled at the
police brutality shown against the black man. The rational part of their
argument comes to an end, as Derek's anti-Semitism is raised to a
feverish pitch at the sight of Murray sitting at the family table and
going out with his mother, and this causes a verbal barrage of hatred by
him directed at the befuddled school teacher, who is forced to leave the
house and end the budding relationship with Derek's mother.</P>
<P>That night while Derek is having sex with his neo-Nazi girlfriend Stacey
(Balk), Danny spots a black youth breaking into their van and alerts his
brother. Derek comes out with his automatic weapon and kills two of
them, with the third escaping. But the cops come to the scene and arrest
him in front of his house, in the most powerful scene of the film, he is
standing in his underwear, topless, with his swastika standing out in
the nighttime sky, as he feels so proud of what he has done, that he
raises his eyebrows and gives off with an obscene smirk like the good
neo-Nazi he has become under Cameron's tutelage. For this act, he
receives three- years in jail, and his life will drastically change, as
he learns the errors of his ways the hard way, reminescent of the old
familiar Western story of the gunman giving up his guns and returning to
town as a peacemaker.</P>
<P>In jail, prisoners cling together by race. Being white in prison means
you are in the minority, and as one of the black inmates, Lamont
(Torry), who reluctantly befriends the angry Derek on a laundry work
detail they share, as he tells him, "In here, you are the 'nigger'."</P>
<P>In order to be protected from the blacks who are out to get him, Derek
stays with the white power faction. But when the white leader rapes him
in the shower, he disses the group by refusing to sit with them at the
dining room. He was also disillusioned that his group didn't believe as
seriously as he did in the message about "white power" and made
political deals with the blacks and Hispanics. His protection is now
over and he is seen as a disheartened outcast. To his surprise, Lamont
puts out the word among the blacks to leave him alone and because of
this, Derek's racial feelings change and he can now look at blacks as
being human again, and so he decides that he can't go back to his
neo-Nazi gang again. This was the hardest part of the film to swallow
whole, especially when the change comes about so rapidly and the film
did not do a good enough job storywise of showing how this change could
be internally possible. What excelled though, was the acting, especially
by Norton, who understood his role and got the most out of it.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, back at school, Danny has Murray as his history teacher and
for homework writes a paper on Mein Kampf as an example of a great work
on civil rights, which upsets the teacher. The principal of the school,
a black man, Dr. Sweeney, has two doctorates-- he is depicted as being
twice as good as anyone in this film, and will be the bridge of sanity
for the film, working to help his students beyond the call of duty. He
was Derek's teacher and enjoyed having the bright student in class and
had visited him in jail, vouching for his early release from prison on
the condition he stops Danny from making the same mistakes he did. What
he decides to do for Danny, is to remove him from his history class and
take a new subject with him called American History X. As his first
assignment, he is to write a report about what led his brother to prison
and hand it in to him tomorrow. This 24-hour period will prove itself to
be eventful, because Derek gets released from prison and confronts the
skinheads telling them that he no longer will be in their organization.
This part of the story was too incredulous and sketchy for it to be
anything but a well-intentioned but misguided effort at making
everything turn out to be pat. Dr. Sweeney was also too sketchy a
characterization for the film to feel fluid. He seemed to be placed
there to provide the film with a safe way out of its difficult dilemma
it dug for itself regarding the extremity of race relations. But it was
just that extremity and its rawness that gave the film the kind of edge
to it that made it potent.</P>
<P>Danny has been under Cameron's influence while Derek did his time. He is
also being befriended by an overweight loser and fanatical neo-Nazi,
Seth (Suplee). The only character in the story that has the right energy
to counter the neo-Nazi influence on her hero-worshipping brother, is
his sister, Davina (Jennifer Lien). She is solid. Her anger and
impatience with the nonsense she is hearing is right on target. In her
small part- it's too bad she wasn't given more to say, she outshines the
arguments against hatred presented by her weak mother, the ineffective
Murray, and the too good to be real principal.</P>
<P>Another horrible scene to look at, is the flashback of the gang in
action, led by Derek, rampaging through a Korean grocery store wrecking
the place, violating the black lady cashier and humiliating the Koreans
by putting different food all over their faces and beating them-  scenes
like this are all done in black and white- it is only when Derek reforms
his ways when out of prison that the film becomes ready to be in
technicolor.</P>
<P>The most obvious flaw of the film, is that Derek's ultra right-wing
arguments against liberals and how the blacks are ruining the country,
never get answered back in a satisfactory way. There is no one to speak
up for what most people in America think is fair. And so when the tragic
ending to the film takes place, what is there to say! We have seen the
worst about America, how herd-like certain people can behave and how the
prison and the Venice Beach that is depicted both lump people into
groups because of race. But if this is the current reality, then there
are certainly alternative realities, where different human beings can
live together in peace, which the film tried to show through Dr.
Sweeney's presence, but that didn't work because his actions seemed too
contrived.</P>
<P>It is too bad that Derek couldn't see how rotten his ideas were in time,
maybe his intelligence wasn't all that it was cracked up to be. Or,
maybe someone like Cameron, whom he will eventually call a "chicken
hawk" because of his cowardly nature, was too good at preying on the
very vulnerable youngsters who need to belong to some hate group to
express themselves and that his mother was too enfeebled to raise him
properly, and there was no one else around to reach him. He didn't seem
like he was a criminal or the typical dumb skinhead type, but he seemed
as if he was someone who got confused over his bad ideas and didn't know
what else to do. In my opinion, the film didn't really capture the
mindset of the neo-Nazi wholly, it just peeked in on them and was
starting to zero in on their psyche and why they become skinheads and
what makes them exit from being one, but it ended up by just lumping
them together with all the other sterotyped groups and failed to go far
enough in showing us what makes them, in particular, tick. There just
seemed to be too much ground this film was trying to cover and it just
couldn't adequately cover the entire history of contemporary racism
without turning the film into a documentary.</P>
<P>But this is still a quality film, that is both visually powerful and
disturbing, showing how much dirt there is to bring up about America's
ever-present racial problems. I just wish the film didn't give us an
entire year's history curriculum about racism in two hours. If it didn't
back off from its characterization of Derek and Danny, and if it kept
hitting the sore points in society that ordinary people find hard to
talk about without getting overwrought or emotionally racial about, we
might have had a great film. The potential for this good film to be much
better than it was, was certainly there for the taking. And who can know
for sure if Tony Kaye is right about what he says ruined his film. I
guess all we can do is wait for his next film and see what he does with
that one before we can fully accept his argument for what went wrong
here, but let me praise him and the fine supporting cast for what was
right about the film, which was most of the film.</P>
