<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a hopelessly romantic film that traces in three parts the lives
of two children who fortuitously meet as eight year olds and feel
destined to each other for different reasons, who as teenagers consumate
their love, and when adults, they have been separated for a long time,
try desperately to find each other again. Their lives are compared to
how mythical and circular things are, and how one's fate is circular,
and how it is not fate alone but free will that determines what happens.</P>
<P>Two eight year olds attending nearby boys and girls schools, who both
happen to have palindromic names, Otto (Fele Martinez, Otto as an adult)
and Ana (Najwa Nimi, Ana as an adult), which is one of many coincidences
that Spain's influential film director, Julio Medem (The Red
Squirrel/Earth/Cows), uses to tell his dour love story about romantic
obsession and fate. The two children form a 17- year relationship from
their casual meeting over a soccer ball lost in the woods and from a
question posed on a paper airplane flown out of the school bathroom
window by Otto and retrieved in the adjacent schoolyard by Ana, who
says, "It is too lovely a question about love for any boy to have
written." The audience is not told what that question was, except that
one student says, as he recovers one of the many paper planes flown with
the same question written on it, "It's corny." Another student  says,
"It's embarrassing." In truth, those comments crossed my mind about many
aspects of this film, as I waivered about my feelings toward the story,
as spellbinding as the overall film was, because the story, in parts,
did feel "corny."</P>
<P>What's important about that unseen question, that Otto's father says is
the most important one in life and Ana's mother says how romantic it is,
is that it links the parents together, as they meet each other through
their children on the day Otto flew all those paper planes onto the
school grounds and when Otto's divorced father, Alvaro (Novo), is taking
Otto back home to his German mother from school. The parents hit it off
and become lovers driving the children home from school everyday from
now on and will soon get married, so that in a rapidly short period of
time the children go from being strangers, to being acquaintances, to
being brother and sister, and then to being secret teenage lovers.</P>
<P>The film can be told either backward or forward in time (which plays up
its palindrome theme), it starts from the plane crash at the end of the
film and it haphazardly veers back  from there to the beginning and
later portions of their lives, as the story is interpreted through the
eyes of either Ana or Otto, with sometimes different versions of the
same scene being told.</P>
<P>Medem makes a symbolic point about relating the children's lives to a
circle, where there is no real ending or beginning to their story. Otto
states that every life should include numerous circles and the Arctic
Circle becomes one of the symbolic physical circles used, as it becomes
the location where the frustrated 25-year-old lovers will meet for the
last time, after their real life seems to be going around in circles.
There are several other symbolic devices that are used by Medem a bit
more obtusely (like empty gas tanks), and one of those images might even
be considered prophetic, the repeated image shown of a car stopping
short of a collision with a red bus.</P>
<P>The solid story is befuddled with versions showing how the imagination
of the two differs from the supposed reality of the story, which should
leave the audience scratching their heads to try and figure out what is
actually happening. But the straight story goes something like this: Ana
interprets her first meeting with Otto in the woods to be an omen that
her father is trying to communicate with her, as she has just received
the news from her mother, Olga (Maru), that her father died in a car
crash. By believing that he is reincarnated as Otto and speaks to her
through him, she finds a satisfying sort of solace with her father's
death. Otto did not know what to make of this chance meeting with her
but was strongly attracted to her and felt they shared a true bond, and
that she will be a part of his destiny.</P>
<P>And destiny is one of the subtexts that Medem coyly toys with, as we
learn that Otto got his name from a German Nazi pilot who flew a bombing
mission over Guernica during the Spanish Civil War and crashed his plane
but was rescued by Otto's grandfather. Otto has from early on, had an
obsession with planes and will grow up to become a pilot and will
eventually meet that same pilot in Finland, who had married a Spanish
woman he met while trying to escape from Spain. When he meets the pilot,
his wife is already dead, as that is in tune with the theme of the film,
where a loved one either dies, is not found, or gets divorced. The story
stretches the coincidences to a point of incredibility and becomes more
tainted with its philosophical message than a typical romance film
usually is, as Medem carries out the argument that both reality and
fiction can be likened to a series of circles that interconnect through
the efforts of coincidences that may not make sense to our mortal eyes,
but these circles are present, in either physical places or in events
taking place in one's life.</P>
<P>Happiness does not last forever (nothing does according to Medem), and
into the couple's seemingly tranquil new marriage comes a major setback,
the stepmother cheats on Otto's father with no reason given except it is
implied that these things just happen, just like Alvaro left his wife
for no particular reason. The other man is not only also named Alvaro,
but he is the son of the German pilot Otto's grandfather rescued, and he
will marry Olga; and, Otto's father, who was madly in love with her,
will become a broken and lonely man as a result of the separation. The
teenage Otto, who was living with his German mother all this time, moves
out of her house to be with the only female he loves more than his
mother, as he now lives under the same roof with Ana. But this breaks
his mother's heart and she drops dead one day when she is cleaning
lettuce, presumably from a broken heart, and this has a traumatic effect
on him, as he feels guilty about leaving her and thereby abandons his
father's new family and goes off without telling anyone where he is.
There is one scene where Ana and him are in the same outdoor cafe in
Madrid, but fail to see each other, even though sitting at tables with
their backs next to each other, which outlines the course fate will take
for the two of them.</P>
<P>After her mother's new marriage to the other Alvaro, Ana becomes the
lover of someone she met in that Madrid cafe where the fated lovers did
not meet, Otto's elementary school teacher, and will live with him for
four-years. She also will become an elementary school teacher, as again,
things are shown to go around in circles. But she leaves her older
lover, pulled toward finding Otto again. And, she gets that chance after
another coincidence occurs. Her new stepfather hooks her up with his
father, who is the Otto that Otto was named after, and the former German
pilot will let her stay in a cabin he owns in Finland, where she will
await for her Otto to rescue her from her unhappiness. He is now a
mail-delivery pilot, seen doodling circles on his pilot's map while
circling around the Antarctic Circle, and is still pining for Ana, as he
suffers from his decision to be alone. His life seems to be damaged by
his misunderstandings and miscommunications, which have prevented him
from being with the one he loves.</P>
<P>As you might suspect by now, this film is not going to be clearly
resolved. Why should it be at this point, it has teased the audience
from the opening scene onward and there is no reason why the ending
shouldn't also be speculative.</P>
<P>Ana sends a letter to Otto's father, a letter that Otto actually
delivered himself without realizing it was from Ana, and he reads it
when he visits his lonely and aging father to cheer him up. In the
letter, is the same note that she sent to the teenage Otto, when she was
encouraging him to be her lover and climb through her bedroom window, by
stating: "Be brave!"</P>
<P>The film will end on two differing versions, one is labeled "Ana's Eyes"
and the other "Otto in Ana's Eyes." In the first version, there is a
happy ending, as Otto parachutes to safety on the grounds of Ana's
Arctic Circle cabin and just misses her, but finally comes into her arms
in the pilot's apartment and supposedly will find some renewed happiness
in his life. Though, even in this type of traditional Hollywood ending
that has pleased movie goers of romantic films for generations now, the
director has his doubts if there is any state of being that can be
permanent. In the second version, there is a sad ending, as Otto goes to
meet Ana and sees her crossing the street clutching a newspaper with a
picture of a downed plane, grief-stricken, thinking that Otto has died,
and she is hit by a red bus and dies. In the final shot, there is a
picture of Otto in her eyes. Which one is the true version probably
doesn't matter, as the director will allow you to believe whatever you
want to. If you are interested in my guess, it would be the later
version, the story seems to flow in that direction. Most people I know,
were put off by this slick ending, and question the filmmaker's real
intentions for playing with the audience like this. As for me, it wasn't
the ending that bothered me about this breathlessly beautiful film, with
its stunning shot of the midnight sun and of the Arctic wildlands, as
much as the story getting lost in trying to be too fanciful, playing
with my expectations for things to work out for these amenable lovers
and then not delivering any firm message but what seems to be at first
glance, only, a pretentiously philosophical one. And, by not staying on
target with the romantic part of the story, but drifting around in
circles, where the coincidences are just too much for any two people to
experience in a lifetime, the film becomes marginalized and makes it
seem like a philosophy exercise, albeit an absorbing one, but one that
is, nevertheless, less dramatic and more melodramatic than it should be.</P>
<P>But what I found strangely pleasant about the film, was that even though
I was somewhat put off by the tricks employed throughout the story, I
still found myself caught up in the dynamics of the characters and how
commonplace their lives were, that is, if you could discount all the
chance encounters. This made me realize that it didn't matter if this
film wasn't going to meet my expectations about what should be happening
or if its philosophy was overtly too oblique; the film had a special
quality about it that got its message across despite being off target.</P>
<P>The directors son, Peru Medem, Otto as a child, gave a dreamlike
performance as someone who is wrapped up in innocence and desire, which
is tearing at the fabric of his being, and he made the story come to
grips with what it was about or should have been about, the obsessive
love one has for someone, a love that is inexplicable and can't be
explained away by rationality or palindromes or reflections. Victor Hugo
Oliveira, as the teenage Otto, twisted up inside by the strange love
relationship he is going through, was delivering a sensitive
performance, as this relationship was intriguing, dangerously close to
being incestuous, but was one that was not clarified any further, to the
detriment of the film but to no fault of the actor. Therefore, the
startling ending to the film became less important to comprehend,
because the heart of the film wasn't explored as much as it should have
been. The strangeness of this film, is that its haunting use of language
and visuals to fill in the blanks for the characters, still overshadows
its melodramatic story and keeps the pot boiling, even when you might
think the film is skiing lumberingly uphill instead of gracefully
downhill and is about to slip and slide downhill in a crackup. But that
never happens because the film has a special elusive quality about it
that original films seem to always have.</P>
<P>Thusly, I felt caught up in the film's magical spell despite the many
reservations I had about the manipulations the director used, as he
ultimately proved that he has weaved a tale about the darkened lovers
and their near-misses and made it into a tale of haunting
characterizations, leaving something mysterious about this intangible
and intelligent film that held my undivided attention throughout.</P>
