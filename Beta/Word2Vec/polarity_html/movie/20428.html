<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A noir film that is noted for its brilliant character study of four of
its main participants: the psychopathic killer Eli Wallach (Dancer); his
older partner and mentor, Robert Keith (Julian); the dipsomaniacal
driver of the getaway car, Richard Jaeckel (Sandy McLain); and, the
cold-hearted boss of the heroin smuggling ring, the wheel-chair bound
boss, known as The Man (Vaughn Taylor).</P>
<P>The b/w film starts off fast-paced and never stops to catch its breath.
A porter throws some luggage in the back of a San Francisco cab, and the
cabbie panics upon seeing a cop and runs him over, but not before the
cop fires a shot killing him. The investigating officers, Lieutenant
Guthrie (Warner Anderson-he was in the TV series) and Inspector Quine
(Emile Meyer), question a Mr. Dressler (Bailey), who is a manager with
The San Francisco Opera House, after they find in his luggage a figurine
with a quarter of a kilo of heroin in it. They ascertain after initially
being suspicious of him that he is an innocent victim of a drug
smuggling operation that uses tourists unwittingly, by placing the drugs
in their luggage and then stealing back the contents after they clear
customs. The same porter who threw the luggage in the cab is soon found
by the police in the water, apparently dying from a hot shot (an
overdose of heroin). This comes about after there is an actual lineup in
the film, as all the ship's porters are brought in so that Dressler
could identify the one who threw his luggage in the cab. But since the
rather snooty Dressler was not observant of these lower-class types, he
was unable to pick the porter out of the lineup.</P>
<P>Into the picture enters Dancer and Julian, on a flight from Miami to San
Francisco,  casually discussing the use of the subjunctive tense, as the
older mentor tells him to use the term "If I were you, instead of, I was
you, it sounds better," and he then rhetorically comments, "how many
characters who hang out on street corners can say If I were you!" Julian
is trying his best to upgrade the volatile Dancer into becoming a
first-class hood, rather than just being a run-of-the mill psychopath.
One of the other peculiarities that Julian has, is that he likes to know
from Dancer the last words his victims say, just before he shoots them.
These two psychopaths are real beauties, and give the film the kind of
quirkiness that keeps its brutal scenes counterbalanced with a nice edge
of verbal nastiness.</P>
<P>Landing in S.F., their wheel man, Sandy McLain, meets them with his
souped-up rental car (rented with a stolen credit card) by their motel,
and the dialogue among the three is a real treat for fans of this genre.
Sandy asks them, How does it feel to earn $5,000 for one day of
work?"And, Julian responds, "Dancer derives no particular pleasure from
the money." As Sandy keeps yapping away and drinking whiskey from a
bottle, Julian empties the bottle, and tells him, "We prefer as little
conversation from outsiders as possible, Dancer works better that way."</P>
<P>Their work will be to retrieve three separate shipments of heroin
smuggled into S.F. from Hong Kong by three different voyagers on the
boat and get it to The Man by four-thirty P.M.. The boss is not known by
the hired thugs, who are curious about him, and question the driver
about him without getting any results.</P>
<P>The first shipment is willingly brought in by a merchant seaman
(Warner), who is not supposed to know what he is bringing in but finds
out and tries to extort more money from Dancer than his agreed upon
payment. Before Dancer kills him in the steamroom of the Merchants
Seaman's Hotel, he corrects the seaman's English when he says, I don't
like it when I can't see who I am talking to. He emphatically says, it
is WHOM. Warner's last words, duly noted for Julian's benefit are, "Why
be greedy?" This comes after asking for only a thousand dollars for his
silence. The second shipment came by way of an unsuspecting couple in
their silverware. When Dancer comes to their home and they are
unavailable, he tells the servant (Tang) that there was a mix-up of
luggage on the boat and requests to switch luggage, but the servant
becomes suspicious of him and refuses to give him the silverware case,
which turns out to be a mistake, as the maniacal Dancer kills him
without blinking an eye, as he is running up the stairs to tell his
employer. His last words are: Mr. Sanders! The final shipment was
brought in by a mother and a daughter, as the heroin is concealed inside
the girl's Japanese doll. They meet the two in an aquarium and Dancer
tries his charm out on the mother who is disapponted that the girl's
father did not meet them when the boat arrived; Dancer tells her no one
likes to travel alone and they go back to the hotel together, but things
go wrong when they find that the heroin packet is not inside the doll.
The girl found the powder and thought it was makeup, so she powdered the
doll's face. Instead of killing them, Julian talks Dancer into taking
them back to The Man to explain what happened to the drugs, this way
they won't have to worry if The Man thinks they ran off with his heroin
and has to put out a hit on them.</P>
<P>They arrive at an arcade called Sutro's Museum, but they don't realize
that an alert mounted horse policeman spotted their license plate, and
the police trail them here. Dancer goes to give The Man the heroin
shipments, but when he talks to him trying to explain what happened, The
Man tells him that he's dead, nobody sees my face and lives. Well,
Dancer takes one more humiliation from him, a slap in the kisser, then
he pushes the wheel chaired boss to his death down onto an ice skating
rink. The Man turns out to be a cruel reminder of the father-figure
symbol, which is supposed to explain why Dancer is so driven with hate.
Earlier in the film, Julian tells how Dancer is addicted with hate
because his father abandoned him.</P>
<P>The climax comes by way of a high speed chase, that ends when the wheel
man goes down the wrong highway and gets stuck where the highway is
under construction. When turning around to get back on the freeway,
Dancer kills the wheel man for his mistake, and when Julian starts
blaming him for getting them in this mess and goes to surrender to the
police, Dancer plugs his pal in the back but not before he says, "How
about some last words for the book?" He then takes the girl hostage, but
she frees herself from him and the police shoot Dancer, and the girl and
her mother are found to be safe, as the film ends just like it does as
if it were done on its own popular TV series, with everything tidied up.</P>
<P>This film is not noteworthy for its sadistic story, but what makes it
rise above the ordinary B movie, is the strangely provocative dialogue
and the utter depravity of all the criminals, who are shown in all their
ugliness and unredeeming features. It also makes good use of locales
such as the aquarium and ice skating rink and half-finished highway, and
it adds a feeling of desperation by using props such as the Japanese
doll, which is ravished by the psychopaths after they get by for a short
time having a normal conversation but must revert back to their violent
impulses when they can't get what they want. But what turns out to be
their downfall, is precipitated by the one-time they are unprofessional
and want to see who their boss is. The outcome shows that they can't
rise to another social level despite all their efforts to polish
Dancer's image.</P>
