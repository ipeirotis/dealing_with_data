<P>What do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the
legendary George Lucas, directed by virtuoso director Steven Spielberg, and
starring one of the biggest box-office stars in the world, Harrison Ford?
You get one hot-fudge-rockin' good time, that's what you get!!!</P>
<P>PLOT:
Professor/archeologist Indiana Jones sets out to find the long-lost mystical
Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it.
Adventures, snakes, romance and mucho action ensues.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Astounding movie packed with non-stop action, stunts galore, an interesting
story line, great one-liners, a solid cast, a catchy musical score, and all
the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride. If
you don't enjoy this film, then you just don't like action movies, period!
If you're young, you'll enjoy its humor, its cool action sequences and its
gross-out factor at times. If you're a little older, you'll appreciate the
interesting plot line, the romance, and yes, the mountains of adventure.
Watching this movie made me feel like a kid again, dreaming and fantasizing
about fighting the bad guys, travelling to different countries, making the
impossible, possible! Harrison Ford is perfect as the every-man with the
brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer, and Spielberg
manages to achieve the ideal balance of action, fun, adventure and humor.</P>
<P>Now if you really want to have a good time, check into this movie on the
same night as its two sequels, rent a jug of iced Coke, truckloads of nachos
and salsa, an adventure hat and whip, and prepare to gag yourself into a
world of action-movie heaven!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
This picture was nominated for eight 1981 Oscar nominations, including Best
Picture. It lost that award to CHARIOTS OF FIRE, but did manage to win for
Best Art Direction, Best Special Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Sound.
Actor Tom Selleck was originally cast as Indiana Jones, but was committed to
his hit TV show, "Magnum P.I.".
In filming the Well of Souls sequence, the producers scoured every pet shop
in London and the South of England for every snake they could lay their
hands on. Hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different
geographical areas. However, once all the snakes were on set, it became
clear that there were not nearly enough of them, so Spielberg had several
hoses cut into lengths, and these were used as well. Looking closely, you
can tell which are the real snakes and which are not.
An early draft of the script had Indy travelling to Shanghai to recover a
piece of the Staff of Ra. During his escape from the museum where it was
housed, he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong. Also
in the same script, Indy and Marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of
the Ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence. Both of these scenes were cut
from the script, but ended up in 1984's INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF
DOOM.
This film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of
the Paramount Pictures logo. The same type of opening is present in its
sequels.
Jock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number
"OB-CPO". This is a reference to Obi-Wan and C-3PO from George Lucas' STAR
WARS (9.5/10). Also, the hieroglyphics in the Well of Souls include
engravings of R2-D2 and C-3PO. They can be seen on a post to the right of
Indy and Sallah as they remove the Ark.
The script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and Indiana
with his whip. As legend has it, actor Harrison Ford was suffering diarrhea
at the time, and asked if the scene could be shortened. Spielberg said the
only way he could shorten it was if Indy pulled out his gun and just shot
the guy. The entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed.
When Indy first falls in the Well of Souls and is face to face with the
cobra, you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and
Harrison Ford, also some fingerprints and stuff like that.
When Indy is dragging along the ground, hanging onto the Nazi soldier's
truck with the Ark inside, you can see the pad that he's being dragged on.</P>
