<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A modern day Western adapted from Cormac McCarthy's National Book
Award-winning novel of 1992, which was accurately transferred to film by
Ted Tally's script, as it kept the same laconic cowboy dialogue from the
book intact, but was reduced considerably from the over three hour
length director Billy Bob Thornton originally shot it in, to under two
hours, the length the people from Miramax wanted it. It was hard to tell
if the film was missing anything because of this deletion, but I did
find the film to be directed with a skewed sense of rhythm. There were
also too many scenes that failed to go anywhere, making the film dull at
times. For a slow moving film, there was the contradiction of scenes
happening too fast to be developed and fully realized. As a result, "All
the Pretty Horses" failed to be engaging.</P>
<P>If the filmmaker was aiming for an epic, he sure didn't get it in this
sometimes elegaic film. What he got is something that plays more like a
slick magazine photo shoot on the travails of being a cowboy, or as a
touristy travelogue of what the Old West was like, or as a stylish film
that can't find what it wants to say and stumbles around in the grimness
of a prosaic story about youthful aspirations. What it lacked was some
emotional kick, as the scenes where the cowboys show off their spirited
exuberance, seemed more portentous than not and just didn't jive with
the unsure pace of the film.</P>
<P>What caught my attention in a positive way was how pretty the
picturesque vistas were and how the film gave off some good cowboy vibes
about friendship and loyalty and had some good cowboy lingo to go along
with all the pretty horses and with the hot-blooded senorita played by
Penélope Cruz.</P>
<P>The film opens in San Angelo, Texas, in 1949, where John Grady Cole's
(Matt Damon) grandfather has just died, leaving the big-spread ranch
John was born on to his remarried mother. She is divorced from John's
dad and he left the ranch in her hands because he screwed up, and to
John's bitter disappointment, she is selling the ranch to an oil company
because she has no interest in it or in him, but is interested in the
large sum of money she will receive. Since the young man's entire life
experience is ranching and his future has just gone up in a cloud of
dust, he feels he has no choice but to leave the area. He goes with his
loyal sidekick Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas) to Mexico to look for ranch
work, because that's where the pretty horses are and he can fulfill his
fantasy about being a real cowboy there.</P>
<P>It becomes an on-the-trail film, with a love story and a revenge story
filling in the life of the youthful cowboy drifters, as everything in
the film gets boiled down to a simplicity that is too simple-minded to
just accept without asking questions. The pardners motto is stated by
John Grady after they cross the Rio Grande and enter the foreign climate
of Mexico: He tells the 'doubting' Lacey "stick or quit."And,  he
further states. "How I was is how I am, and all I know is to stick." Now
that's some wicked cowboy talk 'pardner!'</P>
<P>The first danger sign for the two cowboys comes by way of meeting up
with a young kid on the trail, Jimmy Blevins (Lucas Black), who says he
is 16 and is running away from his mean stepfather and in whom they
sense trouble. He is riding a horse the cowboys think is too good for
him and surmise he stole it from his stepfather. I found him to be the
most interesting one in the film, as he adds his childish stubborness,
volatility, homespun humor, tough backbone for fair play, silly
superstitions about thunder and brings with him the hard-luck of someone
who never had a chance in this world, giving this complacent film,
seemingly so self-satisfied with its boring self, a chance to become
energized by his maverick portrayal. When Blevens is onscreen, the
shallowness of the story doesn't seem to matter, because his
coming-of-age story is better than John Grady's.</P>
<P>The kid somehow loses his pretty horse and gun, his two most valuable
possessions and winds up taking back his horse and later taking back by
force his gun from the Mexican who won't give it up so easily, and
thereby the kid winds up in a Mexican jail for murder. When he's out of
the picture, the story starts to drag. the film then turns its attention
to Matt Damon's coming-of-age story, as he and Lacey rode away from
Blevins after he got back his horse, realizing the kid is wreckless and
could take them down with him. They ride aimlessly into Mexico until
they land jobs as ranch hands. John Grady becomes a wild mustang tamer
and a lover of the sexy Alejandra (Penelope Cruz), the daughter of the
wealthy Mexican rancher (Blades) and horse breeder he works for, someone
with whom he forms an awkward father-son relationship with, as he
counsels the ranch owner on what horses to breed (the irony being that
the rancher accepts what he says about horses, but rejects him for his
daughter).</P>
<P>Mexico becomes for John Grady a place of adventure and romance, but the
romance never set off any sparks between him and Cruz, even as its love
at first sight, as they scope each other out, and though the two keep
telling each other how much they are in love, yet, in this case, seeing
is believing...and I'm not believing what I can't see.</P>
<P>The story then plays like a routine melodrama, of the aristocratic
father and the protective aunt (Miriam Colon), working to break up the
romance to protect the girl's honor. Of the law coming after the two
cowboys for being with Blevins, after the aunt and the ranch owner rat
them out to the authorities. Of them being confined unfairly in a
corrupt Mexican jail and being abused by the cruel police captain
(Mechoso), who tortures Blevins before taking him out to be shot, and of
their transfer to a slovenly penitentiary, which held some of the most
unbelievable scenes yet, where John Grady gets into a staged knife fight
in the mess hall with a convict, and there isn't a single prison guard
in sight, if you can believe that.</P>
<P>There might have been a good picture in this tale, but it just never
kicked in. Everything about the film felt choppy and not certain of the
direction it was going in. The star-crossed lovers had no depth or sense
of urgency in their lustful romance, and the film spent so much time
trying to tie up all the loose-ends about the romance, and yet it had
nothing much to say about it, as it always seemed hollow. The revenge
tale of going after the Mexican lawman who did them wrong, was also
thinly played out and had no teeth in its emotional outbursts. Though
the buddy story was well-played between Damon and Thomas, as Damon
showed that he could be expressive and wear his changing feelings in a
credible way. His problem was, even though he could physically do the
cowboy role, I was never convinced that he actually was one. But the
most disheartening thing about this film, was how out of whack it
seemed, as the story had no staying power, it kept going off the trail,
until it looked more like a Marlboro billboard commercial than an
enriching story of two decent young men living out their dream to be
cowboys. Something must have gotten lost in adapting the book to film,
because I couldn't find where the heartfelt story was in all the
superficiality I was surrounded by. The real star of this film was the
landscape, I couldn't take my eyes off it. I think Penélope Cruz can act
(at least she can in an Almodovar film), but in this film she's around
only as part of the beautiful scenery. I know Matt Damon can act and he
shows in this film that he can let us look inside him, but I don't think
he was up to being the romantic lead needed to make this film come
alive. Overall the film lacked a psychological breath to get us more
involved in the characters. The filmmaker only accomplished showing us
simple things, things we already knew, like Mexico's justice system is
corrupt while in Texas the judicial system is fair (Ummm!). After his
harrowing experience in Mexico, which left him scarred, Matt Damon feels
so comfortable with the Texas judicial system, that he has a
heart-to-heart talk with a kind-hearted judge (Dern). After seeing that,
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</P>
