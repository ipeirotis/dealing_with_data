<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>An action-packed sleazy crime drama that pits a sadistic crime lord, Mr. Brown
(Conte), against a police lieutenant, Leonard Diamond (Wilde), who is obsessed
to smash Brown's crime syndicate. This film noir features a perverse sexual
relationship between gangster Brown and a thrill-seeking society girl, Susan
Lowell (Wallace), who stays with him for four years even though he treats her as
a possession and she knows he's a ruthless killer. She can't leave him, as he
knows what buttons to push to make her body quake for him. There is a sense of
doom that all the main characters share, as they also share a sense of mixing
violence with sex. There are no healthy relationships shown, as the good guy cop
is fighting his dark repressions inside as well as the dark world of the
gangsters. John Alton's photography, in a stark black and white tint, helps
explore this ominous dark world of dangerous alleys and stylish penthouses. </P>
<P>Unable to get out of the deadly relationship with Mob financier Brown, as he has
her followed everywhere by hitmen Fante (Van Cleef) and Mingo (Holliman), she
tries to commit suicide by taking too many pills. When unconscious in the
hospital, Susan called out the name Alicia. This is the lead that Diamond has
been waiting for to nail Brown, as he tries to convince his superior, Captain
Peterson (Middleton), to keep him on the case. The captain is finding it
difficult to justify the expenses of investigating suspected Mob boss Mr. Brown
for such a long time without any results. As a desperate measure Diamond arrests
Brown and over ninety of his gang members, as he only asks them who Alicia is.
Diamond is rewarded for his effort by getting the name Bettini (de Corsia) from
Brown's lie detector test. Bettini, when tracked down and expecting to die by
one of Brown's contract killers, will tell Diamond that Alicia was Brown's wife.</P>
<P>But Diamond gets the ire of Brown after all those arrests, and he gets Fante and
Mingo to bring the meddlesome cop to a dark room where he tortures him. They use
the hearing aid of second banana hood McClure (Donlevy), to bring up the volume
beyond tolerant levels. </P>
<P>When they are finished with the cop, they pour hair tonic down his throat so
that he appears drunk and they dump him on the doorstep of Captain Peterson.
This torture session only makes Diamond more obsessed with getting Brown, as he
follows up the lead Bettini gives him and sees the former skipper, a Swede
called Dreyer (Hoyt), of the boat that Alicia, Grazzi, and Brown chartered when
they were last seen. Dreyer now owns an antique shop thanks to Brown. </P>
<P>Thinking Alicia was killed, Diamond soon learns through the help of Susan that
Alicia is alive. By decifering the clues in the recent photo of Alicia that
Susan gives him, as she steals it from Brown's vault, he figures out she's in a
private sanitarium. He also figures out that it was Grazzi who was killed on
that boat and not Alicia, and he now goes after Brown with a renewed vigor. </P>
<P>But McClure also knows that Grazzi is dead and that Diamond knows this. He is
jealous that Brown heads the syndicate instead of him and sees his big chance to
head the syndicate by getting the hitmen to go along with him and double-cross
the boss. Instead, he's killed by them. As an odd touch to his execution, Brown
out of mock compassion removes his hearing aid so he won't hear the bullets. </P>
<P>Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph. </P>
<P>At last, Diamond gets Alicia to spill the beans about Brown killing his crime
boss and dumping his body overboard, and of his placing her in the insane asylum
to shut her up. When he tries to escape, Diamond traps him inside an airplane
hangar as Susan shines the high beam lights on him. </P>
<P>Lewis has created a nasty film noir, where all the characters are sullied by
their peculiar sexual habits. The sadistic hitmen Fante and Mingo, give all
indications that they are in a fatalistic homosexual relationship that is
heightened by their need for violence as a stimulant. The hero, Diamond, seems
to be so compulsively motivated by his strong actions against Brown, because
he's repressed and is secretly envious of Brown for attracting such a desirable
woman. While Brown is a classical Freudian example of a nobody who dominates
others by keeping them down. He's a former prison guard, who hides behind his
insecurities by using his blinding hatred and insatiable sex drive and
controlling nature to keep others in their place. His thing is to make everyone
call him Mr. Brown and look up to him. He insults the cop by saying he gets the
same wages as a busboy in one of the hotels he owns. </P>
<P>Conte is convincing as the maniacal hood, while Wilde is a good counter-balance
to Conte. He stylishly plays his persistent cop role with a sense of reckless
grit, as each becomes the other's alter ego. The film was raw, a visually
unblemished drama about violence and pain. </P>
