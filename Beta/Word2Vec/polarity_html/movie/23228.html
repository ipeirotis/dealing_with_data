<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A claustrophobic tale of an elderly mother, her son, a nurse, a lodger,
and the nurse's boyfriend living in the same apartment, in the Hungary
of the early '80s, when there was a housing shortage. Bela Tarr, who is
in his early 40s, is a prominent figure in the Hungarian film movement,
much influenced by John Cassavettes and Andrei Tarkovsky. In his brief
film career, he has just made six films, including the critically
acclaimed DAMNATION and SATANTANGO. His films are noted for not being
linear narratives and for examining people who are in a state of moral
decay. He is most interested in relationships and how people survive and
to find out what is real and what is illusionary amidst the corrupting
system they live in.</P>
<P>The film opens with a quote from Pushkin, "Even if you kill me, there
will be no trace of me, only the devil will be going round and round in
circles."</P>
<P>The content of his film usually overrides its style, at times he seems
to care very little how his film looks. This film is a minor
transformation for him, there is some effort to make the film seem more
stylish.This is accomplished with his camera capturing some unique
footage of underground shots of an argument in progress, as he amazingly
views his subjects in a way they never expected to be seen.</P>
<P>The plot revolves around the occupants of a large apartment, desperately
trying to relate with each other: fighting over financial matters,
trying to establish their sovereignty, revealing their fears and their
loneliness, grasping for love, and all the while clinging to each other
and hating themselves for it. To say that this a harsh tale, is to
really note how bleak their lives are, how grim the large apartment is,
and how unsatisfying is their love life and everything around them.</P>
<P>The mother is the central figure of the story, she has the money and
owns the apartment, and as the poet, William Blake, says, "The devil
holds the moneybag." Her son is confused, full of hate for his mother
and self-hate for himself. He threatens to kill her in one of their
arguments. All indications point to these arguments taking place over a
long period of time. He is a drunkard, in his early- 30s, unable to hold
onto a regular job, surviving on his mother's coattails. She doesn't
fail to mention this to him, irritating him even further.Their
conversations are so tense, there seems to be no hope for them.</P>
<P>The nurse is a conniving temptress and slut, feigning concern for the
old lady, but really using her as she uses everyone else she comes into
contact with, interested solely in her own pleasures.The confrontation
between her and the old lady makes for powerful drama, as each is
possessed with a determined and warped will; each with a need for
supremacy over the other.</P>
<P>The lodger is a pathetic figure; an old drunken man, in deep financial
trouble, reduced to being a thief; thereby, even discarding the only
thing he has left that is honorable: his reputation as a once upstanding
teacher.The nurse's boyfriend is a user of people, a hostile person with
no direction to his life and no love in him. All these characters are
emotionally distraught, suffering from jangled nerves and loneliness.</P>
<P>Tarr's camera is everywhere: under them, over them, close-up, and
panning the room. His choice of garish colors for the grim apartment is
curious and provoking. This is a tough film to watch, but if you want to
see something introspective, something that has a rawness to it that is
uncompromising, then this existential-like film fits the bill. It
generates an uncomfortable and uncompromising tension that is very
perceptive about the human condition. Above all, its message is, you
must love someone, which is easier said, than done.The filmmaker subtly
asks the question, of all his characters, what is it that you believe
in?</P>
