<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This gimmicky experimental film from Mike Figgis ("Leaving Las Vegas")
isn't worth the film its on...even if one were to applaud the effort.
Will pretentious crap do for a succinct review of the film! It is more
of a joke than a serious film, as all it tries to do is push the
boundaries of technical innovation, while it neglects the basics of
movie making: character development and the telling of a good story.
Shot on digital video in real time, with four hand-held cameras filming
four different split screens, allowing the viewer to pick his poison as
to which screen to watch, the narrative is told without any cuts,
therefore no editor is needed. One of the screens has a louder volume,
indicating that is the one the director thinks we might be more
interested in watching.</P>
<P>This soap opera story is about the lives and loves of sundry people
connected to a Hollywood production company, as they cast for their
latest film project, which it turns out, is similar to the film just
seen.</P>
<P>Ana Pauls (Mia Maestro), a heavily, foreign accented avant-garde
filmmaker, pitches her project at the office of Red Mullet Productions
to a roomful of uptight executives. Her preachy lecture is accompanied
by the hip-hop music of her boyfriend (Alessandro Nivola), while at her
side is her wormy agent (Kyle MacLachlan), as she drops names -- from
Sergei Eisenstein to Walter Gropius -- using embellishments to overstate
her case, as freely as Al Gore does. Ana expounds on the virtue of art
and technology "to go beyond the paradigm of collage." This is greeted
by a burst of laughter from the studio producer Alex (Stellan
Skarsgard), as he can't imagine this as a serious work. Well, at least,
there should be something said about honesty in recognizing the worth of
the product produced. The filmmaker's attempt here, is to make a
stinging satire on Hollywood and himself.</P>
<P>Timecode, under the pretense of being innovative, gets a big studio to
take a chance on producing it, which doesn't mean it's worthwhile. The
film was most like one of those stationary camcorder sites that they
have on the Internet, of say, some street corner, where the viewer hopes
the time he spends is not wasted and something spontaneous will unfold
to make it worth his while.</P>
<P>The prosaic story opens with a therapy session involving Emma (Saffron
Burrows),
describing her marital crisis to her unfaithful husband Alex, who is
burnt-out from being a drug addict and an alcoholic. The haggard
producer keeps busy by having several affairs, but an affair with an
aspiring, voluptuous actress Rose (Salma Hayek), is the key one to the
story. Rose's jealous lesbian lover Lauren (Jeanne Tripplehorn) suspects
this affair, and plants a microphone on Rose while they ride to her
audition in Lauren's limo. Lauren wishes to confirm what she already
knows and when confirmed will commit a bloody deed in this very ragtag
presentation of romantic problems, with the lesbian, naturally, being
made the ultimate villain.</P>
<P>At various times, the obvious symbolism of an earthquake is used as an
artificial means to shake up all the characters in the quadrant. It was
awkwardly done, seemingly ruining whatever natural effect was aimed for
in telling this story in real time.</P>
<P>I just couldn't get interested in this experimental film, finding it
dizzying to watch and I was also hampered by its lack of wit and lack of
spontaneous outrageousness. These are the type of films the Warhol
factory used to knock out with clockwork, able to easily get the right
freaks to pull off their bizarre free-flowing sordid tales, as they did
in " The Chelsea Girls." "Timecode" just couldn't translate its sense of
fun to the viewer, at least it couldn't to me. As for the technical
feats attempted, maybe a more innovative filmmaker could make something
of this format that wasn't done right here. Other than that, this plays
mostly as a novelty film, one to see because it's part of movie history.</P>
