<P>     It has been too long since we have seen Gena Rowlands on screen, but
it takes only a few minutes of UNHOOK THE STARS to recall how good she can
be.  Rowlands plays Mildred Hawkes, a widow and career housewife whom we
meet delivering newspapers during the extended shot which plays beneath
the opening credits.  The route, we learn, belongs to her sullen and
rebellious daughter Annie (Moira Kelly), and Mildred mutters to herself as
she delivers the papers that this will be the last time she covers for
Annie.  We know instantly, of course, that this isn't true.  Mildred's
life is organized around doing things for others, and even when Annie
moves out of the house in an act of defiance Mildred continues the paper
route because it is something to give structure to her day.  She is a
woman living in an empty nest who almost doesn't know how to be anything
but a wife or a mother.</P>
<P>     Mothers tend to get very shabby treatment in the movies, portrayed as
perpetual nags or otherwise treated as comic relief, but Rowlands'
performance as Mildred is beautifully balanced and convincing.  If UNHOOK
THE STARS had focused entirely on Mildred, it might have been a great
film.  Instead, director and co-writer Nick Cassavetes (Rowlands' son with
the late director John Cassavetes) splits his story between two
characters:  Mildred, and her foul-mouthed, troubled neighbor Monica
Warren (Marisa Tomei).  Early in the film, Monica kicks out her abusive
husband (David Thornton), and asks Mildred -- whom she had never met
before -- to watch her 6-year-old son J. J. (Jake Lloyd) while she works
split shifts as a waitress.  Mildred is only too happy to have another
child to teach, and watching the relationship between the two is an
absolute delight as Mildred dusts off her somewhat old-fashioned parenting
methods and begins to feel useful again.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, UNHOOK THE STARS gets side-tracked whenever Tomei's
Monica is the center of attention.  In a film which is otherwise low-key
and observant, Tomei starts to crank up the adorable loud-mouth routine to
MY COUSIN VINNY levels.  A scene in which Monica is a guest for
Thanksgiving dinner -- much to the consternation of Mildred's
straight-laced son Ethan (David Sherrill) -- plays like something from a
much broader fish-out-of-water comedy, and drags on for an awfully long
time.  Tomei's performance isn't a bad one; it's just a good one in a
different kind of movie.  Her character exists mostly to provide the
laughs, and whether or not Monica and her estranged husband reconcile is
only interesting because it affects Mildred.  Cassavetes makes the mistake
of treating that issue as one in which we have an equal emotional
investment.</P>
<P>     There is a similar awkwardness to a sub-plot which finds Mildred in a
romantic flirtation with one of Monica's drinking buddies, a
French-Canadian truck driver named Big Tommy (Gerard Depardieu).  Big
Tommy's passes are rather absurd, and not simply because Mildred is a much
older woman.  Those scenes mark the only occasions where Mildred is
treated as slightly pathetic, a lonely old lady getting drunk and finding
the attentions of a younger man equally intoxicating.  That romance
ultimately has little to do with Mildred's development through UNHOOK THE
STARS, but Cassavetes doesn't quite seem to realize what a great character
he has in Mildred, and what a unique arc her story takes without the
distractions of a wacky neighbor or a romantic interest.</P>
<P>     That is more of a testimony to how good UNHOOK THE STARS is when
Rowlands is center stage than it is to a lack of quality the rest of the
time.  The script takes Mildred on a subtle but intriguing side-track when
Ethan and his wife invite her to move with them to San Francisco, an
invitation which Mildred declines.  She believes that her choice is an
example of her willingness at last to let go of her children, but it is
only because she has J. J. to take care of that she feels prepared to do
so.  When that relationship appears to be pulled out from under her as
well, Mildred is forced to acknowledge that she has merely substituted a
new person whose happiness is more important to her than her own.
Rowlands is sensational as she tries to cope with a life strictly for
herself, and UNHOOK THE STARS is a beautiful character study when we are
allowed to watch.  You only wish you could have watched without the
supporting characters jumping up and obscuring your view quite so often.</P>
