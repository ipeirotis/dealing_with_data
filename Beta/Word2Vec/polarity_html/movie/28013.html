<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A sci-fi film, originally started as a student project, noted only for
its great special effects, as created by Dennis Muren. He raised $30,000
with the help of friends and took about 4 years to make this film. In
order to get it released, he sold it to producer Jack H. Harris, who
shot some scenes over again and released it in 1971. Muren now does the
special effects for George Lucas on his Star War films and won an Oscar
for his work. This film is a good example of his first effort doing
special effects in a feature film.</P>
<P>The problem with this film -- that came 30 years before Blair Witch
Project and has its same scary themes played out in the woods by
students -- is its amateur acting, shoddy production values, horrible
script, and ridiculous story. The acting is so flat and awkward, that
the film never seemed professional, even though it was reworked for
theatrical release. It has, nevertheless, over the years, become a cult
favorite on video (where it is titled "The Beast"). It could be
appreciated by some horror film buffs despite all its shortcomings and
genre clichés for its crudeness. There are just some people who love bad
films.</P>
<P>The film opens with a young man in the woods, Dave (Edward Connell),
calling for
"Susan (Barbara Hewitt)" and then running out of the woods in fright and
onto the highway, where he tries to flag down a car driven by itself,
which runs him over but another car with people in it immediately comes
along and takes him to the hospital. That accident happened one year and
one day ago and now a reporter comes to the mental hospital where Dave
is in a sulken depressive state, clutching onto a small cross on a
chain. It's a slow news day, so the reporter thinks he might come up
with a story about the bizarre tragedy that hit the news exactly one
year ago, as the doctor currently treating Dave allows for the visit.
Dave is quiet until the reporter shows him a picture of an older man, Dr
Waterman (Fritz Leiber-in real life a science fiction novelist), thereby
Dave attacks him, ending the interview, though in the attack the
reporter comes into possession of the cross, turning it over to the
doctor. The doctor then plays for the reporter a tape recording Dave
made on the day he was brought to the hospital after being hit by the
car.</P>
<P>The film is one long flashback of Dave's recollections, as he seems to
be also recollecting things he wasn't even involved with. Don't ask me
how he can do that!</P>
<P>Dr. Waterman is Dave's geology professor and urgently invites him to his
mountain retreat to discuss an important discovery. Dave decides to make
this visit a picnic by inviting some airhead young friends along with
him: Jim (Frank Bonner) and his girlfriend Vicki (Robin Christopher),
she brings along her friend Susan (Barbara Hewitt) as a blind date for
Dave. They seem to be lost and are not sure if they are on the right
road, but when they leave their car on the impassable road and walk to
Dr. Waterman's cabin, they find it caved in and unlivable. A park ranger
happens by on horseback and tells them his name is Asmodeus (Jack
Woods), and that Dr. Waterman is probably back in town.</P>
<P>Vicki sees a castle on a nearby cliff.  Dave suggests, maybe that's
where Waterman is and so they decide to go there. On the way, they hear
a madman laughing from a cave and find nearby gigantic footprints made
by a beast. The intrepid but foolish youngsters light some torches and
go into the cave, where a cackling Old Man forces a large tome on them
which is locked. "The Book," which is old and smells of sulphur,
contains satanic symbols and a note from Dr. Waterman about good and
evil living together, and how this Book is a Bible of Evil, over a
thousand years old and comes from the Persian Gulf. It is translated
into many languages, which made it difficult for the professor to
decifer all of it, but he did create some beasts from the Book's
symbols, but is disappointed that his experiment was a failure, as he
couldn't control these mutant-beasts (in flashback we see one of them
destroying his cabin). In the spirit of ecumenical tolerance, the Book
has remedies against evil--that a cross or a Star of David or numerous
other symbols would ward off the evil spirits. Jim, in between bites on
his picnic chicken, says this is pretty heavy stuff.</P>
<P>Hey, Jim! what comes next is more than heavy, as Dr. Waterman steals the
Book and while running away is chased by the boys and falls by a shallow
stream and dies. When the boys don't come back, Vicki leaves Susan alone
and goes to round up the boys. The boys are baffled that the dead body
of Waterman disappears, as Asmodeus appears on the scene, questioning
the boys, then putting a special oversized ring on his finger, as he
makes his face go contorted and puts Susan in a trance as he attacks
her. But the cross she wears around her neck saves her, as he backs off
from that powerful symbol and when she awakens, only remembers that she
was attacked, but not recalling who did it. Dave realizes that the cross
saved her, so the others make symbols out of willow twigs to wear on
them, which they copy from the Book.</P>
<P>The remainder of the film is a testimony to the special effects created
on such a limited budget, but the story can only be constued as
ridiculous, as the four young students who must have taken stupid pills
to still be hanging around in the woods, continue on with their
adventure.</P>
<P>What pops up next, is a huge, animated, mutant-gorilla who is chasing
the Old Man around and frightening the girls, as the guys are heading
for the castle atop the mountain, seemingly not concerned about leaving
the girls behind. But the castle has mysteriously vanished. Upon hearing
the girls screaming, the boys return to stop the monster from stealing
the Book and Dave will make a wooden spear to kill the monster.</P>
<P>Asmodeus will show his true face to Jim and make him an offer for the
Book, offering to conjure up anything  in the world he wants for it,
which sounds like a fair trade, if you ask me. But Dave wants to keep
the Book to learn the secrets to cure Susan of the evil she was infected
with. With that, Asmodeus promises that none of them will get out of the
woods alive--even if they hold up a symbol that could deter him.</P>
<P>Then a huge mutant ogre attacks the Book carrying Jim and chases him
into an invisible zone, but he gives the Book to Dave who passes it onto
the girls and tells them to go back to the car and wait for him, while
he goes into the invisible zone to rescue Jim.</P>
<P>Dave is the only one who manages to escape from the flying mutant-bats
and other mutant creatures attacking them, but he is told by a
mutant-hooded figure that he will die within one year and one day.</P>
<P>The film ends in a question mark, as Dave is left in a straight jacket,
yelling for his cross, as the insensitive and dull reporter leaves the
mental hospital saying there's no story here, and the dumb doctor must
also be deaf, because he doesn't give poor Dave his cross back, and
Susan, who is apparently still alive, looking slightly contorted while
wolfishly smiling before she even gets into the evil mood, is seen
heading to the hospital's front door.</P>
