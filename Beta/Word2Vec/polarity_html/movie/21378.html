<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Bringing Out The Dead, in one sense, is a love/hate black comedy about
the relationship the director Martin Scorsese has with his home turf of
NYC in the early 1990s and, in the other sense, it is a psychological
study about those who are trying to save the sick in a dying city when
they can't be sure if they can even save themselves. Frank Pierce (Cage)
is a burnt out paramedic who has gone on one too many missions of mercy,
thinking that he needs just one last save to regain his equilibrium. He
now sees the ghosts of those he couldn't save everywhere he looks. The
conflict inside him revolves around the tremendous high he gets over
saving a life- there is no better feeling, he tells us in a voiceover,
his usual way of conveying to the viewer what he is thinking- and the
low point is from all the depravity and hopelessness and horror he sees
all around him everyday.</P>
<P>His ambulance route is in the neighborhood of his birth, Hell's Kitchen,
though his family moved upstate when he was of high school age, as so
many others have previously done to remove themselves from the besetment
of drugs and despair and crime that has taken over the streets in that
once mostly Irish enclave.</P>
<P>His ambulance buzzes past the unnatural everyday sights of the city: of
hookers working the streets (one of them who is pregnant), children drug
dealers, the homeless, smelly drunks, and a frightening look at how the
have-nots live in a city of morbid neon lights and graffiti hi-riser
buildings. These images become a reminder of what hell might look like.</P>
<P>There is the ghost of one patient that Frank lost recently, a young
homeless woman named Rose, that he keeps seeing over and over again,
causing him to be severely depressed, to suffer from insomnia, to not
eat properly, and to hit the bottle. That he is stressed out, should
come as no surprise, his job might very well be the most stressful one
in the city. So who could blame him if he reports late to work and uses
up all his sick days and can't get fired even though he wants to, all
because the city needs his body out there, and his downfall is not that
uncommon for a job like his, anyway.</P>
<P>Scorsese emphasizes how tormenting this job is, by following the
ambulance driver around for three painful night shifts through the
glittering lights of Manhattan, each night Frank is with a different
partner and with each, there is a different outlook on the job
exhibited. That in a nutshell is the plot of the film, as this is a
story mostly about character development and the unique personalities of
those who choose to work under such trying conditions, and of the
uncertain relationship that develops between two kindred spirits, Mary
and Frank. The audience is taken along for the grim ride and the
entertainment comes from the constant gallows humor of these very
obsessively comedic EMS men, who provide the necessary breaks in the
story for everyone concerned, that is audience and driver alike. Things
are so insane that if you don't laugh, you can succumb to the intensity
of the situation by just watching it. How insane the situation is, is
highlighted from the first radio dispatch heard in the background, where
the call is to help a woman in distress because a roach crawled in her
ear. This is a dark comedy in the real sense of being dark, with the
noir style to the film provided by Scorsese's frequent screenwriter,
Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver/Raging Bull/The Last Temptation of Christ).</P>
<P>The hospital that is on his route, a place of bedlam and futility, is
named Our Lady of Perpetual Mercy, but called by the EMS personnel,
"Misery," and for good reason. This is a place where there aren't enough
beds to handle all the victims from gunshots and heart attacks and bad
drug trips. The doctors work relentlessly on double shifts, and the
atmosphere is frighteningly horrific, with wild screams, patients tied
to their beds so that they wouldn't go on a rampage, and utter chaos in
the lobby, where security guards menacingly try to keep order.</P>
<P>The first call that Frank goes out on, is with Larry (Goodman), his
chatty and obese partner, enamored by fast-food places and concerned
about not eating the same meal twice in one week, who is planning to
soon be in the suburbs running his own private ambulance service.</P>
<P>They respond to a heart attack victim in a walk-up tenement building,
where the victim has been dead for a few minutes and the family is
bewilderedly huddled around their patriarch, hoping for a miracle.
Frank, who is considered to be the best at saving lives, has been
working as a paramedic for the past five years. This could be the rescue
he needs, as he desperately tries to save the old man's life by giving
him CPR and shocks to the heart in order to bring back his patient from
the dead. As a last resort, he puts on a Sinatra album the old man
liked. This seems to give the patient a pulse and the family some hope.
The patient's anxious daughter, the former junkie, Mary Burke (Patricia
Arquette), who is the actual wife of Cage, forms a bond of friendship
instantly with Frank, who will act as a liaison for her to pass on
information about her father from the hospital. They will meet together
for the next three nights in the chaos of the hospital where her father
is just one of many emergencies handled during the night's graveyard
shift, and their ambiguous relationship will center around the reports
Frank gives her on the condition of her father.</P>
<P>Frank feels Mary's pain and wants her love or approval; he desperately
is in need of a woman to comfort him, just like she needs his moral
support-- he looks like a priest to her. We know very little about
Frank's personal life except what little he tells us in the voiceover
about his divorce, but he doesn't tell us why his wife left him, nor do
we see where he lives, or who his friends are, or what his interests are
other than the job, which seems to be his whole life. The few times we
see him out of uniform in civilian clothes, he looks ordinary. In
uniform he looks like a God.</P>
<P>His second partner is the hilarious loud-mouth, Marcus (Ving Rhames),
who is a mixture of playboy, gin drinking rogue and Jesus fanatic, with
a devastating sense of humor. Marcus' hope is that God will see to it
that he gets through the night. Their night out results in them treating
a drug overdosed punk rocker who took a deadly new drug on the scene
called "red poison," and of Marcus speeding recklessly to another call,
which results in the ambulance overturning, leaving them both with minor
injuries and lots of nervous laughter over their narrow escape from
death.</P>
<P>The partners seem to be getting more intense with each night shift, as
the third driver, Tom (Sizemore) points out, that the full moon is out
and it is Saturday, as he gleefully rubs his hands together expecting
plenty of action. Tom is the forceful type; he likes to take matters
into his own hands. On his shift the two most memorable things that
happen are a drug shootout in an apartment building, where one victim is
dying from gunshot wounds and the other is impaled on the terrace gate
(Cliff Curtis), as he jumped from the 16th floor to the 14th to escape
his fate. As a coincidence, he gave Frank some kind of a stress
relieving pill the previous night, which Frank took in a moment of
weakness and desperation, as he followed Mary to this drug pad,
concerned that she couldn't handle the strain any longer of learning
about her father's death, especially when she wasn't able to put a
closure on their stormy relationship by having one last chance to talk
to him (she hasn't even seen her father for the last three years due to
an argument). Her father is someone that Frank actually saved and the
hospital might have been able to keep him alive, but Frank thought he
heard the man's voice telling him he didn't want to live anymore, and so
he failed to give him the necessary shocks to keep him alive. The other
major incident on this shift, was the violent reaction of Tom to the
deranged Noel (Marc Anthony), who is completely wasted on drugs and is
known to the paramedics as a very troubled man. He should have been
placed in a mental institution if this was a civilized city, but who now
wanders the street taking a baseball bat and knocking out car windows
with it. Tom's way of handling him, is to teach him a lesson with a
beating, while Frank's approach is to identify with his insanity and try
to communicate as best he can with him.</P>
<P>It becomes apparent that Frank is going bonkers, while the other drivers
are handling the job much better than he is: they are getting by (Larry
by dreaming of better days to come, Marcus by finding God, and Tom by
taking things into his own hands). It is just Frank who is falling
completely apart, thinking he must save someone in order for him to be
redeemed. He is especially upset because over the last few months
everyone seems to be dying on him. Mary now becomes his only hope. He
must either save her from becoming an addict again or she must save him
from his ghost-like existence. Mary is likened in his eyes to the Virgin
Mary, as the kind of relationship that forms between the two is a
difficult one to apprehend, as they are both caught by their own demons
and are so afraid of love and of not being loved, and they are afraid
that the tenderness they have for others might drain them and leave them
without enough energy for them to save themselves. This all leads up to
the film's final shot, where he becomes like the son in a religious
painting of Christ, resting after a long journey in the arms of the holy
mother, cuddled up next to her in the bright whiteness of a spiritual
light. Could that be his salvation, a spiritual one, the only hope there
is for Frank?</P>
<P>By the time the third night shift ends, the audience is strained and
left overwhelmed by all the noise from the city streets, the background
rock music, the depravity of the hospital, the constant frenetic chatter
of the paramedics, and the need for them to have some artificial way to
get by their shift. Frank's way is through coffee, whiskey, vitamin
shots, and living with ghosts-- and none of them work. This film is
intense all right, and it drags on for much too long a look at the
insane world it envisions, making its way through a grotesque looking
city and a hospital that is likened to a crazy house.</P>
<P>The misery uncovered is catching, like certain diseases are. But is it
worth it? Does the film have something salient to say, as Scorsese seems
more comfortable in these surroundings than he did in the foreign turf
of The Age of Innocence and Kundun, for instance? Is there entertainment
value in this story? That I really don't know, but I do know that it all
seemed too real and that the acting was superb, one couldn't help but
get entangled in the lives of the characters, and there was a rush of
adrenaline emanating from the highs and even the lows experienced. The
Nicolas Cage performance caught the nuances of his character in a
bewitching manner, as in his crazed EMS role, he catches the futility
and desperation he feels gnawing at him from inside and displays an
engaging chemistry with the three drivers and with Patricia Arquette.
Though, her performance seemed to be too coy at times and too
conveniently vulnerable to be totally credible, she nevertheless is the
perfect counterpoint to his tortured being, sharing with him all the
anguish of living, and leaving him with the uncertainty of how she feels
about him romantically. The ambulance drivers more or less drove home
the philosophical points of the film, as they acted out the insanity of
the situation they were in and complemented his mood swings of being
beaten down or hyper, with the sheer madness of their gall and sometimes
perversive attitude toward the job.</P>
<P>The photography was mesmerizing, capturing the hostile living conditions
of the neighborhood and filling the screen at times with the beauty of a
fire show amid the sirens and turbulence of the night, and in the
background, we can see the famous city skyscrapers of the city
shimmering in the night sky, seemingly changing colors.</P>
<P>I'm glad that Scorsese has made a film that asks a lot of questions of
the viewer, questions that take time to answer because they are complex,
and could best be answered by one's experience with matters of life and
death. And from what is mentioned in the story, we learn that there are
spirits that pull you one way or the other, and sometimes the pull is
not to want to live anymore. That should give one something to think
about.</P>
<P>Scorsese has made a technically perfect film and an artistic one, but is
one that is not suited for everyone's taste, since it takes getting used
to the trauma of the story and its appalling inertia; but, the benefits
are immense for those who stick with it. Scorsese is undoubtedly one of
the finest working directors and he knows how to provoke an audience to
feel the pain of someone else, something that is very difficult to
obtain in this medium. This is a very tough film to honestly say that
you thoroughly enjoyed it, but what's more important than that, is how
it lingers with you for a long time after seeing it and how compelling
it is in a meaningful way. This film, I expect, will be better thought
of than most films of the '90s that attempt to focus in on the city
landscape, including all those films that were so entertaining but in
the end were not as nurturing to the soul as this one was.</P>
<P>It is easy to compare this film to his masterpiece, Taxi Driver, and say
that both films were about a dying city, about someone who works by
driving either a taxi or ambulance at night, and about a similar hero
who had a tortured soul that needed redemption, but the former film was
so much better because it had more action in it, more energy, and did
not compromise the story's pessimism. But I found this film to be more
subtle and more optimistic in a spiritual sense, and even its most
pressing fault, that the subject matter hits too close to the miserable
reality of things in the city and makes this a difficult film to sit
through, should not be that deterring to the serious moviegoer. This
film can't help being anything but a disturbing film, one that questions
the degree of contemporary insanity, and it is not necessarily a better
or worse film than the other one, but it is one that has more
psychological layers of complexity to it that needs to be looked at more
carefully.</P>
