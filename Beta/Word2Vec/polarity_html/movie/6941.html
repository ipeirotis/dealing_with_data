<PRE>                               THAT DARN CAT
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     After seeing and being disappointed by the recent (1997) remake of
THAT DARN CAT, we decided to go back and watch the original 1965
version starring Hayley Mills and Dean Jones.  Although dated, the
original clearly outshines the remake.  Even the cat in the original
possesses superior acting talent and a wider ranges of emotions.</P>
<P>     Both versions are based on the book "Undercover Cat" by Gordon and
Mildred Gordon.  The book's authors as well as Bill Walsh are credited
with writing the screenplay for the original.  I have been told that
the botched screenplay for the new version went through so many
rewrites that the writers, S. M. Alexander and L. A. Karaszewski, tried
to disassociate themselves from it.  While no masterpiece, the script
for the 1965 film evidences a certain charm.  Unlike the broad
slapstick of the remake, the original has a gentler and more subtle
humor, plus it takes the cat and the detective story more seriously.</P>
<P>     Both stories share a common plot outline.  The cat, named D.C.
for That Darn Cat, roams regularly every night.  On one such occasion,
a kidnapped woman replaces D.C.'s collar with her watch.  D.C.'s owner,
Patti Randall (Mills), discovers the watch and that someone has started
to write "help" on the backside.  (The remake changes it so that the
partial word becomes a profanity, and they make much of the fact that
it is cuss word.  The original is much tamer, the only hint at foul
language coming when Patti says her dad called D.C. something worse
than "That Darn Cat.")</P>
<P>     Whereas the new version has Christina Ricci as an apathetic teen,
the original had the ever peppy Hayley Mills.  Back in the 1960s,
happiness was considered acceptable behavior for teenagers in films.
Whereas angst-ridden Ricci tries to be unlikable, Mills's cheerfulness
and sweetness makes her eminently likable.</P>
<P>     Patti takes the watch to FBI Agent Zeke Kelso (Jones), who
reluctantly organizes a team of agents to track D.C. on one of his
nightly jaunts.  Kelso takes his job seriously, which actually makes
the result funnier.  "Wherever the informant (the cat) leads," Kelso
lectures his crack team.  "It is our responsibility to follow him in a
fluid moving perimeter."</P>
<P>     The remake has Doug E. Doug as Kelso, and he so overacts that it
is embarrassing to watch him.  Jones does some slapstick in the
original, but controls his acting.  Outlandishness by itself rarely
provokes laughter.  Doug's Kelso was a buffoon, whereas Jones's Kelso
approaches his assignment with gravity.</P>
<P>     In the original, Kelso tracks the cat with figures on a board as a
admiral might track his fleet.  The agents sternly report in on D.C.'s
every move.  "I have the informant in sight," radios one of the agent
trackers.  "He's turning west in the alley toward Whittier Drive."
Director Robert Stevenson (OLD YELLER) treats the material as a
detective story that is humorous.  The more the agents believe, the
better it works.</P>
<P>     The show has a strong supporting cast including William Demarest,
Frank Gorshin, Roddy McDowall, and Ed Wynn.  They all contribute to
several interesting subplots.</P>
<P>     My favorite part of the show?  The drive-in.  Patti and her
boyfriend, Canoe (Tom Lowell), sit in his Woody with a surf board in
back as they watch a surfer film.  She complains that "all the surfer
movies are alike," but they sit with their eyes glued to the screen
anyway.</P>
<P>     The original THAT DARN CAT runs a little too long at 1:56.  It is
rated G and contains nothing offensive.  The movie is suitable for the
entire family.  My son Jeffrey, almost 8, likes both version, but
prefers the remake.  Go figure.  I hated the remake, but recommend the
original and give it ** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
