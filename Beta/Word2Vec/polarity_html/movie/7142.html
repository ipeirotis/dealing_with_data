<P>     If someone asked you a series of questions today, would you give 
the same answers you might have given a year ago?  Five years ago?  Ten 
years ago?  This apparently simple premise provides the spine for 
Russian director Nikita Mikhalkov's surprisingly powerful and affecting 
documentary, ANNA.  Completed in 1993, the film, which is distributed in 
North America by tiny New Yorker Films, is only now making its slow way 
from coast to coast, playing in festivals and at special events.  It's 
worth searching out.</P>
<P>     Mikhalkov sat down with his daughter, Anna, roughly once a year 
while she was between ages six and seventeen, and asked her a series of 
questions taken from this set:  What do you love the most?  What do you 
hate the most?  What scares you the most?  What do you want more than 
anything right now?  What do you expect from life?  What does the 
homeland mean to you?  With the cameras rolling, Anna answered these 
questions, first as a carefree girl, then as a naive adolescent, and, 
finally, as a deeply introspective young woman.  </P>
<P>     As a simple study of one girl's development into womanhood, ANNA 
would be fascinating enough, but Mikhalkov uses the film as a means to 
perform an autopsy of the changes in Russia from 1980 to 1991.  Even as 
the director records the growth of his eldest daughter, he examines the 
massive upheaval in the Soviet Union -- Brezhnev's death, the quick 
reigns of Andropov and Chernenko, Gorbachev's rise, peristroika, the 
failed coup of 1991, and Yeltsin's ushering in a new era of democracy.  
Some of the historical footage has previously been aired on North 
American television news broadcasts, but many of the most fascinating 
clips will be unfamiliar to Western viewers.  Through those, we gain 
insight into the mindset of the Russian people during the turbulent 
'80s.</P>
<P>     As for Anna, although we watch her grow up, much of her life 
remains a mystery to us, as was intended.  Mikhalkov is not attempting 
to be her biographer; he is using her responses to document universal 
truths about how our perspectives change with age.  Nevertheless, 
because Anna is the one answering those questions, it's impossible to 
come away from this film without an appreciation of the thoughtful and 
intelligent woman she has become.</P>
<P>     Here's a sampling of how Anna's views change over the years.  At 
age six, her response to the question "What scares you the most?" is 
"the witch".  A year later, it is "fights."  By the time she's nine, 
however, it's "that war might break out."  For many years, nuclear 
devastation is her most powerful fear, until her last interview, when 
she confesses that she is frightened that the changes in her homeland 
might result in "the loss of [her] inner world."  Likewise, her opinion 
of what she loves the most evolves from nature to Soviet leaders to her 
family.  The most poignant moment in the film occurs during the final 
interview, when tears streak Anna's cheeks as she tries to explain what 
her country means to her.</P>
<P>     I have always been fascinated by this sort of motion picture, which 
implements some of the same ideas as Michael Apted's 7 UP series.  This 
is a far more intimate portrait, however, since Mikhalkov's subject is 
his daughter, not a relative stranger.  A great deal of time and 
creative energy went into ANNA, and, towards the beginning, when 
censorship was in full swing in the USSR, the production had to be 
carried out in secret, at great risk to all involved.  The result is a 
fine testimony to the invested effort.  ANNA is perhaps the best "home 
movie" ever made because it says so much not only about one person but 
about the shifting sands beneath societies and empires.  We can hope 
that Mikhalkov keeps the promise he makes at the end of ANNA:  to return 
in thirteen years with a sequel of sorts based on the responses of his 
youngest daughter, Nadia (who starred in his 1994 Academy Award winning 
feature, BURNT BY THE SUN), to the same telling questions.  </P>
