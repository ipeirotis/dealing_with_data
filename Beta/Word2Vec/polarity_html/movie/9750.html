<P>     With a title like THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE, one might reasonably 
assume that actor Bill Murray's latest endeavor is a parody of 
Hitchcock's twice-made film, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.  In fact, 
although the movie takes a few stabs at mocking Hitchcockian plot 
twists, it's mainly a satire of the James Bond pictures.  Unlike many 
similar productions, this one has a smart, knowing script that 
understands just how to play up all the tricks and contrivances of the 
secret agent genre to their best comic effect.  It's a breezy, fun film 
that offers more than a few solid laughs.</P>
<P>     Murray plays Wallace Richie, an American from Des Moines who 
decides to celebrate his birthday by purchasing a plane ticket and 
flying to see his brother, James (Peter Gallagher), and sister-in-law, 
Barbara (Anna Chancellor), in London.  And, while James is delighted to 
see Wallace, the visit comes at an inopportune time – he is on the verge 
of closing a big deal with some German businessmen and he needs an 
quiet, conservative dinner party without a wild card like Wallace around 
to disturb things.  So, for a birthday present, James gives Wallace an 
evening's participation in the "Theater of Life," an experimental form 
of entertainment that allows normal people to act out their fantasies.  
Only, instead of becoming involved in this "Theater of Life," Wallace 
accidentally intercepts a phone call intended for a real hit man, and, 
as a result, he becomes embroiled in a web of espionage, attempted 
assassinations, and a would-be terrorist attack at the signing of a 
peace treaty between Russia and England.</P>
<P>     It's vitally impossible for the premise of a mistaken identity to 
sustain an entire motion picture, but THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE 
employs enough variations that, until the very end, proceedings remain 
surprisingly lively.  Of course, it could be argued that the situation 
in this film is so outrageous that it's as much a "fish out of water" 
scenario as a "mistaken identity" one.  Wallace is, after all an 
"innocent" American thrown into the midst of a European game of murder, 
mayhem, and blackmail.  There's a little of CROCODILE DUNDEE's charm at 
work here.  It helps that Murray, whose films vary from the good 
(GROUNDHOG DAY) to the horrible (SCROOGED), is in top form.  Throughout 
the entire film, Wallace is completely oblivious to his danger, and, as 
a result, Murray gets a chance to develop his own brand of comic-action 
hero -- a bizarre mixture of Dirty Harry, James Bond, and Austin Powers.  
The running joke is that everybody mistakes Wallace for one of the best 
in the spy business because of the ease with which he dispatches his 
enemies, even though every one of his victories is accidental.  </P>
<P>     Every secret agent movie, no matter how silly, demands three 
accessories:  a beautiful woman, a nasty villain, and a threatening 
henchman.  THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE possesses all of these.  Joanne 
Whalley (the British actress best-known for her role in SCANDAL) is 
Lori, the femme fatale who becomes involved with Wallace after she mis-
identifies him as a hit man intending to kill her.  Richard Wilson is 
absolutely delightful as the very proper Sir Roger, a top-level diplomat 
who yearns for the return of the Cold War, and who is absolutely 
terrified that the skilled and dangerous Wallace may confound his plans.  
Alfred Molina, last seen in a brilliant cameo in BOOGIE NIGHTS, is Boris 
the Butcher, the killer assigned to eliminate Wallace, but who becomes 
increasingly impressed by his quarry's amazing skills.</P>
<P>     For roughly three-quarter of the film's 93-minute running time, 
director Jon Amiel (COPYCAT) keeps things rolling along, effectively 
blending satire with almost every imaginable variation on the mistaken 
identity plot device.  However, since this is essentially a one-joke 
movie, it runs out of steam before the end credits arrive.  The last 
twenty minutes of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE are a little too 
repetitious, and even a brief appearance by respected British actress 
Geraldine James (THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN) in an over-the-top role as a 
torturer can't restore the film's earlier inventiveness.</P>
<P>     Despite the floundering ending, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE still 
leaves a favorable impression, and the closing scenes are not completely 
without humor.  Murray recovers nicely from his elephantine flop, LARGER 
THAN LIFE, to essay a character who is both likable and funny.  Most of 
the humor here works – including a mugging where things don't go as 
planned, a boatload of double-entendres, a unique car chase through a 
construction zone, and a hilarious bit with some nasal spray.  Although 
THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE is less audacious than AUSTIN POWERS and 
lacks all of the '70s references, it's frequently as enjoyable, if not 
moreso, and that makes it a worthy choice for a frothy, funny evening.</P>
