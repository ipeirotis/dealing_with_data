<P>The summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies
throughout the year.  We are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually
trashed by critics, loved by the people, and make tons of money at the box
office.  This year, the tradition continues with an update on the Universal
1932 classic, The Mummy.  I have always been a sucker for this kind of monster
movies, and I always seem to be the only critic who really likes them.  That
tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza.</P>
<P>In The Mummy, the up and coming Brendan Fraser stars as the adventurous
explorer Rick O'Connell.  He teams up with a curious, clumsy librarian named
Evelyn, played by Rachel Weisz, to find the mysterious city of the dead,
Hamunaptra.  Evelyn loves Egypt, and would truly like to visit the city that
people call a fable.  Rick has claimed he has been to Hamunaptra during a
battle, and that's why she chose him to lead her there.  Also tagging along on
the journey to the city of the dead is Evelyn's brother, Jonathan, played by
John Hannah (Sliding Doors).</P>
<P>Now in Hamunaptra, the three uncover "The Book of the Dead."  The curious
Evelyn unlocks the book, reads from it, and now the body of the ancient
Egyptian Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who
opened and read from the book.  Along with Imhotep arising from the dead, the
Ten Curses of Egypt become in full effect, launching unbelievable forces
against the three and another group who set out to find Hamunaptra.  Not only
is Imhotep furious with those who awoke him, he is also out to restore the life
of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient Egypt.</P>
<P>Don't expect huge things out of The Mummy, but just expect to have a good time.
 This movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with
beefed up special effects, which may turn off some viewers.  On the other hand,
this type of film is one of my favorites, but that's up to you to decide.</P>
<P>There is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about The Mummy though. 
The state of the art special effects take you into a completely different
world.  We are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert, swarms of beetles and
locusts, and even creatures crawling under a human's skin.  These may have been
in other movies before, but not like in The Mummy.  As of now, The Mummy holds
the title for best special effects of this year, but all this could change when
Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is released into theaters across the
country.</P>
<P>In the past, Brendan Fraser has played mainly comedic roles.  When playing
"George" in Disney's George of the Jungle, he was mainly not known by anyone. 
I would say that Gods and Monsters is the film that gave him a name, and now
The Mummy will give him a name amongst teens.  In The Mummy, Fraser gets to
play an action hero, and I liked him in this sort of role over the comedic
role, as in the films Blast From the Past and George of the Jungle.</P>
<P>Although Brendan Fraser is great, Rachel Weisz gives the best performance among
the cast.  Weisz really reminded me of a character from an old, horror film. 
The way she acts, looked, and talked all reminded me of someone not from this
time.  Evelyn is probably the only character that was likable, considering that
the other characters, like John Hannah's, didn't get much personal attention.</P>
<P>In many films, when different genres are mixed, the mixing usually works, and I
like it for the most part.  In The Mummy though, not all of the mixing works. 
There are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror, some with potential
comedy, some with potential drama, and some with potential pure action, but the
film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work.  The Mummy
could have gotten an
"A" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these.  I didn't mind the
corny one-liners here and there during action sequences, but it certainly could
have done without them.  </P>
<P>The cinematography is amazing in The Mummy.  Particularly in one scene
depicting ancient Egypt, we are taken into a very fun portrayal of Egypt,
mummies, and the treasures left behind by the ancient Egyptians.  The costume
design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography.  From
ancient Egyptians outfits to original troops outfits, the costumes are always
top notch.</P>
<P>The Bottom Line- With The Mummy, the summer is off to its usually great start.</P>
