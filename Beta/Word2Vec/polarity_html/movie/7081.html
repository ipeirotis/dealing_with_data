<P>     Will the real Howard Stern please stand up?  For, in truth, the man 
who haunts the airwaves of nearly three-dozen radio stations each 
morning seems vastly different from the kinder, milder version who 
graces the screen in Betty Thomas' sweet, often-hilarious biopic.  Based 
on the bestselling book of the same name, PRIVATE PARTS relates some of 
the details of Stern's life -- his romance with his wife, Alison (Mary 
McCormack), his early radio failures, his development into America's 
foremost "shock jock", and his vitriolic war with NBC's top brass.  
Along the way, we get to know Howard as a tender, intelligent, affable 
guy who just happens to do an "offensive... obnoxious... disgusting" 
radio show.  So who is Howard Stern, really?  Is he PRIVATE PARTS' 
gentle soul with a loud mouth, or is he just the loud mouth?  In recent 
interviews, Stern has asserted that the latter is correct; his wife, on 
the other hand, claims it's the former.  Actually, it doesn't make much 
difference; the truth about Stern's nature doesn't alter the fact that 
PRIVATE PARTS is an entertaining motion picture.</P>
<P>     As astonishing as it may be for his fans to acknowledge, Howard 
Stern is not a universally-known personality.  His syndicated radio show 
boasts about 10 million listeners and his program on E! ENTERTAINMENT 
TELEVISION reaches another 40 million, but that's less than a quarter of 
the United States' population.  And there's no overseas outlet.  That 
will change with PRIVATE PARTS.  Howard Stern is about to go 
international, and, the more money this film makes, the bigger his name 
will become.  </P>
<P>     Stern's outrageously vulgar, sexually-explicit radio program has 
polarized nearly everyone who lives within hearing distance of his 
voice.  The religious right wants him banned from the airwaves, the 
Moral Majority wants him muzzled, and the FCC continuously tries to take 
him down.  But his legion of loyal listeners have kept him at the top of 
the ratings heap with a support that sometimes borders on rabid.  
PRIVATE PARTS contains an anecdote that explains why Howard is #1 in the 
morning.  Everyone, whether they love him or hate him, listens for hours 
on end for one simple reason:  they "want to know what he'll say next."</P>
<P>     PRIVATE PARTS contains re-enactments of some of Stern's most 
memorable radio comic routines from over the years.  There's a mock quiz 
show where he tries to get around FCC guidelines prohibiting 
vocalization of the "seven dirty words".  There's a sequence where he 
has sex with a woman over the radio.  An on-air argument with his 
program director (Paul Giamatti) turns into a physical fracas.  And, in 
another groundbreaking moment, he does the first-ever live radio 
interview with a naked woman.  However, while these scenes offer a 
flavor of what Stern's program is like, they don't really capture the 
true "feel", which is harsher, edgier, and more prone to offend.  In 
fact, there are numerous times when PRIVATE PARTS seems to pull its 
punches rather than letting them fly without concern for the 
consequences.</P>
<P>     The film begins when Howard is a child and traces his life to the 
present.  His sidekicks are accounted for -- Fred Norris, whom he met 
while working in Hartford during the late '70s; Robin Quivers, who 
started as a newswoman in Washington D.C. before becoming his friend; 
joke writer Jackie Martling; producer Gary Dell'Abate; and even 
Stuttering John Melendez, who pops up for an unforgettable cameo.  Much 
of PRIVATE PARTS details Howard's always-loving, occasionally-rocky 
marriage to Alison, who's played with warmth and charm by MURDER ONE's 
Mary McCormack.  The battles with the FCC have been relegated to a minor 
annoyance (this isn't a First Amendment "message movie" like THE PEOPLE 
VS. LARRY FLYNT), although the ongoing feud with a WNBC program director 
takes center stage during the film's final third.  </P>
<P>     It will probably come as no surprise to Stern fans to learn that 
their hero has an undeniable screen presence.  Unlike many 
personalities-turned-actors, he never seems awkward or out-of-place.  
Stern's surprisingly subdued portrayal of himself may open a few eyes, 
however.  He's never out-of-control, and the only time he plays a 
"sexist, racist pig" is when he's on the air.  In fact, during a 
voiceover, he makes the comment that everything he does is 
misunderstood.  As for Howard's most prominent real-life-turned-reel-
life associates -- while Quivers and Norris are unlikely to win Oscars 
for their work here, they don't embarrass themselves, either.  </P>
<P>     PRIVATE PARTS is aimed primarily at a mainstream audience.  The 
humor here is racy, but also universal, and many of the jokes will cause 
viewers to double over with laughter (like the dig at the Academy Awards 
during the end credits).  And, as bizarre as it may sound, Stern is the 
kind of guy you can't help pulling for.  The question hanging over 
PRIVATE PARTS' financial success is whether enough non-Stern fans will 
venture to see what they may view as a "cult" or "niche" film.  Most who 
take a chance, regardless of what prejudices they harbor against WXRK's 
top personality, will find themselves rewarded by a surprisingly 
pleasant two hours. </P>
