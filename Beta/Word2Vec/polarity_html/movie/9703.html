<P>     It may be an exaggeration to say that THE LITTLE MERMAID saved
feature animation from extinction.  If so, it's not much of one.  In 1989,
when MERMAID was first released, only one man in Hollywood seemed to
believe that family films weren't inevitably box office poison:  Disney's
Jeffrey Katzenberg, who re-committed Disney to its historical life's-blood
after costly flops like THE BLACK CAULDRON.  His vision was rewarded with
$90 million in U.S. grosses, at the time the highest total ever for an
animated film.  And THE LITTLE MERMAID begat a feature animation
renaissance, which begat box office giants like BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,
ALADDIN and THE LION KING, which begat billions in merchandise and video
sales, which begat a desire in other studios to get their fingers in the
lucrative animation pie.</P>
<P>     The wonderful thing about THE LITTLE MERMAID is the wonderful thing
about most unwitting trend-setters:  it was made not to set trends, but to
be an entertaining film.  That's certainly what it turned out to be,
telling the story of a teenage mermaid named Ariel (voice of Jodi Benson)
fascinated with the surface world.  That fascination only intensifies one
day when she saves the life of a human prince named Eric (Christopher
Daniel Barnes), with whom whe instantly falls in love.  Determined to join
her true love despite the objections of her father King Triton (Kenneth
Mars), Ariel finds a willing assistant in the sea-witch Ursula (Pat
Carroll), who offers the Faustian trade of Ariel's voice for the chance to
become human.  Thus begins Ariel's quest to win Eric's heart, ably
assisted by her guardian crab Sebasian (Samuel E. Wright).</P>
<P>     To their everlasting credit, writer/directors John Musker and Ron
Clements weren't looking forward to LITTLE MERMAID coloring books or
sing-along tapes when they put together their narrative.  The were looking
_backward_, to the reasons Disney's classic cartoons endured, beginning
with a timeless story (Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, tweaked for
an appropriately happy ending).  Musker and Clements crafted THE LITTLE
MERMAID with attention to the fundamentals of storytelling, little things
like coherent plotting, charming characterizations and clever writing.
They made sure they had key elements like an appropriately loathsome
villain and sharp comic relief, applied the talents of a gifted group of
character animators and voice actors, and ended up with a minor gem on
their hands.</P>
<P>     They also realized the crucial role of music in the Disney animated
canon, so they made the smartest of all the decisions which went into THE
LITTLE MERMAID:  they got Alan Menken and Howard Ashman to score it.  The
talented composing team behind LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS turned the film into
a full-fledged musical, establishing the fundamental song requirements for
all the successful Disney features to come:  a song for the hero/heroine
("Part of Your World"), a song for the villain ("Poor Unfortunate Souls"),
a love theme ("Kiss the Girl") and a grand, show-stopping production
number ("Under the Sea").  The latter two proved to be among Disney's most
delightful tunes ever, adding the special spark which turned Samuel E.
Wright's already-exceptional vocal performance as Sebastian into the stuff
of classics.  In fact, even the minor numbers in THE LITTLE MERMAID were
strong enough to re-surface later (listen again to "Les Poissons," and
tell me you don't hear the beta version of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST's "Be Our
Guest").</P>
<P>     Disney has re-released many of its animated films to theaters in
recent years, but there's something special about the return of THE LITTLE
MERMAID.  It's not that it's the best of Disney's New Wave, not even with
digitally improved prints and multi-track sound.  BEAUTY AND THE BEAST
provided richer characters, ALADDIN was more energetic, and THE HUNCHBACK
OF NOTRE DAME was more emotionally resonant.  THE LITTLE MERMAID, however,
was the most innocent, and perhaps the most purely enchanting.  Its
exuberance and humor made animation hip again, which may be why THE LITTLE
MERMAID marked the turning point for feature animation as a viable
commercial entity.  20th Century Fox should consider that history in all
the release-date jockeying between MERMAID and their own ANASTASIA.  A
trail-blazer deserves some respect.</P>
