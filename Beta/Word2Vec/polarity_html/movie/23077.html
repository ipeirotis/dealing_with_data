<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The story is set in a grimy town in the Lorraine region of northern
France in the spring of 1912. A group of tired workers in the foundry
are seen finishing their shift, walking through puddles, and coming home
to their wives. There is a buzz among the workers about an advertised
athletic contest sponsored by the foundry, an obstacle race, with an
unannounced prize going to the winner. When Horty (Martinez) wins for
the third year in a row, the president of the foundry, Simeon (Didier),
tells him he won an all-expenses paid trip for one to Southampton,
England to watch the maiden launching of the Titanic. The only catch, is
that he will have to leave his loving wife Zoe (Romane) behind.</P>
<P>While staying in the best hotel in Southampton, on the night before the
ship leaves, he meets a chambermaid, Marie (Aitana Sanchez Gijon), when
she knocks on his door and tells him she needs a room to stay, because
there are no hotel rooms available. Since she is a gorgeous brunette, he
invites her to stay the night with him. Instead of questioning her
motives for coming to his room, he falls in love with her, offering her
his bed - he'll sleep in a chair. What doesn't happen that night, is
that he doesn't make love to her, putting her too much on a pedestal as
an ideal woman. He will, instead, obtain a photograph of her to keep as
a momento of the trip when he returns home.</P>
<P>At home, he becomes upset with his job promotion to maintenance work,
where he will now have a softer job than working the furnaces. He is
upset because he wonders why he got this promotion. He is susceptible to
the rumors circulating that his wife slept with Simeon while he was
away. So he heads for the bar for some consolation, and when all his
cohorts there see the photo of the chambermaid, they want to hear how he
had sex with her. The soft spoken, almost inarticulate, Adonis-like
Horty, soon can't stand telling the men nothing happened and starts
embellishing the story, where it comes out that he made love to her 12
times that night and he did it to her in very exciting ways. Lies become
the theme of the film, as it is examined how harmless or necessary they
are for people, especially since most people live hum-drum lives and
could use a little imagination to liven things up. People also lie
because they feel hurt about things and think that by lying they can
make themselves feel better.</P>
<P>Horty has become a local attraction at the bar, drawing crowds nightly
to hear his stories. This upsets Zoe, as she is as convinced by his
stories as everyone else is, as she believes that Horty is madly in love
with the memory of a woman who probably perished when the Titanic went
down. This lie has changed his life; it torments him when he starts
thinking of Marie's beauty and of his wife sleeping with the boss. When
he gets fired, he soon finds that a promoter of traveling theater acts,
Zeppe (Maccione), hires him on as a storyteller, even as he tells both
the promoter and his wife, that he made these stories up. She agrees to
go along with the storytelling act, when she sees how much money there
is in it.</P>
<P>The Spanish director, Bigas Luna (Jamon, Jamon/Golden Balls/The Tit and
the Moon), known to make very unconventional and sexually implicit
films, has apparently toned down his act here, shooting for satire as
his only proverbial fish in the barrel to shoot at.</P>
<P>Not only did I find this film a bore, the acting uninspiring, and the
motif unconvincing, but what annoyed me most, was that there was scene
after scene of Horty telling his inane story of his dying love for
Marie, to an audience that pays to hear this so they can have a good cry
over it. It seemed to be pushing in the audience face what the director
was supposedly satirizing.</P>
<P>The film is a parody of a need people have to hear great stories,
whether they are true or not, which might be a good idea on which to
anchor a film, but this one had no heart-beat to it. The melodramatic
soapy romantic story, just never sailed gracefully across the ocean. The
film was never able to be poetic or articulate about the point it was
trying to make, instead it just settled for looking good, but couldn't
rejuvenate through this feeble storytelling ploy, the art of good
storytelling. There was just no passion to be found in all these
handsome stars; the idea of the film, that one can't live without
imagination in one's life, was a worthy idea that never fully
materialized. It has the look of one of those arty-farty films, the ones
that only play in art houses and pretend to be something more arty than
what they are.</P>
