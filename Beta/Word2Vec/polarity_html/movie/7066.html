<P>     It is a frequent lament of critics that movies today seem to be
churned out on conveyor belts, each new release looking and sounding just
like the one which preceded it.  Rare is the film to appear on American
screens which shows audiences a completely different world, a world like
the 16th century Indian kingdom which is the setting for KAMA SUTRA: A
TALE OF LOVE.  In this case, however, I think I understand _why_ we have
never seen this world before:  apparently, it was the Cradle of
Monotony.  KAMA SUTRA is a ridiculously tedious study of Indian power
politics in which writer/director Mira Nair manages to take exotic
locations, torture and plenty of sex and weave them into an uninvolving
bore.</P>
<P>     KAMA SUTRA is the tale of a friendship between two young women in
India -- Tara (Sarita Choudhury), a high caste princess, and a servant
named Maya (Indira Varma).  Maya's beauty and sensuality inspire great
envy in Tara, but it is Tara who is taken in marriage by the powerful
prince Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews).  An angry Maya seduces Raj Singh on his
wedding day, and finds herself exiled when her actions are discovered.
Maya is then taken in by a sculptor named Jai Kumar (Ramon Tikaram), and
the two begin an affair which Jai finds hard to reconcile with his
artistic life.  When Maya is rejected by Jai, she decides to train with
Rasa Devi (Rekha) to become a concubine, and eventually finds herself once
again entangled with Tara and Raj Singh in a struggle for power in the
palace.</P>
<P>     For about ten minutes, the glorious production design of Mark
Friedberg and the cinematography of Declan Quinn might allow you to
forgive the plodding pace.  Relish those minutes as you would relish water
in the desert.  KAMA SUTRA rolls along like a block of granite, moving
from scene to scene with a wearying lack of grace.  Nearly every character
is one-dimensional, and that one dimension tends to be sullen and
unlikeable; Indira Varma at least has a certain fresh appeal, but the
script turns her into a Disney cartoon heroine trying to find something
more from life (though I don't imagine Uncle Walt would approve of that
"something" being life in a harem).  The relationships and conflicts
between the characters don't provide much more worth caring about,
displaying the kind of melodrama which would make Aaron Spelling blush.  
As KAMA SUTRA wanders into its second hour, you may find yourself at your
watch every five minutes and feeling as though it were moving backwards.</P>
<P>     You'd think that a film named after an ancient book of sexual wisdom
at least might generate some heat, and unfortunately you would be sadly
mistaken.  There is a fair amount of skin in KAMA SUTRA, and a few lengthy
sex scenes, but without any real passion or connection developed between
the characters Nair's direction makes those scenes look like the soft-core
porn of a Playboy instructional video.  Even those scenes don't make sex
seem as abstract and impersonal as the occasional snippets of Kama Sutran
erotic philosophy dispensed by Rasa Devi.  Overseeing the kind of classes
which would definitely get her in hot water with any P.T.A. in this
country, Rasa Devi holds forth on the mystical nature of sexuality like a
cross between Dr. Ruth and Yoda, except slightly taller.  If someone from
another culture were to learn from KAMA SUTRA, it is that a droning
lecture on sex can be just as soporific as a droning lecture on any other
subject.</P>
<P>     The most distressing thing about KAMA SUTRA is what a conventional
story it turns out to be, its unique setting notwithstanding.  Peel away
the fuzzy-focus scenes of toe kissing and back scratching and you have a
predictable romantic four-some complicated by class, like a Jane Austen
novel with saris.  Nair and co-scripter Helena Kriel seem so desperate to
make KAMA SUTRA seem like a metaphor for something that they toss in a
military sub-plot about intrigue to overthrow Raj Singh which gives the
film an overtone of RICHARD III; there is even a hunchback prince as a
particular reminder.  Perhaps the libidinous, opium-smoking Raj Singh is
meant to represent the corrupting influence of lust untempered by love,
which may at least provide a whisper of a message in keeping with the Kama
Sutra.  It's still not nearly enough to make KAMA SUTRA worth two hours of
your life, even with the opportunity in the final moments to see a man
executed by being stepped on by an elephant.  If this is what passes for
showing us new worlds in the movies, sign me up for another year of
National Geographic.</P>
