<P>     There are a few noteworthy similarities between Zorro and James Bond,
the last iconic hero directed by Martin Campbell (in GOLDENEYE).  Like
Bond, Zorro has a decades-long screen history; like Bond, Zorro has
been portrayed by some hard-to-follow screen legends (including Tyrone
Power and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.); like those portraying Bond, those
portraying Zorro have almost never been of the same national origin as the
character.  Most significantly, in both cases the character himself is
larger than life -- all you need to do is put him on screen and you're
halfway to satisfying the audience.  </P>
<P>     It's a frustrating waste of effort to watch a character like that
dwarfed by a typically over-blown contemporary action film structure.
Antonio Banderas dons THE MASK OF ZORRO (eventually) with more than enough
charisma to create a rousing heroic adventure.  What a shame no one had
enough confidence in the actor, or the character.  Banderas plays  
Alejandro Murrieta, a thief who once with his brother assisted original
Zorro Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins) in his mission to protect the
poor citizens of 19th century Spanish-ruled California.  Twenty years
after that incident, Alejandro is anxious to avenge the death of his
brother at the hands of the cruel Captain Love (Matt Letscher), de la Vega
has finally escaped from prison, and de la Vega's old nemesis Don Rafael
Montero (Stuart Wilson) has returned to old California with a plan to
regain power.  To further his own plans of vengeance, de la Vega seizes
on Alejandro's, training a successor to wear the fear-inspiring black
costume and make the sign of the Z.</P>
<P>     The two make a decent enough pair -- Alejandro the impulsive pupil
and de la Vega his graying Yoda -- but THE MASK OF ZORRO only truly 
comes to life when Banderas is front and center, clad in black.  He brings
a roguish swagger to the part of a common man delighting at being turned
into a super-hero; when he over-hears the confession of Montero's adopted
daughter Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) that she finds the masked man
attractive, you suspect it's all he can do to keep from giving himself a
huge pat on the back.  In the few set pieces where Banderas gets to whirl
into action, whether crossing swords as Zorro or burning up the dance
floor with Elena while posing as a nobleman, he's an electrifying
presence, a genuine movie star giving the audience a grand show.</P>
<P>     In this bloated production, however, it's hard to keep focused on the
dash and flash of Zorro.  The length is padded by the obligatory back
story introducing us to the "origin" of the new Zorro, as well as a
ridiculous sword fight between Zorro and Elena which offers stilted banter
and a PG-13-preserving disrobing thanks to strategically placed hair.
Mostly, the story by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (the summer's busiest
writing team, with credits on GODZILLA and SMALL SOLDIERS as well) has the
generic feel of an action film just one re-write removed from being a Bond
vehicle.  The evil Don Rafael stands before a map to lay out his power-mad
scheme, his ice-hearted right-hand-man Captain Love acts as Oddjob-like
muscle, and the action scenes are strung together with only cursory
concern for narrative flow.  The setting has a back-lot blandness to it
without the back-lot charm of swashbuckling melodrama.   1840s California
might just as well have been 1960s East Germany or 1990s Iraq.</P>
<P>     You may be pleading for something as restrained as the finale of a 
typical Bond adventure by the time THE MASK OF ZORRO reaches its climactic
showdown at a gold mine.  The split story structure once again forces the
focus away from Banderas, as Campbell cuts back and forth between 
Alejandro's duel-to-the-death with Captain Love and de la Vega's
duel-to-the-death with Don Rafael, occasionally interrupted by the
panicked screams of slave laborers carted in from outtakes of INDIANA
JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM.  The whole thing culminates, naturally, in
an endless 50-powder-kegs-and-a-cloud of dust explosion where the zeal of
the pyrotechnicians is topped only by the sound effects guys' goofy
decision to make it sound like they just blew up a pack of dyspeptic
mountain lions.  So much for an adventure which primes you to cheer for a
great hero.  Banderas' appeal alone may be just enough to win over some
viewers; the waste of that appeal, and of the Man in Black's commanding
image, made me long for some heroic figure to come along and make a few
strategic slashes in the editing room.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Z-grade adventures:  5.</PRE>
