<PRE>SCREWED
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>The name says it all.  SCREWED is exactly what people will feel like if
they make the mistake of wasting their hard-earned dollars on this
turkey.</P>
<P>Amateurishly acted, with one exception (Danny DeVito who manages to have
a high old time chewing up the scenery), and crudely written and
directed by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, SCREWED will have
many viewers wanting to head for the exits well before the end of the
first reel.</P>
<P>The story involves the dognapping of a pooch owned by a pie mogul named
Miss Crock (Elaine Stritch).  If funny names are all that it takes to
make you laugh, then you might get a kick out of SCREWED, which also
likes to give its characters names that are humorously based on past
presidents and presidential candidates.</P>
<P>Willard Fillmore (Norm Macdonald) is a decade-long servant of Miss
Crock.  A heartless woman, Miss Crock plans on firing him on Christmas
Day and burning his possessions.  Overhearing his fate, Willard hatches
a plan to steal her dog, Muffin, and demand a million dollar ransom for
its return.</P>
<P>When he and his cohort in crime, Rusty P. Hayes (Dave Chappelle), botch
the job, Miss Crock ends up thinking that Willard has been kidnapped and
that the ransom is for his life.  Refusing to pay, she becomes such a
pariah in the news reports that it affects her company's stock price, so
she quite reluctantly agrees to pay up.</P>
<P>As a diabolically comedic mad-scientist type, DeVito plays Grover
Cleaver (gosh, aren't these names funny?), who is a disreputable worker
at the local morgue.  Willard and Rusty visit Grover in order to hire
him to get a body to fake Willard's death after they collect the ransom.
Before taking on the assignment, Grover wants to show the lads his
prized collection of goodies that he has found in bodies which he has
cut open.  These include a pet rock, a "perfectly good comb," a
"clicker" (television remote control), and other bloody remnants of his
deceased clients. Grover loves to get corpses' blood all over himself
and put filthy things in his mouth in order to gross out the audience.</P>
<P>Without a genuine moment or character and with an uncountable number of
scenes that will have you looking away from the screen, SCREWED tries
hard to be awful and succeeds.  Finally, it hit me that this whole movie
must be one long (bad) inside joke.  The writers and directors of
SCREWED collaborated on the scripts of many other successful pictures --
I know that's hard to believe.  One of them was ED WOOD, the biography
of the director of some of the worst films ever made.  SCREWED must be
their homage to him.  If Ed Wood were alive today, SCREWED would be
exactly the type of movie that he would be making.</P>
<P>SCREWED runs 1:30.  It is rated PG-13 for crude and sex-related humor,
nudity, language, some violence and brief drug content and would be
acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
