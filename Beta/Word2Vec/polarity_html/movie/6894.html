<P>     When we first encounter Luther Whitney (Clint Eastwood) in ABSOLUTE
POWER, he is sitting in an art gallery sketching hands and eyes from
paintings in one of those slow, silent moments characteristic of an
Eastwood-directed film.  Whitney, it turns out, is a professional thief,
and when he breaks into a massive house with walls covered in art, we
expect him to begin snaring the paintings.  Instead, he finds a walk-in
vault where he begins clearing out jewels, coins and cash.  At that
moment, you may be tempted to break into a slight smile, impressed that
Eastwood has merely fleshed out his character under the guise of plot
development.  Perhaps, you think, this won't be just another plot-driven
conspiracy thriller.  Perhaps three-dimensional characters are going to
make it something special.</P>
<P>     Just wait sixty seconds.  The events in ABSOLUTE POWER revolve around
what happens while Luther is in that vault, staring through one-way glass
at the two people who show up in the middle of the robbery.  One of them
is Christy Sullivan (Melora Hardin), wife of Washington power broker
Walter Sullivan (E. G. Marshall); the other is Alan Richmond, who happens
to be rather powerful in his own right -- he is the President of the
United States.  Both Christy and Richmond are drunk, their sex play gets
rough, and just as she is about to stab the President with a letter opener
Christy is blown away by two Secret Service men (Scott Glenn and Dennis
Haysbert).  Luther manages to escape, but the President's people know
there was a witness.  As they try to find Luther, the design a cover-up of
the murder as the result of a botched robbery, making Luther a prime
suspect.  And thus begins the plotboiler.</P>
<P>     Almost any other director would have taken this material and made it
a big, dumb Hollywood thriller -- and frankly, that probably would have
been the best thing for it.  Eastwood is a director with a precise control
over the details of his films, but in ABSOLUTE POWER he spends so much
time fussing over those details that he fails to notice that the story is
completely absurd.  Luther is able to take perfect photos of his estranged
daughter Kate (Laura Linney) without being noticed, but he does a complete
sketch of the Sullivan estate before robbing it; the President's tough
Chief-of-Staff (Judy Davis) turns into a giggling schoolgirl when she
thinks the President has given her a diamond necklace, then has a
conversation with him about the cover-up while they are dancing in front
of hundreds of people at a state dinner.  While Eastwood is able to
construct clockwork sequences like an ambush at a coffee shop, he doesn't
seem to care that, like much of what goes on in ABSOLUTE POWER, it is
resolved through pure coincidence.</P>
<P>     Even the casting manages to get in the way, specifically the casting
of Hackman as Richmond.  The press notes for ABSOLUTE POWER boast of
Hackman's career that "there is no such thing as a 'Gene Hackman role,'"
but that simply isn't true.  Hackman has gotten stuck in a rut as the
arrogant authority figure, and there is nothing to discover in his
performance.  It is also hard to figure out how the pathetic, libidinous
drunkard of that opening scene becomes the take-charge whip-cracker, or
why his press conference in support of his grieving friend Sullivan
demonstrates such a lousy poker face you wonder what kind of politician
this guy could possibly be.  The script, by the legendary William Goldman,
does offer a few nice touches and typically snappy dialogue, and Ed Harris
plays the detective investigating the murder as a courtly and respectful
spin on the usual foul-mouthed cop.  When a central character seems to be
a different person from scene to scene, however, those little details lose
a lot of their charm.</P>
<P>     That brings us to Eastwood's Luther Whitney, as baffling a screen
character as I can recall.  Eastwood's acting has grown more interesting
with the passing years, more relaxed and subtle, but he has devoted nearly
every ounce of energy in the creation of ABSOLUTE POWER to making his own
character sympathetic.  A pivotal moment in ABSOLUTE POWER finds Luther
catching the President's hypocritical press conference on television just
as he is preparing to flee the country, and deciding at that moment to
stay and fight the power.  Never mind that before that scene we had no
indication that Whitney even knew the man in the Sullivan house was the
President; in fact, the scene plays funnier and more interesting if
Whitney is such a recluse that he doesn't even know what the President
looks like.  But everything is subjugated to giving Luther the moral high
ground, making him a doting father and a good citizen with a handful of
quirky traits.  I'm willing to grant the conceit that Whitney is a
master of disguise even though it doesn't seem particularly necessary for
a sneak thief -- maybe he needed a hobby when he tired of sketching the
Old Masters in the Smithsonian -- but ABSOLUTE POWER lost me when it
became clear that this man who could disarm any security system in the
world couldn't program a VCR for his alibi.  Eastwood has turned out a
film which doesn't make a shred of sense, but at least we understand that
Luther was just an ordinary Joe Six-Pack who was stealing a million
dollars in jewels when he witnessed the President commit a sexy murder.</P>
