                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>How's this for a pitch:  Hulk Hogan as a babysitter wearing a tutu.  
While I freely admit that it doesn't sound promising, it's nevertheless 
astounding that the production team was able to take this simple idea and 
create one of the most monstrously agonizing motion pictures to come 
along this year.  By comparison, STOP! OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT is actually 
watchable.</P>
<P>Hulk Hogan plays down-on-his-luck ex-wrestler Sean Armstrong, a man who's 
afraid to get into the ring again because of recurring bad dreams (these 
sequences are so violent that they may disturb young viewers).  To give 
Sean something to do, his best buddy and manager Barney (Sherman Hemsley) 
gets him a job as a bodyguard for computer genius Alex Mason (Austin 
Pendleton).  Mason has invented a new super computer chip and a psycho is 
out to get it, so the engineer needs someone to look after his two 
motherless children (played by Raymond O'Connor and Madeline Zima).  
Reluctantly, Sean agrees, but only because they already have a nanny and 
his job will be strictly protection.  No sooner has he arrived, however, 
than the nanny quits and Armstrong finds himself babysitting two demons 
incarnate.</P>
<P>For a movie to rank alongside CHILDREN OF THE CORN 2, it has to be 
undeniably awful.  Few who see MR. NANNY will disagree.  Even by the 
generally low-quality standards of television movies, this film is 
unacceptable.  Watching the whole thing is sort of like being strapped to 
a chair and forced to watch the worst three re-runs of THREE'S COMPANY in 
succession.  </P>
<P>I'm not going to talk about the plot.  It doesn't make any sense, but it 
probably wasn't intended to.  After all, it's nothing but a vehicle to 
get Hogan into the tutu.  Everything that happens before and after that 
scene is meaningless and nonsensical; you might as well sleep through the 
rest of the movie - at least your dreams would have a chance of 
entertaining you.</P>
<P>No one expects Hulk Hogan to act.  That's a given.  So why does the 
script burden him with several semi-dramatic scenes?  He can't handle 
them - we know he can't - but he's forced to stumble through them anyway.  
Watching "the Hulkster" sermonize about family values and the importance 
of telling your kids that you love them is a truly stomach-churning 
experience.  </P>
<P>No one in this cast can act to save a limb.  Sherman Hemsley is still 
George Jefferson and Austin Pendleton looks like he got lost on the way 
to a mad scientists' convention.  Although Madeline Zima's talents are 
admittedly limited, she's a cute little girl, and occasionally manages to 
brighten an otherwise-bleak experience.</P>
<P>Most of the so-called humor in this films comes at the expense of Hogan, 
as might be expected.  He's hit on the head with bowling balls, drenched 
with water, covered in flour, and electrocuted.  Not one of these 
instances is funny, and it isn't just because of the inept direction of 
Michael Gottlieb.  Such comedy, while once funny with HOME ALONE, has 
long since worn out its welcome.  Here, it's handled in such a pedestrian 
manner that it comes across with the audible clunk of a standup comic's 
joke falling flat.</P>
<P>It's hard to convey the barrenness of this motion picture's virtues.  The 
production values are poor, the music score is annoying, the dialogue is 
stilted and insipid, and the action scenes are shoddily photographed.  
MR. NANNY never comes close to entertainment, even in the much-publicized 
tutu scene, which is an anticlimax for anyone who's seen Hogan's Right 
Guard commercials.  </P>
<P>Do whatever is necessary to avoid this movie.  If one your children 
mistakenly believe that this would be a good way to spend an afternoon, 
offer them anything to change their minds.  And if you somehow find 
yourself in a darkened theater watching the opening credits to MR. NANNY, 
forget the money you paid, and run for the exits.  Perhaps your sanity 
will be salvageable.  The mere fact that I sat through this entire movie 
is proof that it's already too late for me.</P>
