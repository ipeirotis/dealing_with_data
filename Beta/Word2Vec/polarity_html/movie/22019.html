<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is mainly a comedy/thriller about a young New Yorker's dream to
make a gangster movie and of his love for a young girl and his
relationship with his friends. The story has a certain charm to it and a
genuineness that shows through in the telling of the story, as it moves
seamlessly from comedy into suspense, at the drop of a briefcase.</P>
<P>Jimmy Hughes (Veronis) is a luckless New York ravioli factory worker
who, with fellow workers, John (Patrick), Chuck (Neal), and Herman
(Maisonett), accidentally cause the death of a passing fisherman when
John mistakingly flings the only briefcase these amateur filmmakers have
over the roof of a building when it was supposed to only be a rehearsal
shot, while they were filming a movie on city property without a permit.</P>
<P>Nick Veronis makes his debut as actor/writer/director in this very
refreshing story. He did it under the handicap from an accident suffered
three days into shooting the movie, where he underwent tendon surgery
and had to wear a splint on his hand for the film.</P>
<P>It's also a buddy movie and the buddies all have an affability of their
own and seem like the sort of people you would see in real life and not
on a Hollywood set. John talks with an Irish brogue and is the only one
in the group married (Jane Adams) and with a child, Chuck is allergic to
bees and wants desperately to avoid trouble and score with a girl, and
has this silly notion to get the former owner of the ravioli place to
listen to his idea to market shaving creme that is the same color as the
shaver's beard, and then there is Herman, a Hispanic, who takes the part
as a bad guy for the film when another ravioli worker is kicked off the
film.</P>
<P>As if the tragic death wasn't enough for the boys to handle: John is
left guilt-ridden by it;  the police also contact Jimmy to help them
nail some gangsters they are investigating. Jimmy and the boys soon find
out that the ravioli factory is a money laundering place for the mob,
and that their mean-spirited boss Augie (Ed) is involved. He is also the
father of Amy (Catherine), who is going out with Jimmy. He forbids her
to go out with him, even going so far as to beat Jimmy up.</P>
<P>The finale comes when Jimmy and the crew (John and family, Chuck, Amy),
decide to get away from the city and go to the beach in Long Island;
there, they run into the former owner of the ravioli place, Antonio
Gintolini (Ragno), who acts suspicious around his fancy new house. But
he invites all of them in and lets his hair down to tell John about his
life yearnings and his failures, and how he got to name the factory
'Thursdays' because that was the best days of his life in the small-town
of Italy he was from. That is the arranged day he saw his prostitute.</P>
<P>The film offers many keen observations about how these young people
react to the tight situation they are in, and it examines in an amusing
way their life-style and esprit de corps, but the story keeps coming
back to Jimmy and how he is prepared to do anything to make his film,
even if it means stepping on a few toes of some gangsters.</P>
<P>This is an energetic film, it has lots of black comedy and incisive
dialogue to recommend it to an audience appreciative of indie films.</P>
