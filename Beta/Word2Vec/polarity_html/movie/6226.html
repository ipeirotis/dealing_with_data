                         Romeo And Juliet (1996)
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     ROMEO AND JULIET as a movie to laugh at - what a concept! After
his brilliant and highly innovative STRICTLY BALLROOM, director Baz
Luhrmann's second movie is his cinematic treatment of Shakespeare's
Romeo and Juliet.</P>
<P>     Since Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version is one of my favorite
movies of all time, I was curious how Luhrmann's version would turn
out.  Certainly it has been one of the most hyped films of the year.
The Internet has been abuzz about it for quite some time now.</P>
<P>     Set in a decaying urban landscape called Verona Beach, Florida,
the film assaults your senses.  I predict audience reaction will neatly
dichotomize into those who feel the show is absolute garbage, notice
the first song is aptly song by a group called Garbage, or great campy
fun.  Let me confess that I am firmly in the later group.</P>
<P>     Most of the cast view their parts as total romps.  Only Claire
Danes as Juliet Capulet, Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo Montague, Brian
Dennehy as Ted Montague, and Vondie Curtis-Hall as Captain Prince have
deluded themselves into thinking they are in a serious production.
This makes the film into almost a movie within a movie.</P>
<P>     We have black Harold Perrineau playing Mercutio as a guy in drag
with a skimpy, silver sequined dress, a silver wig, and heavy lipstick.
The rest of the cast is not quite this off the wall, but close.  To
have actors trying to be serious ensconced within a broad farce makes
for an interesting contrast.  This is a fun film whose high energy
level is off the charts.</P>
<P>     With most films you start by discussing the acting, but not with
this one.  It is the direction, the sets (Catherine Martin), the
editing (Jill Bilcock), the costumes (Kym Barrett) and most of all, the
cinematography (Donald McAlpine) that is the essence of the production.</P>
<P>     Have you ever set through hours of your neighbor's home videos
where you watched his constant pans and zooms until you get dizzy from
his blurring images?  Well, McAlpine does this with great and effective
gusto.  Has that guy got a gun, well lets zoom in on it.  Fast action
on the periphery of the scene, then quick pan over there.  Couple this
with light speed editing, and you've got a film that veritably pulsates
with energy.</P>
<P>     The sets are extremely colorful and outlandish as are the
costumes.  Friar Laurence (Pete Postlethwaite), for example, is shown
without a shirt but with a large cross tattooed on his back.  Most of
the Montagues wear Hawaiian shirts and have multicolored hair.  The
Capulets stick to wearing all black and have greasy slicked back
hairdos.</P>
<P>     Religious imagery crops up everywhere.  We have neon crosses,
cheap Virgin Mary figurines that light up, and even their fancy silver
and gold guns have the Virgin Mary on the gun stock.  There is even a
dream sequence where Mercutio dances in drag at a bacchanal under an
enormous picture of the Virgin Mary.  Many will view all of this as
sacrilegious, but I took it as good satire.  If you think you will be
offended, then consider this review as fair warning to avoid this
picture.</P>
<P>     The show starts and ends with a small, cheap TV set in the middle
of a black background.  It switches from video snow to a news anchor
(Edwina Moore who played the WMIA Co-Anchor in UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL)
who delivers the prologue, "In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, two
households both alike in dignity", and the epilogue, "never was a tale
of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo."</P>
<P>     The editing is even less subtle than the photography.  During the
prologue, we keep switching to the words IN FAIR VERONA on a solid
background to make sure we are not missing the points.  In fact through
out the show, we have cuts to newspaper headlines telling us about the
events we are witnessing.  Moreover, the cast keeps walking by almost
broken TVs set out in the open where newscasters (including Annette
Bining) are reporting the events in real time.  There isn't a subtle
moment in the movie.</P>
<P>     The music (Nellee Hooper) and the sound of the film are dramatic
and impressive.  In the scene where Tybalt (John Leguizamo) and
Mercutio begin to spar, the music switches to loud snare drums.  The
music is quite eclectic ranging from rock to "Tristan und Isolde."  The
sounds, especially of the ever prevalent guns and hot cars, are loud
and jolting.</P>
<P>     The acting by most of the cast is full of exaggerated gestures,
but next to Mercutio, the most outlandish is that Diane Venora as
Gloria Capulet, Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet and Miriam Margolyes
as the Nurse.  The Nurse always refers to our pair of star crossed
lovers as "Romao" and "Huliet."</P>
<P>     I was originally invited to a press screening a week ago, but it
was canceled the day before since the studio said they could not get
the prints out.  Since it is just about to open, this is usually a bad
sign and means the film is in trouble.  I am not sure what the problem
was.  Perhaps the editor wanted to interlace some more newspaper images
into the print.  At any rate, Baz Luhrmann's ROMEO AND JULIET should be
controversial and popular, the former to make even more of the latter.</P>
<P>     Most Shakespeare, even Ian McKellen's vision of RICHARD III as a
World War II British Fascist, is done seriously.  Here, the critics in
the theater were laughing with the picture.  Baz Luhrmann has turned a
romantic tragedy into a farce and an extremely handsome looking farce
at that.</P>
<P>     The downfall of the show has to be the acting.  Visuals like Dave
Paris (Paul Stephen Rudd) being on the cover of Time as the most
eligible bachelor in the land are funny, but most of the actors do
little more than read their lines.  The script by Baz Luhrmann and
Craig Pearce is a very literal adaptation of Shakespeare's text, but
the director uses the images of the story and not the words to convey
his message which is a shame.</P>
<P>     The acting by Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio is good, but
nothing special.  They've all done better work.  The rest of the cast
is okay.  The excitement of the film can be attributed to Baz Luhrmann
and his previously mentioned crew.  A director who places much of the
balcony scene in and under the water of rich Capulet's swimming pool is
one not afraid to take risk.  Also stretching the limits are the
constant aerial sequences of police helicopters patrolling the crime
infested city with search lights.  A wild picture by a bold director.</P>
<P>     ROMEO AND JULIET runs about 2 hours and my guess is that the film
is rated R.  They were lucky to have a screening much less get out a
press kit.  The film contains one drug use scene, bloody violence, but
no bad language, sex or nudity.  Given that the much tamer Zeffirelli
film had brief and effective male and female nudity, I was surprised
that this outre version didn't.  The show should be fine for teenagers,
who will probably love it.  I found it great fun and give it a thumbs
up.  It is destined for cult classic status.  Although I rate it ***,
if you see it and hate it, don't say I didn't warn you that it was
extremely bizarre and certainly not for everyone.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
