ELECTION (director: Alexander Payne; cast: Matthew Broderick (Jim
McAllister), ReeseWitherspoon (Tracy Flick), Chris Klein (Paul Metzler),
Jessica Campbell (Tammy Metzler), Phil Reeves (Walt Hendricks), Mark
Harelik (Dave Novotny), 1999)</P>
<P>Election is director Alexander Payne's (Citizen Ruth) cynical satire of
the American schools and the electoral process. In it he questions
American values, suggesting that it is better to lose and be a nice
person than to win and stand for nothing but your own
self-aggrandizement. Tracy Flick (Reese) wants to succeed at any cost.
She even asks God for his help to win the school election, where she is
running for president of her high school in Omaha, Nebraska. She becomes
the easily recognizable villain in Payne's satire of American society.</P>
<P>One of the questions that might also be asked: Is how do you work in a
system when you stop believing in it?</P>
<P>That will become the 64 dollar question for Jim McAllister (Broderick),
as he undergoes some critical changes in his life and seems on the brink
of a serious burnout. That he is a hypocrite, also, will become plain
enough, when we see how he rationalizes his own personal foibles, which
includes an extra-marital affair with the divorced wife of his friend
(Harelik). This is the friend who lost his teaching job because of his
affair with Tracy. What makes this satire seem not to ring true, is that
Harelik actually falls in love with this over ambitious student, who
leaves no impression that she is lovable.This makes Harelik's love for
her seem highly improbable. Jim, meanwhile, seems pathetic and
disingenuous, as he looks down at his friend's ex-wife's cleavage, and
he tells her how much she means to him, as he actually believes he is
suddenly in love. The point being made in both cases, is that these men
don't know the difference between love and sex.</P>
<P>In school he is the faculty advisor to the student council and speaks
from his high perch of moral authority. In class he asks the students
about the difference between ethics and morality, holding out for the
most idealized answer. Jim cannot see the difference between his lies
and how he perceives other people who lie.</P>
<P>When Tracy runs unopposed for school president, Jim decides to talk a
dumb football player into running, Paul Metzler (Chris). He just broke a
leg, so he can't play football, and is despondent about that. He has no
real interest or ability for the office, but Mr. McAllister is able to
twist his arm into running by telling him good government depends on
opposition, that it is his duty to run in order to make the election
meaningful. Paul is one of those rich kids who is very nice and very
popular, but who is not a very sophisticated or manipulative person. In
the meantime, Paul's sister Tammy (Campbell) is having an affair with
another girl. But this girl says she was just experimenting, that she's
no dyke; and, she breaks Tammy's heart further by dumping her in favor
of her brother. In order to get even with somebody for her hurt, Tammy
decides to run against both Paul and Tracy for president.</P>
<P>The three candidates campaign with posters and reasons why they should
be elected. Tracy obviously feels she must win. She has put her whole
life on the line; her sole purpose is to win. Paul thinks he might be
able to do some good. While, Tammy becomes the dark horse candidate by
stating, "Who cares about this stupid election?"</P>
<P>The film didn't know quite how to resolve the moral dilemma Jim got
himself into; it is both funny and sad to see how this once perfectly
acceptable teacher, who could have lived out his career with total
community acceptance, gets entangled with rigging the election and
letting a personal hatred for a girl he was supposed to be an advisor
and moral influence to, get the better of him.</P>
<P>In some ways, this film reminded me of two diverse recent films I saw,
Welcome To The Dollhouse and Rushmore. They all had an anger to them,
pointing at something in society that is not all that it appears to be
and saying that is where the problem lies.</P>
<P>In this screenplay, by Payne and Jim Taylor, it has accurately captured
a certain look and feel  high school has about it. This film was able to
show how its school was not conducive for the individual to feel free
in. That all the characters are flawed, unable to see beyond the very
narrow limits they operate under has made for a very trying tale. The
film just didn't know how to end its story by landing on its feet. It
had a great performance by Matthew Broderick, who was subtle and obvious
enough to bring out the inner and outer conflicts in his life. Yet, the
main problem remaining is that aside from the flaws of all the
characters involved, there is no one else to blame for the moral dilemma
that is presented.</P>
