<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A stylishly slick, romantic thriller, that is pleasing to the senses in
a brainless manner. It brings together a hot director, Norman Jewison,
who just finished "In the Heat of the Night," a superstar, Steve
McQueen, at the peak of his popularity, and a fresh newcomer, Faye
Dunaway, whose "Bonnie and Clyde" was just about to be released. It's a
nonsense caper movie, about a bank robbery in Boston, done by the
antihero, the self-made millionaire Thomas Crown (McQueen), mostly for
the thrill of giving it to the Establishment. You have to remember that
this film was made in the radicalized 1960s and that reason for robbing
a bank might have been accepted back then in some circles of thinking.</P>
<P>A precision robbery is planned by Crown, as he hires five men who never
know him, and don't know each other, to pull off the job. It is
reminiscent of Kubrick's "The Killing," but Jewison's film pales in
suspense when compared to the former. Jewison's film becomes more of a
sexual showdown between the playboy Crown and the attractive insurance
investigator, Vicky (Faye). Vicky will get a ten percent commission of
the money recovered for her efforts to trap the bank robber. While for
Crown, he is in love with how smart he is, and will be challenged by
getting the double satisfaction of outwitting her while having a hot
relationship with her, if he succeeds in romancing her while she tries
to get evidence to convict him of the heist.</P>
<P>We see only one of the men, Erwin (Weston), being hired by Crown, who
comes to a New York hotel to meet his unknown boss. The boss is hidden
in the darkness and gives him money to buy a Ford stationwagon with wood
paneling on the side and tells him he will get a number of payments from
the heist go directly into his bank account, and he is told that this is
done so the stolen money can't be traced to him. His job will be to
drive the stationwagon to a cemetery and unload the money bags in a bin.</P>
<P>After the successful heist of two million and six hundred thousand
dollars, Crown flies to Switzerland and opens a secret bank account and
makes the arrangements with the bank to pay the men who pulled off the
heist in installments. It will require him making many trips there to
keep the account full. The idea being that the Swiss accounts are held
in secrecy, as they ask no questions if the money is illegal.</P>
<P>The Boston policeman in charge of the investigation Eddy Malone (Burke),
gets help from the insurance investigator. She figures out that it must
have been Crown, by figuring out his flight plans to Geneva. She then
attends a polo match to catch his attention, and she then meets him
again at an art auction, where she tells him who she is and what she is
after. It becomes a chess match to see who will outsmart the other. I
mean it literally becomes a chess match, with Vicky winning a chess game
between the two at his place, before Crown tells her to play his game,
and the romance reaches a climax which ends in a minute kiss that cutely
dissolves into a blur, instead of showing what took place next in the
bedroom.</P>
<P>There's a closing scene with a twist of betrayal that was much
influenced by the style of French New Wave films. But the film will not
be remembered for its plot or the twists in it, but only for the good
chemistry in it between the Cary Grant-like suave demeanor of McQueen
and the the cool disposition of the good looking Dunaway. Though the sex
scenes were not very fleshy, it was mostly foreplay via dialogue, the
film, nevertheless, still sold itself on this game of sex between the
two amoral fortune hunters.</P>
<P>The film also offered an Oscar winning song scored by Michael Legrand,
Windmills of Your Mind, and some fancy camera work of split-screen
images by cinematographer Haskell Wexler. But if you are looking for
anything but a fun film, I think you'll be disappointed. It turns out to
be an easily forgettable caper movie that was pleasing on the eyes as
much as easy on the noodle.</P>
