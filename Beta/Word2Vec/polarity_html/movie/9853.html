<PRE>"Why does a dog wag its tail?  Because the dog is smarter than the tail.  
If the tail was smarter, it would wag the dog."
          -- WAG THE DOG, explaining the title</PRE>
<P>     Hollywood and Presidential politics – perfect together.  Anyone who 
doubts this simple maxim will face a challenge to their opinion when 
they see WAG THE DOG, the hilarious new satire from director Barry 
Levinson.  For, although this film is one of the funniest comedies of 
the year, it also carries a serious, thought-provoking message about the 
relationship between politics and mass-market entertainment.  This is 
one of Levinson's best films, and the screenplay, co-penned by noted 
writer David Mamet (along with Hilary Henkin), is brilliantly on-target.  </P>
<P>     The premise is relatively simple.  Only two weeks before election 
day, a sitting president is hit by a sex scandal.  A brief dalliance 
with a Firefly Girl becomes public knowledge, and now his 17% lead is 
about to plummet.  Winifred Ames (Anne Heche), one of the President's 
top aides, calls in spin doctor extraordinary, Conrad Bream (Robert De 
Niro).  Conrad goes to work immediately, deciding that the best way to 
get the public's mind off the Firefly Girl is to give them something 
bigger to think about.  "Change the story, change the lead" is his 
motto, so he decides to manufacture a war against Albania.  Why Albania?  
Because the name sounds sinister and no one in the United States knows 
anything about the country.</P>
<P>     Conrad decides that he and Winifred can't do it alone.  They need 
help, so they go to big-time Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin 
Hoffman).  He has never won an Academy Award, but he's more than willing 
to help stage the war.  They'll need slogans, a theme song, 
merchandising links, and sympathetic characters.  Soon, carefully-
controlled leaks to the press make it to the evening news, and everyone 
is reporting about the outbreak of hostilities between the United States 
and Albania, even though no troops have been moved and no shots have 
been fired.  Actual battles don't matter, however, because, if it's on 
television, it must be real.</P>
<P>     The ones wagging the dog are clearly the spin doctors:  Conrad, 
Stanley, and Winifred.  But who is the dog?  The media, who eagerly lap 
up every drop of milk spilled by the White House press staff?  The 
American public, ever-eager for the latest made-for-television 
war/entertainment?  The answer is likely both.  And, while Levinson and 
Mamet are clearly stretching reality beyond the bounds of credibility 
for the purposes of this satire, there's more than a kernel of truth in 
the core theme.  Political campaigns are often run like Hollywood motion 
pictures.  Television is critical to a candidate's success.  And the 
media loves a good war – just look at the current frenzy that's 
occurring as hostilities with Iraq rise towards a crescendo.</P>
<P>     Levinson directs WAG THE DOG with a sure hand.  The director has a 
spotty resume – he has been responsible for winners like TIN MEN and 
RAIN MAN (also with Hoffman) and losers like TOYS.  This time around, 
he's in complete control of the material.  Meanwhile, Mamet has honed 
his pen to its sharpest to systematically slice apart targets ranging 
from television news reporting methods to the political process.  While 
doing so, he has come up with some innovative interpretations of various 
recent historical events.  For example, who recalls how soon after the 
Beirut disaster the United States "invaded" Grenada?</P>
<P>     The actors all play their roles with zeal.  De Niro, getting a 
chance to essay a character who's not a gangster or a heavy, is 
delightful, and it's easy to believe that Conrad is the best in the 
business.  If I needed a spin doctor, he'd be first on my list.  Hoffman 
matches him scene for scene as the sleazy-but-ambitious producer.  The 
actor almost never turns in a bad performance, but this is his best in 
several years, eclipsing what he did in Mamet's AMERICAN BUFFALO.  Anne 
Heche, who has been in the news for her personal life, is capable as the 
proverbial dumb blond.  Woody Harrelson is wonderfully thick doing his 
best Billy Bob Thornton impression.  Cameos include Kirsten Dunst as an 
actress hired to play an Albanian refugee, William H. Macy as CIA agent 
Young, and Craig T. Nelson as Senator John Neal, the President's 
challenger.  It is also worth noting that Levinson got around the tricky 
task of casting the President by never showing his face.  This is 
entirely appropriate, since everything we learn about the man is a 
shadowy, insubstantial fabrication.</P>
<P>     To avoid making WAG THE DOG sound too much like an intellectual 
challenge, let me make this clarification:  the movie is intelligent, 
but it's also a lot of fun.  This is the kind of film that you can laugh 
and think your way through.  I look forward to seeing WAG THE DOG 
another time, and I think I'll enjoy it as much, if not more.  No matter 
what your political persuasion is, or how cynically you regard the 
goings-on in Washington, you will be entertained.  Let's just hope WAG 
THE DOG isn't too close to the mark in its depiction of specific events.</P>
