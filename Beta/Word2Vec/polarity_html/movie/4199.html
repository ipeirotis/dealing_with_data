<P>     RECKLESS is a Christmas story for all of us who like our holiday
fare spiced with bizarre characters and strange plot twists.  This black
comedy, directed by Norman Rene (LONGTIME COMPANION, PRELUDE TO A KISS)
and written by his frequent collaborator, Craig Lucas, takes good cheer
and Seasons' Greetings and turns them upside down.  Insightful and very
funny, this film sails through a wonderful seventy minutes before
slipping slightly off-track as it slides into its denouement.</P>
<P>     RECKLESS opens to the warm strains of "I'll Be Home for Christmas"
as the camera sweeps over a snowscape to a small house decorated with
colored lights.  Inside, it's Christmas Eve, and Rachel (Mia Farrow) is
reminiscing about holidays past--how she wanted so much to believe in
Santa Claus and would try to stay awake at night to hear the reindeers'
hooves on the roof.  Outside, snow continues to fall, and Rachel
confides to her husband (Tony Goldwyn) that she's on the verge of a
"euphoria attack."  His unexpected response begins an unreal odyssey for
Rachel that ends in Springfield, Massachusetts at the home of a rugged,
saintly good Samaritan named Lloyd (Scott Glenn) and his paraplegic,
deaf/mute wife, Pooty (Mary-Louise Parker).</P>
<P>     To reveal more about RECKLESS' seemingly-endless twists and turns
would be unfair, but the movie almost never goes along exactly the
expected path.  Rene and Lucas have consciously incorporated a number of
standard Hollywood subplots into their film, then spun them off in
unanticipated directions.  Coincidence plays a big part in much of what
transpires, but this is less a plot device than a statement by the film
makers of how real life is often impelled by the vagaries of an ironic,
fickle fate.</P>
<P>     The first two-thirds of the movie successfully accomplish a
delicate balancing act between an absurd comic tone and occasional
moments of drama.  Unhappily, during the final thirty minutes, these two
opposing moods begin to grate and clash, which results in an uneven
conclusion.  The film perhaps tries to do too much and, while it gets
most of its points across, the style towards the end isn't as appealing
as it is near the beginning.</P>
<P>     RECKLESS toys with the differences between dreams and reality.
>From the opening moments, there's always a flicker of doubt about
whether what we're seeing is "really" happening, or whether it's a part
of Rachel's conscious (or subconscious) imagination.  The cinematography
by BLUE VELVET's Frederick Elmes highlights the surreality of certain
scenes, and each individual is left to ponder which parts of RECKLESS,
if any, are fantasy.</P>
<P>     A fair amount of RECKLESS' screen time is spent examining the issue
of identity:  how our appearance to others may have nothing to do with
who we really are.  No matter how completely anyone thinks they know us,
there's always something concealed.  Friends, lovers, spouses--none
see us with exactly the same perspective as we view ourselves.  In
RECKLESS, not only do each of the characters have hidden sides, but the
essential nature of their personality is mutable over time.  Rachel
believes that the past is something we "wake up from."  Lloyd, on the
other hand, sees it as something we "wake up to."</P>
<P>     The cast includes some well-known names.  Mia Farrow plays off her
Woody Allen-groomed reputation to good effect.  She's bright and
sparkling, and what she accomplishes here is easily her best work in
years.  Mary-Louise Parker adds another exceptional performance to her
growing resume, and Scott Glenn is wonderfully laid-back.  Actors like
Stephen Dorff and Eileen Brennan ably fill smaller roles.</P>
<P>     Rene and Lucas explored the issue of identity in a slightly
different fashion in their previous film, PRELUDE TO A KISS.  In that
story, an old man and a young, newly-married woman switch bodies.  In
RECKLESS, the theme is examined a little more subtlety and with a great
deal more laughter.  Despite its failings, this motion picture is a rare
thought-provoking comedy, and a wonderful example of something that, at
least on the surface, looks like a Hollywood film, but definitely
doesn't behave like one.</P>
