BODY SHOTS (1999)</PRE>
<PRE>Grade: D-</PRE>
<PRE>Director: Michael Cristoffer</PRE>
<PRE>Screenplay: David McKenna</PRE>
<P>Starring: Jerry O' Connell, Tara Reid, Amanda Peet, Ron Livingston, Brad Rowe,
Sean Patrick Flannery, Sybil Temchen, Emily Procter</P>
<P>Pre-Review Note: Seeing as the only concern of BODY SHOTS is "sex", I will be
forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the
duration of this review. Because of this, I will try to vary word descriptions
of "sex" (meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms, and\or your name is
Jerry Falwell, you are kindly invited to hit the X up on the left corner of
your screen), so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot
comprehend, fret not, it's most likely just another way of referring to "sex".
I think we'd all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous
so I hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a
very boring review. Though not as boring as the movie which makes Steve Forbes
flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked Mathew Mconaughy play the
bongos while high on god knows what. </P>
<P>BODY SHOTS is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are
filmed ominously, in the way you'd normally expect to see a violent attack.
It's about people who think about screwing, seek it out, and talk about it.
These are things we all do, sometimes. The characters in this film spend every
waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts. Their lives center
around the next sexual encounter, but they seemed depressed. It's as if fucking
is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek.</P>
<P>At its core BODY SHOTS is a message movie, the kind of thing I could picture
really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn
them off coition. Michael Cristoffer (who directed GIA, another film that
treated bumping uglies as if it where evil) is a moralist with nothing new to
say. His characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other, so
Cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by
speaking directly into the camera. They voice simplistic platitudes like "I
like to come" or "sex without love equals violence". Huh? And yes that is as
complex as this movie's observations get. The characters are stupid and
shallow, with not one registering as anything more.</P>
<P>The plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for
carnal pleasure, then the after math (the morning after) of such events. We
meet the characters as they speak directly to us, confiding in us with their
idiotic ruminations on intimacy. I would normally go into the characters and
the actors who play them, giving you the pros and cons, but for this film I
cannot. I'm not trying to be clever or witty, but I honestly hardly remember
anything that would set them apart from the others. With the exception of Trent
(played by Ron Livingston as a bargain basement Patrick Bateman), the rest fade
into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts, defined abs, pearly white teeth,
and creamy, flawless skin. I vaguely recall Brad Rowe as the sensitive one,
only because his character gets the worst lines ("sex without love equals
violence").</P>
<P>In between all the confessionals, Cristoffer films everything like a headache
commercial, with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning. The fact that this
director at one point won a Pulitzer Prize completely baffles me. This film is
made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its
tag line claims to be defining. If BODY SHOTS is meant to say that all
twentysometyhings are idiotic and f**k-obsessed, fine, I don't have any problem
with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way, but Cristoffer
only gives us one side. Additionally that one side isn't even entertaining; the
characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness. Or realism. One
sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the
two most sensitive characters. They suddenly have vigorous intercourse with
each other for no apparent reason (other than that they both happen to be
standing next to each other…alas, if it could only be that easy…kidding of
course), then, not only isn't it erotic, it isn't real. It doesn't feel like an
authentic sexual encounter. Every f**k scene in this film (and there are many)
is treated in the same unsexy manner. BODY SHOTS makes fornication dirtier than
the most scummy porno film. It shows us none of the pleasure that should go
along with it, and most of all, it fails to show us why its characters love
making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it.</P>
<P>The resulting search for nookie (and you can take that cookie…) over one
night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow. The main concern is
much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred. The film shows us two
separate versions of the possible rape (one where it is consensual the other
where it is not) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible
victim gets her shirt torn off. This is a topic that could be interestingly
explored if done intelligently, and if memory serves me I can't think of one
film that has done so, and yes I saw THE ACCUSED which may be one of the most
overrated movies of the 80's next to WALL STREET. Unfortunately nobody gives us
reason to care, not the writer, the director or the actors nearly all of whom
seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off.</P>
<P>Paul Thomas Anderson approached BOOGIE NIGHTS in a manner similar to what
Cristoffer does here, though BOOGIE NIGHTS succeeded. It was similarly
moralistic, but it gave us two different viewpoints; it showed us how the
lifestyle of porn enticed its characters, and it showed us the possible
fall-out of such a decision. The characters in BOOGIE NIGHTS were as idiotic as
the characters are here, but Anderson seemed to care about them. He gave them
heart. Cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones. He preaches to us, by
using his characters to preach to us. This is not the way to get any message
across. Why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of
hittin' skins? Cristofer kind of does that, though without an ounce of insight,
and with a helping of leering exploitation.</P>
