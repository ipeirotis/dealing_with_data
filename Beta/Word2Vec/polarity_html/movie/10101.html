<P>     The best documentaries manage to uncover truths deeper than their
most obvious subjects; the best documentarians recognize that they can use
the film medium to tell stories as compelling as anything fictional.  4
LITTLE GIRLS, a powerful tale of tragic loss turned into positive action,
is more than the sort of "talking head" video textbook most people
envision when they think of conventional documentaries.  It is the work of
a film-maker who knows how to provoke viewers while he educates them, who
has experience examining the challenging subject of race in America.  That
gentleman's name is Spike Lee.</P>
<P>     Lee begins at the ending in 4 LITTLE GIRLS, opening with an elegiac
remembrance of four victims of a racially motivated church bombing in
Birmingham, Alabama in 1963:  11-year-old Denise McNair, 14-year-old
Carole Robertson, 14-year-old Cynthia Wesley and 14-year-old Addie Mae
Collins.  Through photographs and interviews with family and friends, we
come to know the four girls not merely as symbols, but as individuals,
remembered fondly as vibrant lives cut short.  The prologue, accompanied
by the mournful Joan Baez ballad "Birmingham Sunday," concludes with
potent images -- the smiling young faces of the four girls superimposed
over their gravestones.</P>
<P>     From there, Lee launches into a history in brief of the civil rights
movement in Birmingham, one which never feels like a typical documentary.
The knowledge of the tragedy to come lends context and consequenct to the
battles of the civil rights activists; it is a battle which we know will
have its casualties.  And the knowledge of those casualties adds even more
resonance to an unforgettable moment in which former Alabama governor
George Wallace, reduced by strokes to an incomprehensibility requiring
sub-titles, desperately attempts to convince Lee that he is a changed man
by showing off his black "best friend."  4 LITTLE GIRLS creates a vivid
portrait of Alabama in the 1960s, rich with detailed characterizations
which make it feel like Lee always has his eye towards creating a
narrative.</P>
<P>     For all the historical detail, Lee never loses sight of the
centerpiece of the film.  The recollections of the bombing itself are
shattering, none more so than Denise McNair's mother recounting the subtle
condescension she faces when she attempts to see her daughter's body.
It's unfortunate that Lee follows those scenes with the indictment and
trial of "Dynamite Bob" Chambliss for the killings, by far the weakest
sequence in the film.  It may have provided a necessary closure to show
the criminal eventually brought to justice, but 4 LITTLE GIRLS is much
more powerful detailing how this tragedy became a catalyst for change in
the public perception of Southern racism was affected around the world.
Lee also offers frightening comparisons to the recent spate of black
church burnings in the South, highlighting his ability to make the film
many things at once -- a memorial, a history lesson, an opportunity for
healing, a warning to stay vigilant.  4 LITTLE GIRLS is a gripping
experience, an epic testament to triumph over hatred which never forgets
the very personal loss of four families who still miss their four little
girls.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 elegies:  8.</PRE>
