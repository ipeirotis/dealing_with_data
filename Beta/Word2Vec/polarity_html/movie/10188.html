<PRE>Home Alone
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) At first glance, it appears that the Home Alone movies
are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds.
That's true of HOME ALONE 2 and I'd bet money that it's true of HOME
ALONE 3 (opening soon). But HOME ALONE actually has a lot going for it,
and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way. </P>
<P>The McAlisters, all 15 of them, are going to France for the holidays.
Four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before
heading to the airport EN MASSE. The littlest kid, Kevin, is the victim
of the older kids' cruelty. Kevin's patience runs out when he learns
that HIS plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten, and he's going to
have to starve. He attacks his big bully brother Buzz, who had been
teasing him. The fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner, spilling
milk and soft drinks all over the table, a few cousins, and an uncle. </P>
<P>The knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame Kevin. Nobody came to
his rescue when he was being teased, but they all point their fingers
when he fights back. The ultimate punishment comes from mom (Catherine
O'Hara) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the
night. On his way up the stairs, he tells her that "families suck" and
that he hopes never to see any of his family again. </P>
<P>That night the power goes out, knocking out the alarm clocks, so the
McAlisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport. In a
surprisingly plausible setup, Kevin is mistakenly accounted for, and the
family heads off without him. </P>
<P>It's interesting that, in a subtle way, his parents never noticed him
missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from
their children. First they delegate the headcount to an older sibling,
and second, they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class.
They're two-thirds of the way across the Atlantic before they realize
they are missing a child. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, Kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true. He's
finally rid of his family! Life is a dream come true. He can jump on the
beds, watch R-rated movies, eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips, and
dig through his big brother's secret box. </P>
<P>Slowly, the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane. He grooms
himself, he does the laundry, he goes shopping ("I bought some milk,
eggs, and fabric softener"). He also starts to miss his family, not just
for their company, but for the security they bring. The furnace in the
basement is a scary monster, the old man next door is a snow-shovel
murderer, and two crooks are trying to break into his house. </P>
<P>Macaulay Culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor. Still, we can see
that Kevin's character grows, thanks to some good direction and editing.
For example, acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the
scene where Kevin searches out a seasonal Santa at night, just as
"Santa" is getting in his car. Kevin asks the man to pass on his request
- he wants his family back - to the real Santa. </P>
<P>He learned how to deal with the furnace. You turn on the lights and it's
not so scary anymore. He goes to a church one evening and there he sees
the snow-shovel murderer, who actually turns out to be a nice man. They
talk about their fears and Kevin learns that age alone does not make you
less afraid. Finally, in the last 20 minutes, Kevin confronts his last
fear - the bandits, head on (literally). This last act is full of
violent comedic slapstick, and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup,
it is dessert. It's a lot of fun, and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of
the movie. </P>
<P>On the whole, Home Alone is a great holiday movie. John Williams'
original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the
disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls, and the Christmas setting
can put you in the mood for those family gatherings. But it does have
its flaws. </P>
<P>The smallest problem is that Culkin doesn't act very well. As I said
before, he IS cute, but repeated viewings reveal more about how Columbus
covered himself than about Culkin's insight into his character. The
biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda, the villains threaten
Kevin's life about five times. Instead of "I'm gonna GET that kid" they
say "I'm gonna KILL that kid." Some might argue that the tone is the
same, but I strongly disagree. Mixing comedy with specific and viable
threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas. </P>
<P>I'll probably never see HOME ALONE 3, and I wish I had skipped HOME
ALONE 2, but I do enjoy HOME ALONE almost every year. Don't let your
impressions of the others detract from the original, which has much more
to offer than cartoon slapstick.</P>
