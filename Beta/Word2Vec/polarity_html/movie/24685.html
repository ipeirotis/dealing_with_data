<P>     An important note, first of all, about the context in which your
humble narrator viewed MICHAEL JORDAN TO THE MAX: The Super Screen theater
in my home turf of Salt Lake City is operated by local auto dealership
tycoon Larry H. Miller. Miller also happens to be the owner of the Utah
Jazz, and he had set up the local premiere of the film as a thank you for
employees of the Jazz organization and their families. Never mind that the
night of the screening would have been a playoff game for the Jazz had 
they not been eliminated earlier in the week; never mind that Michael
Jordan had chosen as his grand farewell to basketball beating those same
Jazz in the 1998 NBA finals with a spectacular final minute of Game 6.
These were basketball fans -- how could they not appreciate a tale of the
greatest basketball player yet to walk the earth?</P>
<P>     It is testimony to the astonishing appeal of Michael Jordan that even
those partisans who should despise him still can't help admiring him. He
is the sort of larger-than-life figure it seems was born for a big screen
documentary -- and in a very limited sense, that's true. MICHAEL JORDAN TO
THE MAX focuses on Jordan's final title run with the Chicago Bulls in
1998, making stops for highlights of that year's four playoff series.
Interspersed with those highlights, accompanied by commentary from
sportscasters and former coaches and teammates, are tales from throughout
Jordan's life: his failure to make his high school varsity team; his
national championship-winning shot as a freshman at the University of
North Carolina; his father's murder in 1993; and his 1994-95 retirement
from basketball to pursue his dream of playing professional baseball.</P>
<P>     Directors James D. Stern and Don Kempf open the film with a shot of
Jordan alone in a gym, soaring through the air for a dunk while the camera
sweeps around him in three dimensions, MATRIX-style. The tone is set for a
story of Jordan the myth, Jordan the super-hero, which is primarily what
MICHAEL JORDAN TO THE MAX delivers. The early moments of the film touch on
pieces that added to his mystique. There's the pounding theme of the Alan
Parsons Project's "Mammagamma" that made Chicago Bull player introductions
a spectacle unto itself. There's the statue outside Chicago's United
Center, a bronze of Jordan flying over a defender rendered as a shapeless
mass with a helplessly outstretched arm. And there's a montage of Jordan's
legacy of ridiculous, physics-defying shots. He's such an unearthly
presence in the film that I began to believe he could change history --
even though I knew Chicago had lost one of the playoff games featured, I
was still surprised that the last-second shot Jordan took to win the game
didn't actually go in.</P>
<P>     If all one was looking for from MICHAEL JORDAN TO THE MAX was a sense
of his legend writ two stories high, I suppose you could say it was an
unqualified success. But there's such an emphasis on Jordan's inhuman will
to win that his humanity isn't often in evidence. Sure, there are scenes
of Jordan fooling around with kids at a basketball camp, and an effective
sequence capturing the ever-present crush of fans that made his every
movement a running of the gauntlet. There's just not much sense of what
makes Jordan tick. Even when the player himself speaks, it's primarily in
the well-rehearsed platitudes of a professional athlete: "I never doubted
myself;" "You have to pursue your dream;" etc. It's a shock when we see
Jordan getting misty-eyed while discussing his relationship with his
father, because it's such an unusually unguarded moment. MICHAEL JORDAN TO
THE MAX is content primarily to keep the audience at an admiring
arm's-length distance.</P>
<P>     It may be unreasonable to expect a piercingly insightful documentary
in this particular format. IMAX presentations have carved out visions of
the awe-inspiring as their unique dominion, and Jordan certainly fits that
description. Yet the film-makers even miss an opportunity to take
advantage of the format during their game footage. Instead of taking
viewers into the center of real-time basketball games -- in effect,
allowing them to be on the court with the legend -- Kempf and Stern use
slow-motion for most of their game shots. They don't even bother to
maintain chronology within individual games (one disadvantage of the big
screen is that you can see the scoreboard in virtually every shot, making
it obvious when the film has jumped back a quarter or two just for the
sake of a cool image). MICHAEL JORDAN TO THE MAX is all about its star
power, the kind that even appeals to a theater full of Jazz fans who would
wish for a different kind of changed history. As a big-screen experience,
it's all about keeping a hero larger than life.</P>
