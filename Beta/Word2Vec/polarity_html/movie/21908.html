<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It was hard to believe how bad this sophomoric spoof on Catholicism is,
but seeing is believing. Kevin Smith (Clerks/Mallrats/Chasing Amy) has
shown what it takes to make a satire that isn't funny and one that
doesn't have enough bite in it to be subversive (it is not shocking to
know that the director is a practising Catholic). This one is a yawner,
one in which I found it difficult to sit through, as its two hours of
belabored effort and uninspired acting seemed longer than that; and, it
was all in the name of getting beat over the head with the director's
inane indulgent musings on religion, as he tries to gross the audience
out with foul language, sight gags of unpleasant sights, such as a pile
of shit emerging from a toilet bowl, and an irrelevant premise for an
argument against Catholicism, an argument that is about as crude a one
as I have heard in some time. It is also a film that left me disgusted
not only because of its banal argument against Catholicism, but because
it was a wise-guy film, shot with a sneer, by someone without the
temperament and intellectual stability to make such a metaphysical film.
The filmmaker is way over his head in this attempt to combine serious
argument with one of silliness, spending most of his time lecturing and
moralizing the audience with his half-baked knowledge of theology and
then resorting to shock techniques to get across his laborious point of
view, as if it is a startling revelation he was revealing, that there is
politics in the Catholic Church. A typical aside to get at the church
dogma, used by Smith, is exemplified with this startling question to one
of the celestials who materializes, who is asked, "What the fuck is this
shit?" That is not the way a director who cares about what he is doing
probes his subject matter, unless he is a child trying to get the ire of
his parent and thinks his vulgarity counts for satirical genius.</P>
<P>The film's original distributor, Miramax, ran into trouble with the
Catholic League who complained about the film's sacrilegious content and
therefore forced it to be distributed by a smaller studio, Lion's Gate.
The protestors were right about one thing, the film is offensive. But
they are wasting their time protesting, this movie shouldn't be banned
(I don't want to see films banned). This film's only crime is that it is
a revolting film and there is no reason to make it a martyr, we have
enough martyrs in the world already.</P>
<P>This simple-minded tale begins on the boardwalk of Asbury Park, New
Jersey, as a homeless man (Bud Cort) is beaten unconscious by three
young thugs, who are rollerbladers, clad in hockey garb. It is important
for the story to note that the homeless person is put on life-support
and will later be shown to hide-in-him the body of God, who will come
out of him as real as sunlight and will be in appearance a woman
(Morissette). Take my word for it, seeing God in this film is
anticlimactic. The scene then shifts to a neighboring New Jersey
seashore community, Red Bank, and a Cardinal Glick (Carlin) is trying to
get a bigger audience for his church, by starting a movement to make
Christ a happier symbol for his congregation. That Carlin, a natural
comedian, is not funny in this role, a role that is ready-made for
comedy, indicates how poorly things are going for Smith.</P>
<P>The main plot revolves around the tale of two fallen angels, Loki
(Damon) and Bartleby (Affleck), who were banished to Wisconsin (which is
supposed to be worst than hell--yuk, yuk) by God for disobeying him.
They have found a loophole in church dogma to get them back into heaven
against God's will and therefore must go to Cardinal Glick's church in
Red Bank. The premise of "Dogma,"  is that Glick's church re-dedication
will allow
the banished angels to re-enter heaven, thus proving God fallible and,
thereby, negating all existence.</P>
<P>Linda Fiorentino plays Bethany, a young divorced Catholic woman,
questioning her faith, who works in an abortion clinic with Liz (Janeane
Garafalo). She is evidently a special person, a distant relation of
Jesus, and will become the human agent chosen to save the Earth.</P>
<P>The angel who speaks for God; you see, God can't speak to us directly,
his voice is too powerful for humans, so it is through Metatron
(Rickman) that this is done. He locates Bethany in her bedroom and
orders her on a holy mission to stop the two fallen angels from
Wisconsin from entering Glick's church. Fiorentino and Rickman are flat
and unconvincing in their roles, getting neither comedy nor drama out of
their performance, just giving me a mild headache listening to them
deliver their vacuous lines. For those who care, Bethany in the Bible,
is the home of Lazarus.</P>
<P>Bethany, while returning from the abortion clinic that night (it's never
explained why she is there alone at night, but then again, if one was to
look for holes in this story, the entire film would be full of holes),
is pounced upon by the same trio of thugs who did in the homeless man in
Asbury Park. To her rescue comes Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith), the
director himself, who is so full of hubris, he will even speak a few
lines during the course of the film. They fend off the attackers and
attach themselves to Bethany, showing themselves to be earthly morons
not tainted with religion, but horny guys interested in getting laid.</P>
<P>Catholic dogma declares God's word to be unquestioned and to be a good
Catholic one has to accept the dogma without questioning it. So Bethany
decides to go along with Metatron's story, never having left the church
completely, just disagreeing with its politics, and therefore she
reluctantly goes to New Jersey to restore her faith in God.</P>
<P>In any case, even if the the two earthbounds are misfits, they are now
considered by her to be prophets and, anyway, even if they are not
exactly what she thinks prophets should be, she could use their company
for protection. On the highway to Jersey, her car breaks down and Rufus
(Rock) falls nude from the sky hitting the road with a thud. You see, he
fell from heaven and tells them his tale about being the unknown 13th
apostle, but because he was black, the church fathers wrote him out of
the Bible. A few more diatribes go on about the church fathers, because
they were men, blamed women for sin in the world, and the more modern
faults of the church, such as going along with government policies on
slavery and remaining silent during the Holocaust, which compromised
their teachings for universal love. The problem with these revelations,
is that they are not exactly fresh news and they seemed to be delivered
in such a jarring manner, as if the actors were puppets just mouthing
words that seemed out of place. There was just no flow in this film,
just long periods of schlock comedy and boredom and endless talking.</P>
<P>Another helper is enlisted to the cause, on the road to Jersey, in the
the person of a stripper- muse named Serendipity (Salma), who is
discovered in a strip-tease lounge by the crew heading to Red Bank.</P>
<P>There is also an angel trying to play both sides of the fence, covering
all his bets, in the person of Azrael (Lee), a muse of Lucifer, who is
in charge of the menacing rollerbladers. You see, Lucifer, also has a
lot to lose if God is proven not to be infallible, after all, who would
then listen to him, especially after he couldn't get back into heaven
himself. So Azrael is seen as playing a double-edged game, helping God
and God's enemies.</P>
<P>What goes for comedy, is something like this, the crew is in a bar and
Azrael, equipped with horns on his head, tells the bartender to make him
a holy bartender and when he responds that he doesn't know what that is,
he is shot full of holes.</P>
<P>To take this film seriously is a big mistake, which is why I have no
sympathy for protestors of this film. If you got some laughs out of this
mishmash, then you got more than I did from it. I just felt relieved
that I sat through it and didn't walk out. Smith appears to be a very
limited director, he can't shoot action scenes, and his film was
childish and unfocused. It was one of the most disappointing films I
have seen, so far, in 1999, especially noting how it got some favorable
comments when shown in film festivals in America and abroad. What is
particularly disturbing for me, is that his religious message isn't
wrong -faith should not be a burden but a blessing, and his view on  the
corporate heads who finance films, who worship only money, is not
something that I entirely disagree with, I just don't see him as the one
delivering this message.</P>
