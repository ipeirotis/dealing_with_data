<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Robert Flaherty the 'father' of the documentary, was a prospector in
Canada and spent four years raising money to go to the frozen north of
Canada and film the Eskimo way of life. The film retells the story of
Nanook who in 1922 was the "star" of Flaherty's NANOOK OF THE NORTH.</P>
<P>The film opens as Flaherty (Charles Dance) sits dejectedly in a New York
bar in 1922. His film just premiered to rave reviews and Paramount
Pictures wants him to do another. Flashback to 1919: with Flaherty on a
whaler, arriving in Port Harrison, Hudson Bay,   being greeted at a fur
company post by the white man Wisconsin, who manages the post and by the
Inuits who live there.</P>
<P>Flaherty's plan is to spend a year with the Eskimos and film them
hunting. Three months go by and he hasn't shot a bit of film. He then
comes up with the idea of getting the best hunter among the Inuits and
have him go hunting in the old way, without a rifle. He talks the
personable Nanook (Inukpuk) into being that hunter.</P>
<P>The wilderness and the snowbound land are visually appealing, while the
Eskimos come across as a friendly people, easily given to smiling, even
if some are suspicious of the white men, thinking of them to be useless
as hunters. Flaherty finds that he is living in very difficult
conditions, as every day the temperature ranges between -30 and -50
degrees.</P>
<P>Flaherty tries to win the Inuits over by taking photos of them, and by
offering them fruit and sweets. He films them as they bring in a seal,
carve it up, and then eat it. He films a fascinating walrus hunt, and
gets to go out for a long sled trek with Nanook to catch a bear.
Catching a bear is not that easy, and his little party runs into some
trouble when he fails to secure properly the kerosene can on the back of
the sled. His helpers all desert him, leaving him alone with Nanook. The
two of them continue to track the bear, but the bear out foxes them, and
leads them to the sea, while the bear goes back to their camp and knocks
over their igloo and kills their dogs. The two now have a tough time
getting back to the post, but after some bouts with frostbite and
hunger, they make it back. But for Nanook, it is the first time he has
come back from a hunt without any food. The embarrassed Nanook steals
off alone to go get the bear, leaving Flaherty in the village, where he
sleeps with some Eskimo women, even fathering a son with Nyla (Ungalaq).
His son will live to be 60 and will live all his life in Resolute Bay.</P>
<P>The filmmaker Massot shows the filmmaker Flaherty staging shots of
Eskimos building igloos, sleeping together, and lots of faked shots of
Eskimos doing things solely for the camera. But somehow the film works
in a very human way and the thrill of seeing the Eskimos live in such
harsh conditions is something few Westerners can readily comprehend or
for that matter, have ever seen before.</P>
<P>Nanook comes back after a month, having slain the allusive bear. It is
now spring and the Eskimos desert Flaherty again and go hunting geese,
and the disappointed Flaherty asks Wisconsin, why he wasn't told where
they were going. Wisconsin tells him, when it comes spring they are
either 'screwing' or 'hunting.'</P>
<P>The boat comes for Flaherty and he sadly must leave before his year is
up. In the nick of time the Intuits return in kayaks and Flaherty says
his heartfelt farewells, with a special one for Nanook. Flaherty
remembers Nanook telling him as he left,"It was good with you."</P>
<P>The film now returns to the New York bar and it shows Flaherty looking
at the telegram: 10 Feb. 1922- Nanook died from starvation because of a
terrible hunting season- Wisconsin.</P>
<P>The film wisely focused on Flaherty and the hardships he had to overcome
to be the first one to make what has become known as a documentary film.
Both films are distinguished for using the real Intuits to play
themselves. It is also interesting to note that even though Flaherty
became world-famous and world-loved, his standing in his own profession
was nil. So much for Hollywood and what it considers important.</P>
