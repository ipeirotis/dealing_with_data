<PRE>Amistad
Rating: ***1/2 (out of four)
R, 1997
Directed by Steven Spielberg. Written by David Franzoni.
Starring Djimon Hounsou, Matthew McConaughey, Anthony Hopkins. </PRE>
<P>Steven Spielberg's "Amistad," which is based on the true story of a group of
Africans who revolted on board a slave ship, then were captured and taken to
America where a legal dispute ensued over who "owned" them, is concerned with
several different aspects of this story. First, the film addresses the issue
of the inherent evils of slavery. Second, it deals with the historical
involvement of several American politicians in the case, including President
Martin Van Buren and former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins).
Last, and most importantly, it examines the cultural confusion experienced by
the Africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native
culture in Africa by the slave trade. </P>
<P>"Amistad" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements. I have to
admit that I was a little skeptical as to how much I could really get out of
another "anti-slavery" movie. Having seen several other movies and
documentaries about slavery, I doubted that there was much I didn't already
know about it. Fortunately, I turned out to be wrong. For one thing,
Spielberg's camera never once gets near a Southern plantation and instead
sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in Africa, so
"Amistad" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the
very beginning. And some of the images here are, in fact, much more harrowing
than what we usually see in movies about slavery. One scene in the middle, in
which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their "excess" slaves by
throwing them overboard to drown, has to be one of the most disturbing film
images of the year. Spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than I
was expecting he would, and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie
director can without getting an NC-17 rating. </P>
<P>The stark suffering of the Africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow
luxury of the politicians, such as President Van Buren and Queen Isabella of
Spain, whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was
only a small child at the time. Exposing politicians as narrow-minded,
opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff, of course, but Spielberg
and writer David Franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as
something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation. The film
also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time, such
that John Quincy Adams (and probably other politicians like him), who clearly
disapproved of the practice, was reluctant to get involved in the case until
it was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court. </P>
<P>The biggest success of "Amistad" is probably the characterization of Cinque
(Djimon Hounsou), who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped Africans
and struggles to communicate with Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey), the lawyer
who represents them in court. Through Cinque, we are given a window into the
native culture, as he and the displaced Africans try to explain to the prison
guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member, or find an
illustrated version of the Bible and try to understand the story of Jesus
Christ. Cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that, again,
contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of
the political squabbles. "What kind of country is this, where laws 'almost'
work?" he asks Baldwin in bewilderment, when he learns that the case must be
re-tried before the Supreme Court. </P>
<P>Spielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at
times, such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to Cinque's angry
outburst in the court room. Still, there isn't enough of this for it to be a
serious problem. The main flaw in this film, which prevents it from earning
four stars, is that it seems like Spielberg and Franzoni can't quite handle
all of these issues at the same time, so instead they settle for addressing
each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie. This
summer's Contact, for example, dealt with several issues at once, but each of
them was somehow present in almost every scene and, most importantly, all of
them were resolved at once. "Amistad" tries to pull it all together in the end
with a speech from Adams, but it somehow feels a little forced, and in any
case the speech itself, which lasts almost fifteen minutes, wears out its
welcome about halfway through. </P>
<P>Perhaps the best way to describe it is this: "Amistad" is three four star
films edited into one. Almost every individual scene works, but the final
product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence, and thus is less than
the sum of its parts. However, I can't honestly say how it could have been
done differently, and in any case the story comes through with enough raw
emotional power that it is still a very good film, and thus I recommend it to
anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery. </P>
