<P>     GANG RELATED will forever be known as Tupac Shakur's last film.  In 
fact, that's how it's being marketed.  As final features go, this isn't 
a bad one (for the ultimate in ignominious send-offs, see Donald 
Pleasance's curtain call in HALLOWEEN 6), and Shakur is in top form.  
The movie is a generally well-written yarn about police corruption that 
gets out of hand.  For 90% of its 110 minute running length, GANG 
RELATED is taut, well-paced, and clever.  It's too bad that the 
conclusion, despite retaining a sense of unpredictability, is a let-
down.  Characters act irrationally to facilitate a few more ironic 
twists of plot.</P>
<P>     On the whole, however, GANG RELATED is an enjoyable, if extremely 
profane, example of movie-making.  The script, from writer/director Jim 
Kauf (who previously penned the screenplay for both STAKEOUT movies, and 
last directed with 1989's DISORGANIZED CRIME) mixes action, tension, and 
low-key comedy.  Our heroes (who are actually anti-heroes) are Davinci 
(James Belushi) and Rodriguez (Tupac Shakur), a pair of bent cops who 
have just been caught in the Murphy's Law corner of the Twilight Zone.  
What at first seems like a relatively straightforward caper turns into a 
nightmare as circumstances conspire to plunge them into a tangled web of 
bad breaks and worse luck.</P>
<P>     Their plan is seemingly simple:  sell cocaine taken from the police 
evidence room to a drug dealer, kill him using a gun also lifted from 
the evidence room, then replace the gun and coke before anyone is the 
wiser.  The results:  an apparent gang related slaying of human refuse, 
plus Davinci and Rodriguez get to pocket the profits of their illicit 
drug sale.  With the help of Davinci's stripper girlfriend, Cynthia 
(WAITING TO EXHALE's Lela Rochon), the pair has successfully pulled this 
con nine times.  Ten isn't their lucky number.  On this occasion, their 
victim is an undercover DEA agent, and they're put in the uncomfortable 
position of having to investigate a murder they committed.  And that's 
before things start to go really wrong…</P>
<P>     While GANG RELATED's script isn't a masterpiece, the situation it 
postulates is suitably delicious.  The film probably contains enough 
action to qualify as a thriller, but it's really more of a black comedy.  
Kauf has fun toying with his characters and their situations, constantly 
one-upping himself in the "whatever can go wrong, will go wrong" 
department.  I won't give away any specifics beyond the initial setup, 
because that would spoil the primary entertainment value of the movie.  
Sadly, however, Kauf is at a loss when it comes to wrapping things up, 
and the anticlimactic, routine finale lacks the panache evident 
throughout most of the running time.  The final scene is in keeping with 
the rest of the film, but the events leading up to it are dubious at 
best.  But, because only a few minutes are so out of synch, minimal 
damage was done to my appreciation of the movie as a whole.</P>
<P>     It's no surprise that Tupac Shakur is good in his role as a bad cop 
with a conscience.  In films like POETIC JUSTICE and, more recently, 
GRIDLOCK'D, Shakur has shown himself to be a talented actor, and it goes 
without saying that his untimely death has robbed the motion picture 
community of a promising star.  The actor who really surprised me here 
was James Belushi, who is very good as Davinci, the cynical mastermind 
behind the kill-the-drug-dealer-and-get-the-money scheme.  I've never 
been terribly impressed by Belushi's range, but his performance here is 
relentlessly on-target.  The supporting players are also good, with 
solid work turned in by Lela Rochon, James Earl Jones (as a high-priced 
lawyer), Wendy Crewson (as the prosecutor who is unpleasantly surprised 
by disappearing witnesses and evidence), and Dennis Quaid (as a homeless 
man who plays a pivotal role in the proceedings).  </P>
<P>     Kauf, whose STAKEOUT was a lighter blend of the same kind of 
elements at work here, knows just how to play the material to keep it 
enjoyable.  That's not an easy task, considering that the main 
characters are pretty reprehensible and the basic plotline is about 
covering up the accidental murder of a cop.  Nevertheless, in part 
because of a series of good performances and in part because Kauf 
approaches things with confidence, the results are positive.  GANG 
RELATED may not be PULP FICTION, but it's not a bad foray into 
tangential territory.</P>
