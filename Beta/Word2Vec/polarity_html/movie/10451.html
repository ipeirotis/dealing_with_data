<P>     Ralph Fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre 
of period piece romances.  For his followup to the Academy-beloved THE 
ENGLISH PATIENT, he has once again turned to a love story, this time 
directed by accomplished Australian film maker Gillian Armstrong (LITTLE 
WOMEN).  Despite some obvious overplotting, OSCAR AND LUCINDA is a 
mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our 
hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences.  </P>
<P>     The film opens in the mid-1800s, with parallel storylines in New 
South Wales, Australia and Devon, England.  As the helpful narrative 
voice of Geoffrey Rush informs us, Lucinda Leplastrier (Cate Blanchett) 
is a headstrong young woman being raised in the Australian outback.  
Meanwhile, half the world away, Oscar Hopkins (Fiennes) has broken with 
his puritanical father over religious issues, and has gone away to 
school to study to be an Anglican priest.  Lucinda is fascinated with 
glass; Oscar is obsessed with theology.  Lucinda is rich; Oscar is poor.  
Lucinda is forward and self-assured; Oscar is timid and uncertain of 
himself.  Yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- 
the compulsion to gamble, whether it's on horses, dogs, cards, or the 
flip of a coin.  And fate has decreed that they will one day meet.</P>
<P>     That day doesn't occur until 45 minutes into the film, when Oscar 
boards a ship bound for Sidney, Australia, where he hopes to change his 
life and minister to anyone in need of his help.  Another of the 
passengers is Lucinda, who is returning from England where she was 
shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory.  
At first, their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor, but 
it doesn't take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in 
the other.  A friendship is born, and, once they reach Australia, it 
develops into something more potent.  But Oscar is uncertain of 
Lucinda's affection, and feels he must do something to prove himself 
worthy of her.</P>
<P>     OSCAR AND LUCINDA isn't beyond a little manipulation to get the 
desired emotional response, and there are times when the storyline 
curves in preposterous directions.  On more than one occasion, it's 
apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters 
into a position where there is only one possible route.  Coincidence is 
a crucial plot device; without it, this movie can't go anywhere.  The 
voiceover narration (never one of my favorite techniques) is too verbose 
and breaks into the story at undesirable moments.  (However, without it, 
the final twist, which I will not reveal, would not be as poignant.)</P>
<P>     Yet, despite these quibbles, I enjoyed OSCAR AND LUCINDA.  
Storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized 
characters.  Thematically, the film is also strong.  The unifying motif 
-- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated.  
Oscar and Lucinda don't just wager their money, they bet their hearts, 
minds, and souls.  A card game they engage in shortly after they first 
meet could easily be considered a form of emotional "strip poker" where 
defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared, secret passion.  Oscar 
does not see gambling as a vice.  In fact, he believes that the greatest 
chance one takes in life is betting one's immortal soul on the truth of 
a religious faith.</P>
<P>     Ralph Fiennes, who normally plays strong, confident men, is very 
much at home as the fumbling, insecure Oscar.  The actor brings a 
variety of nervous tics to the part, all of which subtly add to a vague 
sense of discomfort whenever Oscar is on-screen.  As good as Fiennes is, 
however, he is eclipsed by Cate Blanchett.  The actress, who appeared 
earlier this year as one of the leads in Bruce Beresford's PARADISE 
ROAD, is mesmerizing as Lucinda.  She gives this liberated woman her 
flash, and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that 
it sparkles rather than fizzles.  Effective support is provided by 
Ciaran Hinds (the male lead in Jane Austen's PERSUASION) as Lucinda's 
close friend, Tom Wilkinson (THE FULL MONTY) as Oscar's mentor, and 
Clive Russell as a self-serving adventurer.</P>
<P>     There's a real magic in the way Armstrong develops the story, 
keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too 
long on any one moment or sequence.  (In fact, I wish she had devoted a 
little more time to the luminous middle act, which has Oscar and Lucinda 
together.)  With the skill of a consummate storyteller, she weaves 
romance, friendship, passion, humor, and tragedy together into a 
complete package.  The characters, with all of their human foibles and 
neuroses, are wonderfully developed by Fiennes and Blanchett.  So who 
cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy?  OSCAR AND LUCINDA 
still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer.</P>
