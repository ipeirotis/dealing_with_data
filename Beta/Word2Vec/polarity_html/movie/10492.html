<P>Blood Simple  *** (out of four)
R, 1984
Directed by Joel Coen. Written by Joel and Ethan Coen.
Starring John Getz, Frances McDormand, Dan Hedaya, M. Emmet Walsh.</P>
<P>It might surprise some to know that Joel and Ethan Coen, who have brought such
unabated lunacy to our movie screens as "Raising Arizona"  and "The Hudsucker
Proxy," made their feature film debut with "Blood Simple," a grim and often
gruesome tale of revenge, murder, and literally fatal misconceptions in rural
Texas. It bears some resemblance, story-wise, to the Coens' recent "Fargo,"
but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations
that characterized that film are scarce here; "Blood Simple" is pretty much
cold and brutal from beginning to end.</P>
<P>The premise of "Blood Simple" is really just a slight variation on the
standard love-triangle/revenge scheme: sleazy bar owner Julian Marty (Dan
Hedaya) hires a shifty private detective (M. Emmet Walsh) to kill his wife
Abby (Frances McDormand) and her illicit lover Ray (John Getz). Things start
to go haywire when Walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic
trickery but, upon collecting the money, becomes uncertain as to whether or
not Marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme.</P>
<P>To reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much, but
what ensues is a series of bloody (and I do mean bloody) confrontations, each
triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually
happening. Every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when
seen through the perpetrator's eyes, but we, the audience, are made privy to
the "big picture" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either
unnecessary or directed at the wrong person. This aspect of the story, along
with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense
that if guns and, in one case, shovels, were not available, some of these
characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components
of the film. The Coens might have done well to title the film "Fear and
Loathing in Texas."</P>
<P>Some have labeled "Blood Simple  as a modern-day noir, but, while I am not an
expert on either genre, it seems more like a horror movie than anything else.
The Coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of
confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters, and the final sequence
is nothing more than a showdown between the one (relatively) innocent
character and the only one of the murderers left alive. That said, "Blood
Simple" is a very good horror movie; the fear and suspense here are genuine.
The Coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter
upwards, such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps
on a gun, discharging it as it skitters across the floor, or when a murder
attempt unfolds in a way such that Abby mistakes her attacker for another
character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film.</P>
<P>That said, "Blood Simple" is not exactly flawless. For one thing, the
motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times; I can
understand that the characters had tracks to cover (or at least thought they
did), but I found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly
resort to murder. And although they at least didn’t have anyone get hacked to
death with a knife, the Coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches; they
indulge in a prolonged
dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it's-only-a-dream
scene that had me rolling my eyes. The film also ends so quickly after the
final confrontation that I found myself wondering if they had simply run out
of film.</P>
<P>"Blood Simple" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to
think it is, but it's a decent movie and it showcases the Coens' ability to
handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner. I
would firmly recommend it to all "Coen-heads" as well as anyone looking for
something original in a thriller.</P>
