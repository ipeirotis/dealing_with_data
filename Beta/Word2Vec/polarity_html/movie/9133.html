<PRE>                     WACO: THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<PRE>     "Are you goin' to come in and kill me?"
                     -Voice of little Branch Davidian girl on the phone</PRE>
<PRE>     "No, no one's going to come in and kill you."

<P>     Documentaries can provide in-depth examinations into worlds or
subjects that you may know little about.  The best documentaries force
you to reexamine some of the "facts" that you already know.</P>
<P>     The even-handed and highly acclaimed new documentary, WACO: THE
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, is an astonishing piece of work.  Those like me
who knew, or thought they knew, what happened to those "crazy" Branch
Davidians in their confrontation with law officers, will not be able to
watch this film without many second thoughts.  It changed my mind
completely, but even those who remain resolved to believe the media
reports will leave with some nagging doubts in the back of their minds.
And no one can watch this film by producers Amy Sommer Gifford and Dan
Gifford and director William Gazecki without an appreciation for the
quality of the film itself.  A tour de force that should get an Academy
Award nomination but probably will not, given the historic
eccentricities of the documentary branch of the Academy.</P>
<P>     The film uses a wide variety of footage to examine what happened
in Waco and to explore who the Davidians were.  Excerpts from the
Congressional hearings as well as infrared aerial footage taken during
the day of the final raid on the Davidian's home provide the most
enlightening pieces of the story.</P>
<P>     Most of the documentary is pieced together from historic tapes,
but some fresh material is presented as well.  They interview the local
Sheriff who says the Davidians were a polite group who worked at odd
jobs around town to support their religious activities.  He says he
thought their views about Christianity were unusual and certainly
different than his own, but not harmful.  The ATF and FBI used
inflammatory words like "bunker" and "compound" to refer to the
Davidian's home, which made it seem like the government was at war.
(In the end, one of the agents raised the ATF flag on the Davidian
flagpole like victors in a war.)</P>
<P>     One of the many members who did not fit the media stereotype of
the religious fanatic, for example, was a middle-aged, black graduate
of Harvard Law School.  The film shows the history of the Davidians in
that area back to 1938.</P>
<P>     Their leader, David Koresh, with his constant two-day-old beard
and his curly hair, looked like someone from central casting, but the
other Davidians seemed much less mesmerized by him that one would
expect.</P>
<P>     One of the key issues of the case was the stockpiling of arms, but
the film points out that this is nothing unusual in Texas.  As a native
Texan, this logic certainly rang true.  Part of the reason for the
search warrant was to look for illegal weapons, but a local gun dealer
reported telling the ATF that he had Koresh on the phone and Koresh was
inviting the ATM to come over and inspect his weapons without any
warrant.  The ATF agent passed on the opportunity the night before the
raid, the film argues, because the ATF viewed the raid as a major
publicity opportunity.</P>
<P>     The ATF had 100 agents for the initial assault. They trained for
days at a military base, having told the military that it was a drug
raid.  They knew they needed surprise to pull it off without killing
the kids inside the Davidian home and without being killed themselves.
Even so, they let it out to some of the media in advance with the
result that the media was there 30 minutes before the raid.</P>
<P>     When their Davidian undercover agent told them to call off the
raid since the leak had gotten back to Koresh, they didn't.  In the
resulting two hour hailstorm of bullets, four ATF agents were
needlessly killed.  (The Davidians were later acquitted in court for
the ATF agent's deaths since the Davidians were believed to have been
protecting themselves.)</P>
<P>     Easily the most convincing material in the documentary concerns
the final assault by the government.  They sprayed a highly flammable
gas inside the Davidian's home for hours in an attempt to drive them
out from the fumes.  When the inevitable firestorm occurred that burned
the bodies of scores of people, including young kids and the elderly,
the government said that the Davidians set the fire themselves and that
they shot their own members.  A government infrared tape shows 2 people
with machine guns shooting from the backyard into the only available
exit.  This backside of the building could not be seen by any of the
media, and this area was controlled by government forces.  The only
conclusion possible seems to be that the government fired, killing the
people attempting to escape the fire, but the testimony from the
hearings are that only the Davidians fired on that final, deadly day.</P>
<P>     The producers were at a special screening I attended.  They said
they believed the official line until they were shown the tapes and
began to dig into the story.  They made the point that most ATF and FBI
agents are hard working defenders of the public.  Nevertheless, they
argue that Waco is a huge black eye on law enforcement agents.</P>
<P>     The producers, after being turned down by distributors even though
they have gotten rave reviews from the national film critics, decided
to distribute the film themselves.  The result is that they have seven
prints showing in exactly seven theaters in the United States.</P>
<P>     So, are there flaws in the documentary?  Undoubtedly, but overall
it is a convincing and surprisingly well balanced presentation.  My
only quibble is with the length.  The filmmakers got a bit too involved
in their material with the result that the film goes on about a half
hour longer than it should.  A shorter, more focused film would have
had more impact.  When I asked the producers about it, they disagreed
and argued that they had already chopped thirty minutes from the
version shown this year at Sundance.</P>
<P>     The best films are those you'll never forget and those that cause
you to reexamine your assumptions.  WACO: THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT is
just such a film.</P>
<P>     WACO: THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT runs 2:16. It is not rated but would
be an R for the mature subject matter and a few scenes of charred
bodies.  It would be fine for serious teenagers.  I recommend this
picture to you highly and hope to see it at Academy Award time.  And, I
give it *** 1/2.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
