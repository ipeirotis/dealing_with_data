<P>     In the production notes for subURBIA, director Richard Linklater
comments on his working relationship with writer Eric Bogosian that "we
decided somewhere along the way we were separated at birth," to which I
can only add that the nurse in question must have known what she was
doing.  No two sensibilities could be more dissimilar -- Bogosian the
high-energy Easterner and Linklater the laid-back Texan -- even when
addressing similar subject matter.  subURBIA is a frequently compelling
film, but there is a terribly fragmented feel to it.  While Linklater's
natural affection for his characters' generational anxieties gives the
story much of its charm, he frequently finds himself fighting with a
writer who seems to despise those characters.</P>
<P>     subURBIA takes place during one night in the generic (and poetically
named) American suburb of Burnfield, where a group of friends gathers as
they have gathered so many nights before by a corner convenience store.
Among them are Jeff (Giovanni Ribisi), a cynical would-be writer and
part-time community college student; Sooze (Amie Carey), Jeff's girlfriend
and aspiring performance artist; Tim (Nicky Katt), a surly Air Force
drop-out; Buff (Jeff Zahn), a hyper-kinetic pizza restaurant employee; and
Bee-Bee (Dina Spybey), Sooze's friend recently released from a rehab
clinic.  What makes this night different is the return of Pony (Jayce
Bartok), a former classmate now making it big as a rock star and visiting
town with his publicist Erica (Parker Posey) for a concert.  The friends
wander the night in search of entertainment, responding to Pony's presence
and dealing with the lack of direction in their lives.</P>
<P>     The opening images of subURBIA show an endless stream of tract houses
and strip malls, peppered with construction sites building even more of
the same.  Linklater films it almost as one uninterrupted drive-by take, a
numbing panorama of monotony representing a world which seems designed to
destroy imagination, and it suggests that the director's rage, such as it
is, is directed at the place rather than at the people.  The characters in
subURBIA were raised by parents who viewed the placid comfort of their
surroundings as the achievement of a dream and instilled that same idea in
their children.  While they realize that they want something different,
however, they young characters don't know what that something could be;
their souls lack the vocabulary to define their dreams in any other way
but "not this."</P>
<P>     Bogosian, on the other hand, is far less forgiving.  His script sets
up a counterpoint between the principal characters and Nazeer (Ajay
Naidu), the Pakistani immigrant whose family owns the convenience store
where the friends congregate.  In one blistering exchange, Nazeer mocks
Buff by noting that he will be an engineer after two more years of
college, while Buff and his friends will still be wasting their lives
sitting in front of convenience stores.  Nazeer also clashes with Tim,
whose racist tirades are an expression of his twisted sense of the way the
world ought to be.  It is Tim, the alcoholic who cut off part of his own
finger to get out of the service when he realized it was hard work, who
gets the film's best line, a brutal summation of Bogosian's disgust:  "I'm
an American; I'm owed something."  While Sooze plays at addressing
"issues" she knows nothing about and Jeff strips naked in an expression of
divine apathy, Bogosian can only shake his head at them through the words
of Nazeer:  "You people are so stupid.  You throw everything away."</P>
<P>     The schism between the perspectives of Linklater and Bogosian makes
subURBIA a film of mixed messages, but it is still worth watching thanks
to the talented cast members and some individual moments of genuine
clarity.  Dina Spybey is particularly affecting as Bee-Bee, who struggles
against a relapse after an unfortunate encounter with Buff; Steve Zahn
(THAT THING YOU DO!), who originated Buff on stage, channels what begins
as a Crispin Glover impression into a unique portrayal of blissful
oblivion.  The echoes of Glover call to mind another film about
disaffected youth, 1986's RIVER'S EDGE, but subURBIA is wittier and not
nearly as bleak.  Though you may find yourself wondering why these
characters would have been high school friends, the interaction between
them is almost always interesting enough to hold your attention.  The
problem is that, while your attention is held on those characters, you
can't get a handle on what you are supposed to think about them.  Critics
of films about Generation X-ers often repeat the criticisms of real-life
Generation X-ers, that they are merely whining children of privilege who
have never had to struggle for anything in their lives.  Bogosian is one
of those critics; Linklater seems intent on answering them.  subURBIA
would have been a more powerful film if between them they had chosen one
object of scorn:  suburbanites, or suburbia itself.</P>
