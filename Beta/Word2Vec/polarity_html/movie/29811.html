<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A truly magificent and authentic film set in the sparsely populated mountainous
region of Dolpo in northwest Nepal. Its appeal is both visually and in its
compelling story about the Tibetan villagers who live by their traditions. The
filmmaker is the Frenchman Eric Valli, someone who has been interested in
Buddhism since childhood and who was a former photographer for National
Geographic and has recently been a documentary filmmaker and author. He has
lived in Nepal for the last 18 years with his wife and three children. The cast
is made up of mostly non-professionals who have not only not acted before, but
some have never even seen a film. Their wonderful expressive faces are
reflective of the mountains and give the film its very appealing look. Himalaya
is noteworthy for its breathtaking shots of mountains that scale as high as
10,000 feet, as Valli daringly shot this almost impossible mountain trek for
nine months in all kinds of conditions--including a blinding winter snowstorm.
It was shot in Cinemascope using wide-angle panoramic framed shots and was
nominated for an Oscar as Best Foreign Film, but lost to Pedro Almodovar's All
About My Mother. </P>
<P>The story in its simplicity can be viewed as a fable about a generational
conflict between a stubborn religious traditionalist set in his ways versus the
younger man who is influenced by the pragmatism of modern ways and is just as
pigheaded as his opponent. </P>
<P>A yak caravan bringing back salt needed to trade for grain returns to the tiny
Dolpo mountain village and one of the men on the trek, Karma (Gurgon Kyap),
brings back the dead body of the young chief, the chief's elderly father, Tinle
(Thilen Lhondup), who retired so his son could be the caravan leader. He
suspects the ambitious Karma of foul play, even though, the two young men were
the best of friends. The irritable Tinle is desperate to get someone from his
family to lead the next salt-trek across the mountain, a trek that must be done
before winter sets in as it's a matter of survival for the villagers to get
food. The dead man's son, Tsering (Karma Wangiel), is too young to lead the yak
caravan and Tinle is too old. He tries to recruit his other son to be the
leader, a young man in his twenties, Norbou (Karma Tenzing Nyima Lama). But
Norbou has lived in a monastery as a monk since he was 8-years-old and has no
skills to lead a caravan, as he has devoted his life to painting and meditation
and has studied to be a lama. </P>
<P>The heart of the film begins when Karma refuses to wait for the auspicious date
of his trek to be set by the villager's council of lamas and risks being
ostracized for disobeying their traditions. He acts in such haste because he's
worried about winter setting in and impulsively takes some of the younger men
with him. Tinle waits for the traditional word from the lamas as the auspicious
date is set several days later and he is joined by the superstitious elderly
villagers, his dead son's wife Pema (Lhakpa Tsamchoe) and Tsering, whose name
has now been changed to the more humble one of Passang. Norbou also decides to
help his father by joining him and when asked why-- gives the very Buddhist
response he learned from his master: "When two trails open in front of you,
Which one do you take?" The answer is "You always take the hardest one," the
implication being that there's more to learn on that path. </P>
<P>The film becomes in its second half an amazing visual spectacle and a challenge
to the filmmaker to record the earnest story in the most difficult of locations,
as it follows the two parties through the barren highland valleys and unsafe
mountain passes. </P>
<P>It's a testament to the spirit and courage of these followers of Tibetan
culture, who strive to carry on the traditions. It's ultimately a film about
finding out who you are and about living in harmony with nature. I enjoyed it
immensely and believe this rare film will be remembered for the simplicity of
its very human story and the deep respect it has for a way of life that is
endangered. If it wasn't a more penetrating look at the Nepal villagers and
their superstitions and if the drama wasn't more subtle--so be it! That might be
the task of another filmmaker. What this film did was show us a way of life that
few have ever witnessed, and it did it in a spirited pictorial manner. </P>
