<PRE>                               PHILADELPHIA
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Although PHILADELPHIA could have been a better movie, more about
this latter, I really liked it, especially for Tom Hank's extremely
moving performance as someone dying of AIDS.  There are many parts of
the movie that I will remember for a long time, but most of all is the
courtroom scene where Tom Hanks testifies in his own behalf.  Hanks's
performance deserves an Oscar, but many other parts of that scene were
outstanding.  His makeup throughout the movie is chillingly realistic
especially how pale he looks at court.  I hate cute camera angles, but
the choice of having the camera tilted whenever it shows what Hanks is
seeing makes you feel sick too.  Overall, it really makes you think:
there but for the grace of God go I.</P>
<P>     There are two other excellent parts of the show.  The family,
especially his mother played by Joanne Woodward, is loving and stands
behind him without being judgmental and the characters in the family
are not overdrawn.  Another excellent scene is the costume ball.  You
can really see the love and the happiness even in times of trouble that
this group of gay friends have.  The script by Ron Nyswaner is
outstanding as is the directing by Jonathan Demme.  Demme is one of my
favorite directors.  His long repertoire of wonderful movies include:
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, MARRIED TO THE MOB, SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA, and my
personal favorite SOMETHING WILD.  I recommend you rent them all many
times.</P>
<P>     The movie could and should have been even better.  The homophobia
was over done.  The scene in the drug store where someone tried to pick
up Denzel Washington starts off fine, but then goes overboard, ditto
for the bar scene, Washington's home scene, etc.  Also, Washington's
character was not well written.  He started off hating gay people and
by the middle and end of the movie, it was unclear what he thought.</P>
<P>     Some scenes were totally ridiculous.  Chief among these was the
scene where Hanks has to babble a long soliloquy signifying nothing
while listening to Opera music.  Finally, both lawyers at the trial
were too low key for such an important case, and Mary Steenbergen was
terribly miscast as she frequently is.  Her script was so bad on the
other hand, you kind of had to kind of feel sorry for her.  She has a
very limited range of acting abilities, but seems to be cast in widely
differing roles.</P>
<P>     PHILADELPHIA runs 2:05 and given all of the material it covers, I
don't think it could be made much shorter.  It is rated PG-13 for its
serious themes.  I highly recommend this show to everyone over 12 and
award it *** 1/2.  Now, go see the movie.  The good parts are
excellent, and the bad parts can be ignored.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
