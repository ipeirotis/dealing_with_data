<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Paul Stephens (Christopher Collet) is a high school science whiz in
Ithaca, New York, where he lives with his recently divorced real estate
agent mother, Elizabeth (Jill Eikenberry). When the new scientist
arrives in town, the likable John Mathewson (Lithgow), he gets to lease
a condo through Paul's mother and starts to date her. To impress Paul
and win points with his mom, he takes him on a tour of the science
research lab he is in charge of, telling him about the research they do
in lasers, but Paul notices plutonium on the site and figures out that
this is where they build nuclear bombs. What he doesn't know is that Dr.
Mathewson has successfully experimented with building the most powerful
nuclear explosion ever and that he is working on a top secret project in
this plant to make this bomb as part of the U.S. weapon's system.</P>
<P>Perhaps bored, or eager to show off in front of his new girlfriend, the
very attractive and mischievious Jenny (Nixon), or maybe concerned about
the dangers a nuclear plant in his backyard poses for the community,
Paul decides to sneak into the science lab with Jenny's help during a
thunder storm, by stealing John's security clearance card he casually
keeps in the glove compartment of his car. It was difficult to believe
how their simple plan worked, but by pretending to have car trouble
Jenny distracted the security guard, while Paul gained entry to the
building and dismantled the automatic alarms and worked all the control
switches in the few minutes he would need to steal the plutonium, doing
it as efficiently as if he were a scientist who worked there for years
and knew the lab like he did the palm of his hand. He gets the plutonium
out of the building by outthinking the guard and anticipating all his
moves.</P>
<P>When at home, he goes to work immediately building a nuclear bomb in
secret. Of course, it is impossible to believe that in such a tight
security complex, holding plutonium for a top secret project, that they
wouldn't notice it missing right away and take action.</P>
<P>Paul's plan is to enter the New York State science fair for high school
students in New York City and instead of showing an experiment on
hampsters as he announced, he will show his nuclear bomb.</P>
<P>He also builds a relationship with Mathewson based on their mutual
interest in science, as Mathewson is shown in a very human light,
someone who is primarily interested in chasing after his cute mom and
who is working on the project not because he is a military advocate but
because it stimulates his intellect.</P>
<P>What works best in the film is the sweet relationship between Jenny and
Paul, as she wants to write an expose on the nuclear plant for Rolling
Stone Magazine, telling Paul they can be like Woodward and Bernstein
whom he has never heard of. He wants to join the restrictive nuclear
club of the U.S., The Soviet Union, China, England, and France, which
would  now include Paul Stephens, the only private citizen entry. He
assumes this will happen once he displays the bomb at the science fair
and he also thinks, what could they do to me if I'm caught, I'm just a
kid!</P>
<P>At the fair, the film breaksdown into a madcap thriller. Unfortunately,
only a few of Marshall Brickman's funny pearls get into the script. He
is Woody Allen's former screenwriter. The one line I liked the best, is
when Lithgow is warning the kid about how tough the government agents
could be when they grill you: "They'll lock you in a room and then
they'll throw away the room." Another great line comes from Collet,
while realizing the danger there is in what he is doing, he tells Jenny,
"You always have a future, even if you get killed."</P>
<P>When Paul is stopped from exhibiting his experiment at the fair by the
FBI, he flees back to Ithaca, and the security forces led by Lieutenant
Colonel Conroy (Mahoney), plan to kill him in order to get the bomb back
and, hopefully, to keep what they are doing a secret. The tense scene
back in the science lab consists of all the usual melodramatics seen in
most typical action films, but what makes this film a little bit
different, is that there have actually been seven fatalities at nuclear
plants across America, even though this information is not widely known
by the public. These incidents involved scientists carrying plutonium
that discharged because the mixtures weren't right. I use as my source
of reference, for this information, Dr. Michio Kaku, Professor of
Theoretical Physics, at CCNY. So even if the film sunk rapidly into the
pits of a pointless preachy exercise about nuclear dangers, there still
was something absorbing about these nuclear scientists seen doing their
job. And it was, at least, not one of those awful summer teenager
movies. In fact, the acting was quite good in spots, especially, by
Christopher Collet; he convinced me he was a smart kid, while John
Lithgow convinced me that he was a scientist with a warm heart.</P>
