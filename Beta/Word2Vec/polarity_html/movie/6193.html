<P>     When two films as thematically similar as TREES LOUNGE and
PALOOKAVILLE appear virtually on top of one another, you have to take a
look around at the society which inspired them.  Americans have always
rooted for underdogs, but usually they like their underdogs to come out on
top.  What do we make of a pair of movies, both set in the Tri-State area,
which turn mere economic survival as an act of heroism?  TREES LOUNGE and
PALOOKAVILLE may be responses to an urban America where desperation is de
rigeur, but both films struggle to make black comedy out of bleak tragedy,
largely because they take our sympathies for granted.</P>
<P>     TREES LOUNGE, which marks the writing and directing debut of Steve
Buscemi, finds the erstwhile supporting actor playing the lead role of
Tommy Basilio, a man who has lost his job as a mechanic, his long-time
girlfriend Theresa (Elizabeth Bracco) and his way in the world.
Unemployed and unmotivated, Tommy spends his days and nights drowning his
sorrows at the Trees Lounge, a run-down watering hole where the other
regulars are almost as bad off as he is.  Among them is Mike (Mark Boone
Junior), who escapes from his apparently successful business and family at
the Trees, and Bill (Bronson Dudley), a lost soul who keeps his cash on
the bar to keep the drinks coming.  When Tommy finally gets a job
opportunity driving the ice cream truck left behind by his deceased uncle,
he is distracted by Debbie (KIDS' Chloe Sevigny), Theresa's 17-year-old
niece who is looking for an escape of her own.</P>
<P>     There is a detached verisimilitude to the people and situations in
TREES LOUNGE -- the indulgent bartender (Carol Kane); the barroom
conversations where strangers become best friends or lovers in the space
of a few hours -- which keeps it just interesting enough to earn the
benefit of the doubt for a while.  Buscemi gives his characters full
histories, and peppers the film with quirky moments like the repeatedly
thwarted efforts of one young boy to buy ice cream, yet the payoffs are
rather unsatisfying.  TREES LOUNGE cruises along, building up atmosphere
like a film in search of a Tom Waits soundtrack, but when it is all said
and done you might wonder what Buscemi wanted us to make of his cast of
not-so-beautiful losers.  Although he manages to get you interested in
what _might_ happen to them, he is not as successful at getting you to
care about what _does_ happen to them.</P>
<P>     That's more than you can say about the palookas in PALOOKAVILLE.  The
story involves three best friends -- Russ (Vincent Gallo), Sid (William
Forsythe) and Jerry (Adam Trese) -- all of whom are facing tough economic
times.  Russ is living at home with his mother, sister and brother-in-law;
Jerry has a child and a wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton) who is about to lose her
job at a supermarket; Sid and his dogs face eviction at any moment.
Together they decide that all they need to get back on their feet is a
"momentary shift in lifestyle"...more specifically, one big robbery.
While they plan for that big score, they struggle with relationships and
with half-hearted attempts to make legitimate money.</P>
<P>     PALOOKAVILLE was inspired by a collection of short stories (by
Italian writer Italo Calvino), and it feels every bit of it.  Director
Alan Taylor flits back and forth between episodes like Sid's budding
romance with a clerk at a used furs store (Bridgit Ryan) and the friends'
failed effort at starting a shuttle service for elderly shoppers, but he
never manages to unify them.  There is a real lack of narrative momentum
in PALOOKAVILLE, as stories bob and weave around the characters, giving
them just enough personality (Jerry's sweet tooth, Sid's soft spot for
dogs) to make it evident that they needed more.  Kim Dickens has a few
nice moments as Russ's young girlfriend, but our three protagonists are
never quite as sympathetic as they are pathetic.</P>
<P>     I suppose that is what makes PALOOKAVILLE even more disappointing
than TREES LOUNGE:  writer David Epstein seems to assume that we will feel
for his characters simply because they are in financial trouble.  There
are moments in PALOOKAVILLE when its serious turns make it clear that
there is a Statement About Desperate Times lurking beneath the attempts at
gallows humor, yet there is little effort to show that the predicaments of
Jerry, Sid and Russ are beyond their control.  In TREES LOUNGE, Tommy at
least comes to an understanding that he is partly responsible for his own
troubles, and that his preferred cure for those troubles may be even
worse; as sluggish as it may be, it does take Tommy on a journey of 
growth.  PALOOKAVILLE makes the mistake of asking us to identify with
three men who don't even seem to be trying, who surrender at any sign of
difficulty.  Yes, it's rough out there, as both TREES LOUNGE and
PALOOKAVILLE do an adequate job of presenting, but most of us already know
that.  Social consciousness still requires a story, and characters with a
motivation to make themselves -- and not just their bank accounts --
better.</P>
<PRE>     TREES LOUNGE:  6.
     PALOOKAVILLE:  3.</PRE>
