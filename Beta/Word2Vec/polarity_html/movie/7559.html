<P>     Welcome to Hell's Kitchen:  a part of New York City that's not on 
many visitors' tour maps.  Hell's Kitchen the quintessential inner city:  
no one has any money, crime is rampant, and everyone dreams of getting 
out.  It makes a great backdrop for a motion picture, provided that you 
want your story to be set against a world of poverty, violence, and drug 
abuse.  Since that's precisely what first-time film makers Alex and 
Sylvia Sichel were after, Hell's Kitchen is the perfect setting for 
their debut, ALL OVER ME.</P>
<P>     When we're growing up, all of us (boys as well as girls) have a 
best friend.  It's how we survive adolescence -- having someone to talk 
to, share experiences with, and traverse the mysterious road to 
adulthood alongside.  Many of these friendships don't survive, because, 
as we begin to unearth our identity and come to terms with who we really 
are, we often find ourselves growing apart from those with whom we were 
once inseparable.  This issue is at the heart of ALL OVER ME, a coming-
of-age story that explores what one girl gains and loses as she fights 
to unlock the mystery of her true self.</P>
<P>     At the center of ALL OVER ME is Claude (Alison Folland), a slightly 
overweight, somewhat insecure fifteen year old whose whole life revolves 
around her best friend, Ellen (Tara Subkoff).  But, even as Claude is 
beginning to recognize that her feelings for Ellen may run deeper than 
friendship, Ellen becomes involved with a local drug dealer/bad boy, 
Mark (Cole Hauser), and, suddenly, Claude's importance in Ellen's life 
plummets.  To fill the void, Claude begins exploring new relationships -
- a casual acquaintanceship with Luke (Pat Briggs), a gay musician who 
moves in downstairs, and a tentative friendship with a lesbian guitar 
player (Leisha Hailey).  Through it all, Claude realizes that what she 
wants more than anything is to recapture her closeness with Ellen, but a 
series of events in Hell's Kitchen may make that goal impossible to 
achieve.</P>
<P>     Part of the reason ALL OVER ME possesses such a stark sense of 
realism is because of the keenly-observed, unaffected performances of 
the lead actors.  Alison Folland, who attracted attention for her role 
as a troubled teen in TO DIE FOR, is exceptionally strong, realizing all 
of the angst and conflict churning within Claude.  As Ellen, Tara 
Subkoff has a less demanding part, but is no less effective in it.  
Ellen isn't as fully developed as her best friend, but Subkoff is called 
upon to present a character trapped in a cycle of drug and alcohol 
abuse.  The supporting cast includes Cole Hauser as the irredeemably 
nasty Mark, veteran actress Ann Dowd as Claude's mother, singer Leisha 
Hailey (of the group The Murmurs) as Claude's would-be lesbian 
girlfriend, and Psychotica band member Pat Briggs as the sensitive Luke.</P>
<P>     The setting and music of ALL OVER ME play an important part in 
developing the story.  These elements don't just function as background, 
but are integral to Claude's life choices.  As uncertain as she is about 
her sexual identity, there is one thing she's sure of -- that she loves 
playing the guitar.  Her dream has been to start a band with Ellen, but, 
when that is no longer possible, she is forced to consider the 
likelihood that their futures will diverge and that their irreplaceable 
friendship will become a memory.</P>
<P>     ALL OVER ME falls loosely into the same genre as last year's GIRLS 
TOWN -- entirely-believable stories of the troubles faced by girls 
growing up in a '90s inner city environment.  Contrast that with 
Hollywood's approach to the same subject matter, as demonstrated in 
unconvincingly melodramatic productions like last year's FOXFIRE.  The 
strength of this movie is that, with all the truth inherent in the 
story, it could easily be depicting the life of someone we might pass on 
the street.  And that makes it very easy to care about Claude, Ellen, 
and what happens to them during a few short summer weeks in Hell's 
Kitchen.</P>
