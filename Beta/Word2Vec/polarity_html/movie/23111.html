<P>Most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like "Toy Story 2" does.
Far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little.
Is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors?
Thankfully, "Toy Story 2" is a wonderful exception. I can't remember the
last time I saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one. It's
yet another sign that Pixar, the acclaimed animation studio behind "Toy
Story" and "A Bug's Life," is still at the top of its game.</P>
<P>Woody and Buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit "Toy Story," and
things have changed a bit since the last one ended. Woody (voiced by Tom
Hanks) is preparing to leave with his owner Andy for cowboy camp. In his
absence, he has assigned Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), now comfortable in his
role as a toy, to take charge. Unfortunately, Woody's trip is ruined when he
is accidentally put into the family garage sale, and is stolen by an
over-zealous toy collector (Wayne Knight). Off to save him are Buzz and
members of the old "toy gang," including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex
the nervous dinosaur (Wallace Shawn), Hamm the piggy bank (John
Ratzenberger), and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney). While in captivity, Woody makes
a startling discovery: he is actually part of a collection of toys based on
a 1950's children's show entitled "Woody's Roundup." He meets the show's
other characters, which include Jesse (Joan Cusack), his cowgirl sidekick,
the wise old Prospector (Kelsey Grammer), and Bullseye, his trusty horse.
They have all been anxiously awaiting Woody's arrival, as once their set is
completed, they will be sold to a Japanese toy museum, and finally escape
storage forever. This means Woody now faces a difficult choice. With his
friends coming to rescue him, does he go with them and spend a few more
years with Andy, or does he go to Japan and be immortalized forever?</P>
<P>As in the original film, "Toy Story 2" contains first-rate animation, and
Pixar Studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work
they did there. Reportedly, the film was originally slated for a
direct-to-video release, but after seeing the improvements that had been
made, Disney rightly decided to release it into theaters. The film is well
worth seeing on the big screen. The colors are bright, the textures sharp,
and even the human characters look more "human." The animation is
consistently seamless, with the action fast and furious and the facial
expressions believable. There are so many impressive sequences that I'd find
it impossible to list them here, but I was particularly wowed by a scene
where Buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to Al'
s Toy Barn, the store owned by Woody's captor. Pixar's rendition of the
family dog is also nicely done, with fur so realistic you almost feel you
could reach out and touch it.</P>
<P>The voice work is also perfectly complementary, and as with the first movie,
does much to help further character development. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen
again disappear into their roles as Woody and Buzz, making you forget who is
doing the voice. It was Woody and Buzz up there, not Tom and Tim. All the
cast members from the original reprise their roles, and each is excellent.
Several new voices have been added, with Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, and
Wayne Knight doing fine work. "Toy Story 2" is strong in characterization,
and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie. Woody faces
difficult choices, while Buzz is confronted with a new Buzz who hasn't yet
realized his status as a toy, forcing him to see what he used to be like.
The new characters are also developed quite well, especially Jesse, who
narrates a Sarah McLachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved,
then forgotten by her owner. It may be computer-animated, and it may have
sappy music, but it's downright touching.</P>
<P>The script, despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four
different writers, is endlessly clever and inventive, especially considering
that it's a sequel. The reason "Toy Story 2" works where other movie sequels
fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by
re-doing the same story and using the same characters. Not this one. We get
character change, new characters, and new issues brought up. "Toy Story 2"
is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself. There
is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here. The humor
is sharp and witty, with something to amuse both kids and adults. There are
funny asides to films such as "Star Wars" and "Jurassic Park," among others,
new takes on classic toys like Barbie and Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, and
appearances from other Pixar efforts "A Bug's Life" and the 1997 short "Geri
's Game." (Geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes
Woody's broken arm.) The action is fast and furious, and the chases (in the
street, in a toy store, in an elevator, on a baggage carousel, and in an
airplane) keep getting bigger and better. "Toy Story 2" never grows
stagnant, because there is always something new to hold your interest. The
more you pay attention to it, the more rewarding it is.</P>
<P>It's rare to see a film like "Toy Story 2" come along, because it's the kind
of film that's almost impossible to dislike. It's created purely to
entertain, and though I enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next
person, it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what
movies first tried to do: send us out with a smile. It's a fair bet that the
whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing "Toy
Story 2." It's the rare sequel that manages to expand on, and live up to,
the original.</P>
