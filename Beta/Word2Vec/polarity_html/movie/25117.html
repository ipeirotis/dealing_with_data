<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>We know we are watching a Shaft movie without even looking up at the
screen, as we tune into the wah-wah funk sound of Isaac Hayes'
exponential title theme and get with its raucous sounds that echo
throughout this action-packed mainstream movie from the opening credits
to the film's end. John Singleton's ("Boyz N the Hood") "Shaft" is a
blaxploitation sequel film to the core, made in earnest for the urban
New Millennium and to satisfy its fans who have followed all the other
Shaft films. Why do we need another "Shaft," is easy to explain: the
public demands it, meaning there's big box office potential.</P>
<P>Samuel L. Jackson brings the right frame of mind to the film as NYC
Detective John Shaft; he is funny, violent, and able to stay in
character as Samuel L. Jackson, staring hard at the camera, hamming it
up with an easy smile or taking on a drug lord in a choreographed
showdown of violence. Jackson's the Man who takes charge of this film,
because he's the Man. His humor is of the vulgar kind, where he tells a
barmaid, "It's my duty to please the booty." His violence is exemplified
with him coming out of a witnesses' private house with both guns blazing
and with dead bodies strewn all over the neighborhood. The original
Shaft, Richard Roundtree, has a small part as Shaft's uncle, trying to
get his nephew to become a partner in his private eye service and give
up on the racist police force.</P>
<P>The film has its two eyes firmly set on the box office, its mind in the
gutter, and a serviceable script for all its mayhem and profanity to
have an urban gritty feel to it. The film makes only a few halfhearted
pretences of being anything more than a mindless entertainment
spectacle, and those efforts don't help but hinder. The film would have
been better served if went completely either for mindless violence or
played it completely like a Scorsese art-form gangster film. Mixing in
both styles, only jarred the rhythm of the film.</P>
<P>"Shaft" has the usual props for a black exploitation film: fancy cars,
gold chains, sexy chicks, drugs, guns, crooked cops, and a slick
anti-establishment hero. It also had the audience where I saw the film,
charged-up for the action scenes and hooting with wild delight at the
snide digs. It also had the right Shaft for the part; Samuel L. Jackson
gives the role some weight and puts an edge on his vigilante
characterization.</P>
<P>The action begins when Shaft gets called to a racially charged murder
outside a trendy Manhattan nightspot, and he arrests a bigoted, rich,
white young man, Walter Wade Jr. (Bale). But the rich kid posts bail and
skips for two years, living in Switzerland. The barmaid Diane (Colleti),
with her frightened doe-like eyes in the headlights for the entire film,
also disappears, and she is the only witness to the crime.</P>
<P>Walter returns after two years and Shaft arrests him again. The judge
this time sets a high bail, but one which Walter easily meets. In the
tombs for a day, waiting to post bail, he befriends a violent Dominican
drug dealer called Peoples (Wright). In a scene that was both
incredulous and awesome in how chilling it was, Walter goes to Peoples'
Dominican Washington Heights neighborhood, where he sticks out like a
sore thumb and offers Peoples $40,000 in his late mother's jewelry to
locate and kill the witness. Peoples' has other ideas than the money, he
wants to get his drugs pushed into Walter's white upscale neighborhood,
as he is looking for upward mobility and a white contact there. Of
course, one can ask why a racist like Walter would go to Peoples for the
contract murder, unless he's really insane and that the "American
Psycho" smile Bale still sports from his last starring role, just hasn't
worn off yet. It is more than likely, especially with the big money he
was willing to pay, that he could have gotten white Mafia professionals
to take care of his business.</P>
<P>The meeting of great minds, of the hateful WASP Walter and the
stereotyped lowlife Peoples, who speaks a stream of constant trash-talk
and with an enunciation that is so fantastically off kilter, that makes
it fun to laugh at him. The comedy provided by Wright's speech pattern
is comparable to a Cisco Kid movie dialogue, if the two stars were on
speed. Jeffrey Wright is the perfect villain to balance out the
super-serious Shaft; he steals scenes from his arch enemy Shaft by a
twist of his neck or by wearing a greasy shirt. After all, Samuel L.
Jackson is just playing one of those typical ego-maniac roles.</P>
<P>Shaft throws his badge at the judge who gave Walter an attainable bail
again, and quits the police force to become a vigilante, dedicating his
life in hunting down the crime's key witness and getting Walter
convicted. His role is very serious. While Peoples just wants to become
a bigger drug kingpin...realizing he's limited in this lifetime by his
ethnic quirks.</P>
<P>Shaft gets unexpected help in his vigilante stance from the attractive
narcotics squad detective, Carman Vasquez (Williams), who watches his
back. He will need her help, as things get twisted and two crooked cops
(Hedaya and Tergesen) who work for Peoples, tail him as he goes after
Diane. The film resorts to violent chases, shootouts, a final duel
between Wright and Jackson, and a twisted ending, to make its final
statement about what Singleton thinks of the justice system.</P>
<P>Shaft tells it like it is, he's: "too black for the uniform, too blue
for the brothers." He's angry at racism, and he's angry at urban crime
and corruption. The Shaft films have changed with the times, the 1970s
demanded "Black Pride," for Shaft to be a sex machine, and for him to be
one cool dude. This Shaft retains the loud dress code, his super-macho
attitude, and the political incorrectness of his character, but he is
more politically motivated, more set on violence as his calling card,
and even more cynical that the system can't work. It is stylishly
directed and acted, and achieves moderate success in telling its story.
It even offers some passing comments about a host of recent NYC police
corruption cases, and it can't resist a passing aside at the current
mayor, as Jackson in the middle of an assault on the drug dealers says,
"It's Giuliani time."This film was made for Samuel L. Jackson; just by
his presence, it makes this film a more perplexing one than the others.
What is missing  is any love interest or any sex scenes; what takes the
place of sex, is pure violence. You tell me if that's an improvement!</P>
