<PRE>                             FOR LOVE OR MONEY
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1993 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Michael J. Fox, Gabrielle Anwar, Anthony Higgins.
Screenplay:  Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner.
Director:  Barry Sonnenfeld.

<P>     Michael J. Fox is in a *deep* rut.  While he's made the occasional
stab at drama (LIGHT OF DAY, CASUALTIES OF WAR), Fox has basically
seemed content to play the character he perfected on "Family Ties:" The
Cocky Young Go-Getter Who Learns a Lesson about What Really Matters.
It's a type that has worked for him, thanks to his charm and comic
timing, but it puts him in danger of carrying questionable projects
which seem comfortable.  As a perfect example, witness FOR LOVE OR
MONEY, a cliche-filled would-be romantic comedy that's neither
particularly romantic nor particularly funny.</P>
<P>     This time around, Fox's Cocky Young Go-Getter is named Doug
Ireland, concierge at the posh Manhattan hotel The Bradbury.  His
specialty is doing that little something extra for the guests--walking
their dogs, acquiring hard-to-get theater tickets--and raking in huge
tips for his efforts.  These tips have gone into a deposit on Doug's
dream, his own luxury hotel, but making that dream a reality will
require another $5 million.  Enter financier Christian Hanover (Anthony
Higgins), who's willing to exchange helping Doug with his hotel with
Doug helping him carry on an affair.  The catch:  Hanover's mistress is
Andy (Gabrielle Anwar), an aspiring singer who works at the Bradbury's
perfume counter and for whom Doug is carrying a torch.  As the two
spend more time together, a mutual attraction develops, forcing Doug to
decide whether he's willing to sacrifice Hanover's money for Andy's
love.</P>
<P>     If you have to guess which choice Doug will make, you haven't seen
very many romantic comedies.  The point is never whether they'll end up
together, but simply how entertaining getting there will be.
Unfortunately, the answer in FOR LOVE OR MONEY is, not very.  It starts
promisingly enough, with a focus on Doug's wheeling and dealing, but
once the romantic plot kicks in there's just no energy.  There's a
lengthy sequence at a party involving mistaken identities and Doug
trying to hold everything together which was frantic but never really
clicked; after that, the film doesn't even seem to try.  The situations
are simply tedious.  I can't begin to describe how tired I am of that
stock "we both care about each other but neither one of us will admit
it so instead we'll yell at each other" scene in romantic comedies.
There are plenty of ways to establish conflict that actually occur in
human life (or perhaps I and everyone I know have just been lucky so
far).  FOR LOVE OR MONEY uses up most of its best jokes and all of its
originality in about ten minutes.</P>
<P>     I also had many problems with the performances.  Fox has spent so
much time as the Cocky Young Go-Getter that he doesn't seem to know how
to vary it.  He's too likable too soon; FOR LOVE OR MONEY would have
worked much better if a man who had seen more than his share of kept
women had initially been more cynical and antagonistic towards Andy.
He also never conveys when the mild flirtation established early in
their interaction becomes real romantic interest, but perhaps a better
question than "when" is "why." Gabrielle Anwar wanders through the film
gorgeous but thoroughly uninteresting, emoting and pouting in ways that
would make a high school drama teacher cringe.  Of the supporting
players, only Michael Tucker as a nebbishy hotel guest is not a
complete stereotype.  Particularly embarrassing are fascistic German
hotel manager and a swishy fashion designer, but they are just the most
glaring examples of a script that makes all the easy choices, and all
the wrong ones.</P>
<P>     Director Barry Sonnenfeld was a marvelous cinematographer
(MILLER'S CROSSING), but so far only a barely serviceable director.
Like THE ADDAMS FAMILY, FOR LOVE OR MONEY is too ham-fisted, and
Sonnenfeld's few stylistic flourishes are lost in slow pacing and
mishandled actors.  FOR LOVE OR MONEY turns out to be ALEX KEATON - THE
CONCIERGE YEARS, an overlong mid-grade sitcom.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 big tips:  3.</PRE>
