<P>     Before FEMALE PEVERSIONS, I never thought of Tilda Swinton=20
(ORLANDO) as possessing much sexual allure.  Her performance here, the=20
best thing about this sporadically effective exploration of sexuality=20
and gender roles, has convinced me otherwise.  With her finely-chiseled=20
features, alabaster skin, and ruby red lips, she radiates eroticism,=20
whether she's wearing a designer suit, transparent neglig=E9e, or nothing=20
at all.  If there's a reason to see FEMALE PERVERSIONS, it's Swinton.</P>
<P>     Had this film been directed by a man, I would have been tempted to=20
call it soft porn, but, since there's a woman (Susan Streitfeld) putting=20
all the naked female flesh up on screen, it seems a little less=20
exploitative.  Besides, there are times when the nudity is important to=20
the script, and FEMALE PERVERSIONS is nothing if not rich in ideas.  In=20
fact, that's part of the problem.  The movie is so focused on presenting=20
its agenda that it frequently lapses into pretentiousness.  The=20
characters don't always speak dialogue; occasionally, they start=20
mouthing slogans.  And there's some embarrassingly heavy-handed dream=20
imagery that features a naked woman being bound after falling off a=20
tightrope.</P>
<P>     FEMALE PERVERSIONS is inspired by FEMALE PERVERSIONS: THE=20
TEMPTATIONS OF EMMA BOVARY, an non-fiction book by feminist Louise J.=20
Kaplan.  There are times when Streitfeld tries a little too hard to get=20
Kaplan's points into the film, and the result is less-than-successful. =20
A pillow has the following phrase on it:  "Perversions are never what=20
they seem to be."  A television has this caption crawling across the=20
bottom of the screen: "Perversion keeps despair, anxiety, and depression=20
at bay."  And a roadside bench offers the message: "In a perversion,=20
there is no freedom, only a rigid conformity to stereotype."  I'm not=20
sure what all of this means, but, despite the unsubtle manner in which=20
the ideas are presented, it's impossible to deny that FEMALE PERVERSIONS=20
says provocative things.=20</P>
<P>     Swinton plays Eve Stephens, an aggressive attorney who's up for an=20
open position on the Court of Appeals.  From the outside, Eve appears to=20
have everything -- she's a smart, powerful, attractive go-getter whose=20
career is on the rise and whose love-life would be the envy of many=20
professional women.  She knows how to use her body to get what she wants=20
-- her cleavage and subtle body language are as much a part of her=20
closing arguments as are her words.  Deep-down, however, Eve is=20
troubled.  She is haunted by feelings of inadequacy, has recurring=20
visions of herself failing, experiences nightmares of a violent=20
confrontation between her parents, and hears babbling voices.  One of=20
those voices, referring to her use of sexuality to sway opinion in her=20
favor, comments: "Nothing about you is genuine.  Everyone knows you're a=20
fraud."  Driven ever closer to the line between madness and sanity, Eve=20
begins taking risks in every aspect of her life.</P>
<P>     It's a good thing that Eve is such an interesting character,=20
because no one else in FEMALE PERVERSIONS is better than paper-thin. =20
Each of the other females represents some aspect of womanhood.  Amy=20
Madigan's Madelyn is the intellectual asexual, Laila Robbins' Emma is=20
the insecure submissive, Frances Fisher's Annunciata is the seductress,=20
and Karen Sillas' Renee is the lesbian.  Unfortunately, these=20
individuals aren't just described by their characteristics -- they're=20
defined by them, and that makes FEMALE PERVERSIONS' entire supporting=20
population profoundly uninteresting. =20</P>
<P>     Ultimately, FEMALE PERVERSIONS is frustratingly incomplete.  As a=20
character study, it has flashes of brilliance, but strong ideas, erotic=20
sex scenes, and a lot of naked flesh can't make up for the lack of a=20
compelling story.  In a way, this film reminded me of KAMA SUTRA; the=20
two share a number of similarities.  Both feature attractive main=20
performers, have a lot to say about gender and sexuality, and lack a=20
strong narrative.  The one advantage FEMALE PERVERSIONS has is Tilda=20
Swinton, but she can't quite tip the balance in the movie's favor. =20
FEMALE PERVERSIONS is often too pretentious to be profound.</P>
