<P>     It probably says as much about me as it does about BIG NIGHT that I
consider it a remarkably insightful film about the state of contemporary
film-making.  Yes, BIG NIGHT is about food, and it is about the
relationship between two brothers, and it is about what it means to
participate in the American dream as well.  However, I think BIG NIGHT is
something particularly special for anyone who loves movies because of what
they can be.  It is a warm, engaging and extremely funny film which
manages not simply to describe the battle between art and commerce, but to
win it on behalf of the former.</P>
<P>     BIG NIGHT takes place in a Jersey shore town of the 1950s, where
brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo Pilaggi (Stanley Tucci) run an
Italian restaurant called the Paradise.  Business is anything but
heavenly, though, as master chef Primo's insistence upon creating daring
traditional cuisine has not created the booming clientele enjoyed by the
Americanized bistro across the street, run by Pascal (Ian Holm).  Two
years of poor receipts have placed the Paradise on the brink of
foreclosure, but Pascal offers Primo a last chance.  Pascal suggests
inviting band leader Louie Prima, a personal friend, to dine at the
Paradise and create a media event which will boost business.  With nothing
to lose, Primo and Secondo throw everything they have left into one big
night, a sumptuous dinner which will either make them or break them.</P>
<P>     Stanley Tucci co-wrote (with his cousin Joseph Tropiano) and
co-directed with actor Campbell Scott) BIG NIGHT in addition to starring
in it, and he has created one of the year's most delightful character
studies.  His own character of Secondo is the film's central figure, but
all three main characters are superbly written and acted.  Tony Shalhoub
(TV's "Wings") is hilarious as Primo, whose passion for his cooking leads
to fits of pique over the "Philistines" who cannot appreciate his work,
but who has difficulty showing that passion to the florist (Allison
Janney) he secretly pines for.  Ian Holm has a tasty, showy role as the
unapologetically assimilated Pascal, who runs his restaurant like a
circus; Holm's accent is hit-and-miss, but his truly unprintable favorite
epithet for Secondo actually gets funnier every time he uses it.  Between
them is Secondo, with Tucci doing solid, subtle work as an immigrant
trying to navigate the treacherous course between tradition and
assimilation without committing fully to either one, but tending towards
his vision of the American dream.  His mockery of Primo's more broken
English begins as good-natured, but gradually it becomes indicative of
Secondo's frustration with his brother's steadfast refusal to compromise.</P>
<P>     It is this conflict which makes BIG NIGHT such a potent metaphor for
cinema in the 1990s.  Primo is an artist unwilling to compromise even if
it means alienating potential customers; Pascal is the capitalist who
believes that "if a guy wants a steak, you give him a steak."  Secondo
wants to have it both ways, to be the artist and the capitalist, but when
push comes to shove he finds himself more willing to compromise on the
art.  What BIG NIGHT ultimately argues is that somewhere along the line,
you have to choose between doing the work you know will make you proud and
doing the work you know will make you rich.  There is room for both, Tucci
suggests, but the greatest satisfaction comes from people loving the best
you had to give them.</P>
<P>     But whether you see BIG NIGHT as a simple tale of brotherly conflict
and fine dining or as a meditation on art as a consumer product, you
should see BIG NIGHT, because film-making simply doesn't get much more
satisfying.  Tucci, Scott and company have put together a banquet of
finely drawn characters, smart dialogue and assured direction, culminating
in an elaborate meal which might inspire you to the same conclusion which
leads one character to utter one of the year's best punch lines.  It also
ends with a wordless single take in which resolution is achieved with such
grace, simplicity and emotion that you could find yourself smiling all the
way out the door.  Primo states his believe in one scene that great food
is what "brings us closest to God," but that could be true of any true
work of art.  With BIG NIGHT, Stanley Tucci and a host of gifted
contributors have served up a small piece of Paradise.</P>
