<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A seaplane crash lands on the waters of some deserted South Pacific
Island and the six diverse passengers plus the pilot and the stewardess
on board remove themselves from the wreck and take a dinghy ashore,
where they will find things look hopeless and could be getting worse.</P>
<P>The pilot, Jack Bennett (Gregson), is a disgruntled man, carrying on a
futile love affair with the attractive stewardess, Teresa (Pier Angeli),
and is dissatisfied with this second-rate airline he works for and with
his co-pilot, Willy (Linder). Willy is finding it difficult to follow
the captain's orders and rebels by doing whatever he wants to do. When
the plane makes a fuel stop and picks up some more passengers on a small
island, he doesn't get the proper amount of fuel the captain asks him to
get because he is anxious to get back to his home and quit this job he
dreads and he doesn't want to get stuck in this primitive island waiting
for the bureaucrats to finally grant him all the fuel needed. A
hurricane warning is issued, but because of the poor radio equipment
they have, which was not properly repaired by Willy, the message is cut
off and they don't know how serious that storm will be. But Willy's most
fatal mistake was to purchase fire extinguishers that were cheap, but
would comply in appearance with the air safety codes. It was purchased
at the price this airline run on a shoestring could afford, the only
trouble was that they were the wrong type of extinguishers for an
airplane, and if used, they can cause deadly fumes to be released rather
than extinguish the fire. Of course, there was a fire on the plane and
the extinguisher was used by a passenger rushing into the cockpit to
help out and before he could be stopped by the co-pilot from using it,
the damage was done, as the fumes killed the co-pilot and knocked the
pilot unconscious.</P>
<P>The two original passengers from the flight are the prim and haughty
Englishwoman, Miss Shaw (Jean Anderson), who turns out to be a good egg,
after all, and a German physic's professor, Krauss (Gunnar), who is on
his way to Australia to accept a teaching position there.</P>
<P>Petersen (Clifford) is a cop on assignment to arrest the brash captain
of the Sea Spray, Mark (Eddie), for smuggling. His information that the
captain is a smuggler comes from the Britisher, the very slimy Whitey
(Attenborough), a weasel if there ever was one. Whitey is given an
airline ticket to testify in court against Mark, and if he does that, he
will then get his reward money. The handcuffed Mark, when he gets a
chance to be uncuffed by the cop who has to go to the bathroom,
threatens Whitey by telling him what will happen to him if he testifies
in court. This scares the living daylights out of the prevaricator. Mark
is the one who mistakenly used the fire extinguisher and was forced to
land the plane with the help of the revived pilot, who still had no
strength in his hands to navigate it.</P>
<P>Maria (Eva Bartok) is the popular bon vivant world traveler, where every
island she stops at is paradise. She is a romantic friend of Mark's but
can't get closer to him than that. Her role in the film is never
developed, as it is based on a generalization of what someone like her
should be like.</P>
<P>The marooned passengers discover that they are on an island that has
cattle in lead sheltered buildings and an empty fleet of ships docked
around the side of the island and they soon realize that this is an
island used as a nuclear-test site, and in a few hours a nuclear-test
bomb will explode on the island.</P>
<P>The physic's professor tells them that the next island they see, which
is two miles away, has the detonators that will cause the chain-reaction
for the bomb to go off and that if they can get to that island they can
stop the explosion from occurring. One of the problems, is that Whitey
is intimidated by Mark and doesn't like it that the cop has uncuffed his
prisoner, so when he gets a chance, he steals the cop's gun and the
plane's dinghy, taking it to the next island. The problem now, is that
the professor can't swim so he has to teach Mark how to detonate the
reactors. In the meantime, Teresa goes diving into the water to find the
toolbox in a search for the tools Mark will need to do his mission. She
nearly drowns doing this but is saved by Mark, and the two passionately
kiss on the beach. This kiss is seen by the dismayed pilot.</P>
<P>The film's ending is routine formula fare, with a few "predictable"
surprises of heroism and villainy, the kind of middling story churned
out regularly by the studios who lack the imagination to delve into
anything but superficial waters. So what you have is familiary  known as
a typical disaster B- movie, a precursor to all those other movies of
this genre that were very popular with audiences from the late '70s- on.
The film fits into the formula mold that studios use over and over
again, with the obligatory tense action scenes and the typical danger
scenes that call for a hero to be manufactured. In this film, Mark acts
as a hero and stops the bomb and the crash victims get rescued with two
seconds left, or something like that. You know what I mean, everyone who
watches films over the years will run across one like this one, which,
by the way, wasn't too bad of a film to watch. The actors had enough
vigor in them to keep it going, and the story seemed to move along at a
brisk and mindless pace.</P>
