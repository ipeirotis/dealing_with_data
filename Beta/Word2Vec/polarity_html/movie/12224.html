<P>     This is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate Disney's live-
action GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE.  TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY, the latest 
attempt to bring Edgar Rice Burrough's legendary hero to the big screen, 
is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any Tarzan adventure so far.  
Badly conceived and poorly executed, TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY appears 
headed for a quick trip to video store shelves.  I have no idea why the 
producers chose now to bring back Tarzan; it's not as if there are 
legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie.  Furthermore, it's 
even more curious that this film is rated PG, which, by definition, 
rules out any sex or explicit violence.  And, while I'm not advocating 
the excesses embraced by the 1981 Bo Derek version of the story, Tarzan 
deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the 
embarrassing production.</P>
<P>     Of course, no tweaking of the content to change the rating could 
have saved TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY, since the film's troubles 
originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the 
line.  Imagine GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE stripped of all (intentional) humor, 
and you have a fair idea of what this TARZAN is like.  With its 
uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences, the film barely 
registers a pulse.  Anyone in search of a relatively entertaining, 
family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of THE JUNGLE 
BOOK, which uses the same basic elements to much better effect.  The 
only worthwhile element of TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY is the pretty 
scenery (which, unfortunately, includes the two lead actors).</P>
<P>     The film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story – the thinking 
is that it has been done often enough.  Instead, TARZAN AND THE LOST 
CITY introduces us to Lord Graystoke a.k.a. John Clayton a.k.a. Tarzan 
the Ape Man (Casper Van Dien) several days before his marriage to Lady 
Jane Porter (Jane March).  He is living happily in England, enjoying the 
benefits of being a land-owning noble.  Meanwhile, in central Africa, 
the dastardly Nigel Ravens (Steven Waddington), a self-proclaimed 
scholar and explorer, believes he has found the way to the lost city of 
Opar, which he calls the cradle of civilization.  On the way there, he 
and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things, like burning 
native villages, to earn the wrath of the locals.  One shaman, 
determined to stop Ravens from unearthing Opal, sends a mystical message 
to Tarzan for help.  With Lady Jane following close behind, he returns 
to the jungle where he was born.</P>
<P>     Its patently obvious that Casper Van Dien (one of the pretty-boy 
heroes of STARSHIP TROOPERS) was not hired on the basis of his acting 
ability.  With his plastic facial expressions, monotone voice, and 
complete inability to make convincing animal noises, his range rivals 
that of Steven Seagal.  His pecs, however, are impressive, and director 
Carl Schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them 
off.  Jane March, on the other hand, has to keep her shirt on, which may 
be a first for her.  Some six years ago, March give a solid performance 
in Jean Jacques Annaud's steamy THE LOVER.  Since then, she made the 
career-killing decision of appearing opposite Bruce Willis in THE COLOR 
OF NIGHT, which exploited her every acting defiency.  TARZAN continues 
this trend.  March may be attractive, but, at least judging by this 
performance, she can't act.  Meanwhile, Steven Waddington has serious 
trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad 
guy.  Instead, he turns out to be little more than a nuisance.</P>
<P>     The story line is pure formula, which has largely been true 
throughout the years for almost all of the TARZAN movies.  The problem 
is that this one seems so childish and lifeless.  The romantic elements 
are all contrived – in fact, Lady Jane's presence is necessary only so 
she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance.  The 
special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel (including some laughably 
bad men in ape costumes – apparently, animatronics were too expensive 
for this production).  And, of course, as with all jungle movies, there 
are the obligatory cute animals.</P>
<P>     Over the years, the legend of Tarzan has been one of the most 
popular sources for film series material.  The most famous Ape Man was 
Johnny Weismuller, but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed 
the part (including Gordon Scott, who is widely believed to be the best 
actor to tackle the role).  Weismuller made 12 Tarzan features; Van Dien 
will probably fall 11 short of that number.  And, having seen TARZAN AND 
THE LOST CITY, I would argue that the movie-going public would have been 
well served if he had missed by 12.  </P>
