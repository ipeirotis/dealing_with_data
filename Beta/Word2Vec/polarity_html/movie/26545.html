<P>     I can't imagine a thoughtful movie lover watching ONE without
realizing that director Tony Barbieri -- a first-time filmmaker -- is in
complete command of visual storytelling. He does things veteran directors
by the score would shun out of simple fear, though they are likely the
best choices for the moment. He embraces a distinctive rhythm, and lets
his camera say things his characters can't say. This is neither a
flash-for-flash's-sake technical show-off, nor a man content to point his
lens at people while they exchange glib dialogue. ONE is a coming-out
party for a director to watch.</P>
<P>     I'd love to report that Barbieri's eye and his narrative restraint 
make ONE a must-see film, but it's possible to take narrative restraint to
an extreme. Barbieri also co-wrote the story of two childhood friends
facing turning points in their lives. Charlie O'Connell (Jason Cairns,
Barbieri's co-scripter) has just been paroled from a sentence for
assisting in his grandfather's suicide; Nick Razca (Kane Picoy), a
one-time sure-thing baseball prospect, is living with his parents and
working as a garbage collector. Charlie comes to stay with Nick while he
looks for a job, but the two friends seem to have different plans for
their lives. While Charlie returns to school and begins a relationship
with a woman named Sara (Autumn Macintosh), Nick deals with his own
feelings about his failed baseball career and the feelings of his father
(Paul Herman) on the same subject.</P>
<P>     The first thing anyone is likely to notice about ONE is that it
doesn't look or move like a typical film. Barbieri tells the story of
these lingering characters in lingering takes, with performances pitched
at a level of quiet resignation. His preferred composition places his
camera outside a doorway, with only one of the two characters involved in
the scene visible at any time. It's a device he uses perhaps to excess,
but he captures effectively the tension between people occupying the same
room while living in different worlds. Barbieri even makes the subtly
audacious choice in one scene to slowly blur the characters in a scene,
pulling the focus to an object in the foreground so gradually you may just
think your eyes are playing tricks on you. At virtually every moment, I
was fascinated by the prospect of what Barbieri might do next.</P>
<P>     The narrative itself, unfortunately, is not nearly so fascinating. 
It's not that the characters are not compelling; Barbieri and Cairns have
crafted a pair of enigmatic, lived-in roles in Charlie and Nick. ONE
simply suffers from a near-crippling case of "the muteds." Virtually every
emotion and every confrontation isn't just writ small, it's writ to the
point that you need a microscope to see it. Barbieri may have been aiming
for a style that feels real, but he seems scared to death of anything that
could be perceived as an emotional high point. He observes and observes
and observes -- skillfully, to be sure, but from such a distance that the
characters threaten to disappear at any moment. In his zeal to make ONE
feel real, Barbieri doesn't allow it to feel at all.</P>
<P>     Even with such a mega-subdued story, ONE is still strangely
watchable. The naturalistic performances are good; the arc of the two main
characters consistently interesting. But it's really about Barbieri's
knack for using his camera to create a mood. There are many skills that
make up a great director: facility with actors, pacing, and yes, setting
up the right shot for the right moment. In ONE, Barbieri makes it clear
that he needs little help with the latter. I can't wait for the film he
makes when he masters the other two.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 quiet ones:  6.</PRE>
