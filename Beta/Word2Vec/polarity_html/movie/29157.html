<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>This is the film noir that made Alan Ladd a hot star after many years as a
struggling actor. The film teamed him with his co-star, Veronica Lake, whom he
would successfully work together with for numerous other films during the 1940s.
It helped that they were both short and photographed well together. When the
film first came out, Ladd only received fourth billing. </P>
<P>Ladd plays Raven, a psychotic killer who never smiles and always wears a trench
coat. He's a victim of a terrible childhood, where his criminal father was
executed and his mother also died when he was young. While living with his
hostile aunt, the youngster was reaching for some chocolates that she wanted to
use to bake a cake--and to stop him she put a hot iron to his left wrist leaving
him permanently scarred. In return he slit her throat and spent the remainder of
his childhood in reform schools. What followed was a life of ruthless crimes. </P>
<P>The film opens in a dumpy San Francisco hotel room, where Raven goes bonkers and
slaps  and then rips the dress of the hotel maid when she chases a stray cat
away. He has an affinity for feeding stray cats because he considers them his
lucky charms and he admires how independent they are. After that incident he
hurries over to the apartment of a Mr. Baker, who is the paymaster in the
chemical firm of the person he is blackmailing. He shows Raven the documents
with formulas written on them and Raven shows him the money he's to get in
exchange, but Raven suddenly pulls a gun from out of his briefcase and in
cold-blood kills Baker and his secretary who had the bad luck of being in the
wrong place at the wrong time. </P>
<P>He has been hired to do the contract killing by a representative of the Los
Angeles-based chemical firm, the obese and unctuous Willard Gates (Cregor), who
is fond of peppermint candy and preying on women. Willard pulls a fast one and
pays Raven off in "hot money" as the boss, Brewster (Tully Marshall), of the
operation, a cripple who is wheelchair-bound, wants no loose ends left around to
connect him with a plot to sell poison gas to the Nazis. It's his hope that the
police can dispose of Raven, which is why he puts pressure on them to get Raven.</P>
<P>But Raven, when he finds out the money is marked, escapes the police and takes
the train to Los Angeles to get his revenge on Gates and his boss. Also on the
train is Ellen Graham (Lake), a cabaret performer who sings and has a magic act
and has been hired to work in Willard's L. A.  nightclub. She has been asked by
a senator to do her patriotic duty and spy for the government on Willard. The
feds suspect him and someone else in his firm of dealing with the enemy, but
need to get proof. As a coincidence, Ellen is engaged to the Los Angeles
detective, Michael Crane (Preston), who is hunting Raven down. </P>
<P>Ellen and Raven accidently sit next to each other on the train to L. A. and when
Willard spots them together, he assumes they are working together to get him. He
thereby wires the L. A. police to meet the train at the station, but Raven takes
Ellen as a hostage and escapes to the freight yards. He stays with Ellen till
the morning, and during that time she feels she understands him better after
talking with him. She talks him into acting patriotic and getting a confession
from the corrupt businessmen, which she says is more important than shooting
them. </P>
<P>The film's terse dialogue, atmospheric dark shots in the freight yards and the
snappy presentation of a very slight story when added on to Alan Ladd's menacing
and laconic performance, made this a solid example of what film noir is supposed
to be like. It helped establish a number of conventions and character types for
this genre. It was adapted from a Graham Greene story. </P>
