<PRE>DEATH WISH 3
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 1998</PRE>
<P>Fact that Charles Bronson represents one of the most
important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the
biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade. Tragedy
lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by
quality of his work in movies, but the quantity. Most of
those movies were produced by Cannon Group, company led by
Israeli producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus. Those two
men probably thought that they could be the next Roger
Corman, B- movie mentors of future Hollywood legends.
Unfortunately, that didn't happened, and when Cannon finally
went bankrupt at the end of the decade, behind it stood the
huge pile of cinematic garbage, that would require at least
few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal. Sadly for
Bronson, that garbage also contained numerous movies in
which that capable character actor and action hero of the
1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main
lead, and lowering his own reputation in process. On the
other hand, Bronson could take comfort in a fact that those
movies were extremely popular, especially among the audience
3 or 4 times younger than Bronson himself.</P>
<P>One of such movies that seriously marred Bronson's
reputation is DEATH WISH 3, third sequel in the series which
began with DEATH WISH in 1974. In the original movie,
Bronson played Paul Kersey, mild-mannered New York architect
who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell
victim to urban violence. That movie was far from
masterpiece; yet, in it the director Michael Winner was
skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real
disease of growing crime rates of the time (on the same
lines like Siegel in DIRTY HARRY). Unfortunately, six years
later Cannon Group got rights to the character of Paul
Kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels; even
the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid
decline of the quality. DEATH WISH 3 begins when Kersey
comes to visit an old friend, living in the urban wasteland
of East New York, populated by young criminals and people
too old or too poor to move out.  Before the reunion,
Kersey's friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil
Fraker (played by Gavan O'Herlihy, probably the only
noteworthy role in the film). Kersey decides to avenge his
death and slowly prepares for his crusade, while the police
inspector Shriker (Ed Lauter), ants to use him as a secret
weapon in his losing war against the urban crime.</P>
<P>Bronson, the main asset in this movie, plays the character
who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine.
Although Bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some
implausibilities (single man in his 60s and armed with a
single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with
superior firepower), the lack of emotions or Bronson's own
commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a
film. The movie authors were somewhat aware of that
emotional shallowness, so they added romantic interest for
their hero - public defender played by Deborah Raffin and
conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives
for Kersey's crusade. On the other hand, emotions are much
better played by confronting law-abiding, yet ethnically
stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street
punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on
the entire city blocks, and stupid enough to be killed in
droves by Kersey. Unfortunately, Michael Winner doesn't know
how to work out the plot, and after torturing the viewers
with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and
formulaic situations, ends this movie with a bang. The big
showdown at the end - that turns East New York into the
Sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of
the movie, because of the poor editing and the cheap sets
and props that give away the low budget.</P>
<P>In short, this movie could be recommended only to the most
fanatical Charles Bronson fans or for the people who are
already desperate for 1980s nostalgia.</P>
<P>(Special note for trekkies: Marina Sirtis, the actress who
played Counsellor Deanna Troi in STAR TREK: THE NEXT
GENERATION could be spotted in a small role of Portorican
wife).</P>
