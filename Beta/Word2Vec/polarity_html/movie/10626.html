<PRE>MOUSE HUNT</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: *** (out of ****) </PRE>
<P>DreamWorks SKG / 1:37 / 1997 / PG (language, slapstick violence, comic
 sensuality)
Cast: Nathan Lane; Lee Evans; Christopher Walken; Vicki Lewis; Eric Christmas; 
Maury Chaykin; William Hickey 
Director: Gore Verbinski 
Screenplay: Adam Rifkin </P>
<P>Mickey Mouse had better watch his back -- there's a new critter in
town, and he's the nameless animal attraction of "Mouse Hunt,"
DreamWorks SKG's clever first foray into family fare. Although it runs
out of steam towards its end, this live-action comedy still boasts
enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best Disney's
entire 1997 non-animated, kiddie-oriented catalog ... but consider
that list includes dismal tripe like "Air Bud," "Flubber" and "That
Darn Cat," and it's really not such a difficult feat to pull
off. Still, throw the two rodents in a boxing arena, and I'll be
hoping that the mouse from "Mouse Hunt" knocks some sense back into
Mickey.</P>
<P>Nathan Lane (Robin Williams' significant other from "The Birdcage")
and Lee Evans (last seen as a nervous bellhop in "The Fifth Element")
play Ernie and Lars Smuntz, befuddled brothers who have just inherited
two unwanted assets from their late father (William Hickey, in his
last role) -- a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old
mansion. Although Lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former,
he and Ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it
was designed by a famed architect. But there's a lone obstacle in
their way -- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house, and
he's not about to give up his place of residence without a fight.</P>
<P>Movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually
exquisite. The effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice, one
animatronic mouse and one computer-generated mouse are pretty
seamless. The splendid production design seems to be straight out of
Tim Burton's mind; the Smuntz's architecturally-unsound mansion is
like something straight out of "The Nightmare Before Christmas," and
the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of
Vincent Price's warped contraptions from "Edward Scissorhands." "Mouse
Hunt" is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim --
but it's hardly ever mean-spirited.</P>
<P>The star of the show is neither the top-billed Lane nor the titular
mouse. It's lanky British comedian Evans, whose hysterical bodily
antics suggest a cleaned-up Jim Carrey without the obnoxious overkill
(note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease);
Evans' banter with the ever-affable Lane is funny stuff, too, and
holds its own against the movie's more flashy physical shtick. Vicki
Lewis (Beth from "NewsRadio") is solid in a supporting role as Lars'
money-grubbing wife. And in a nifty bit of novelty casting,
Christopher Walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who
takes his job a little too seriously, popping a dropping into his
mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a "calcium
deficiency." Blech.</P>
<P>A basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling
humans -- is given a rather engaging execution. Their sparring is
imaginatively realized (I don't think I'll ever forget the sight of
that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of
Gouda), and although you really never fully root for either side,
that's okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is
practically promised from the first frame they share. "Mouse Hunt" may
take a while to get going (the rather lengthy set-up could test the
patience of some of the younger children, although I rather liked it,
much in part to Lane and Evans), and the climactic sequence is allowed
to play out for a bit too long, but this appears to be one family
movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable,
not unlike the original "Home Alone."</P>
