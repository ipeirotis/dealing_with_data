<P>     Philosophy generally makes for godawful cinema. Steven Pressfield's
novel THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE seemed like a terribly unlikely candidate
for a film translation, because it wasn't really a novel. It was a primer
in Hindu spiritual thought (Bagger Vance, Baghavad ... get it?) combined
with a mash note to the game of golf, wrapped loosely around a period
narrative. There was no way Pressfield's book could be turned into an
engaging film. Then again, that's what people said about Norman Maclean's
A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT, and somehow director Robert Redford managed to
turn that book into a pretty solid film. But how would a text comprised
primarily of mystical lessons and play-by-play from the links be rendered
on screen?</P>
<P>     Redford's adaptation of THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE radically
re-imagines Pressfield's novel to make it a more palatable screen story. 
In so doing, he rips out its soul and leaves a fairly bland sports drama
in its place. The bulk of the film takes place in Savannah, Georgia in
1931, where a once-in-a-lifetime event is about to take place. 
Cash-strapped heiress Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron), desperate to
generate interest in her late father's golf resort while the Depression
rages, arranges for an exhibition match between the era's two golf giants: 
Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill). There's also
interest in adding a local boy to the field, and everyone knows that World
War I hero and former amateur champion Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) should
be the one. But Junuh, psychologically scarred by the war, has no interest
in playing  until a mysterious fellow named Bagger Vance (Will Smith) 
shows up and offers to be Junuh's caddy.</P>
<P>     It's easy to see the logic behind most of screenwriter Jeremy Leven's
decisions in adapting BAGGER VANCE. He creates a romantic sub-plot by
casting Adele and Junuh as former lovers separated by circumstance; he
excises most of Baggers' lengthy speeches; he even tries to build up the
character of the young boy (J. Michael Moncrief) who will become the
story's flashback narrator (an uncredited Jack Lemmon) by exploring his
family's losses due to the Depression. The story is streamlined into a
tale of redemption and lost love regained, and the climax is rendered as a
nigh-mythical clash of titans. It's all quite clean and efficient, with
all the prosaic descriptions of transcendentally significant dogleg lefts
and most of the revelatory visions left on the page.</P>
<P>     In fact, it's so clean and efficient that it hardly registers as a
drama at all. While Pressfield's novel wasn't terribly concerned with
making his characters genuinely complex, it didn't really matter
contextually. Leven and Redford don't add much to that complexity, and
here it matters a lot. Redford is too concerned with making the atmosphere
mystical to give Junuh's pain an earthly urgency, and Matt Damon's
performance suffers as a result. Charlize Theron gets to weep a bit, but
Adele has "romantic interest" written all over her from the outset. Will
Smith does fine, relaxed work as Bagger, but his importance as a spiritual
teacher is diminished with his teachings reduced to fortune cookie-sized
aphorisms. BAGGER VANCE was not going to work on the screen with twenty
minute sermons on the Authentic Swing; it makes perfect sense to shift the
focus to the characters. It makes no sense to shift the focus, then still
leave the characters underdeveloped. </P>
<P>     As usual, Redford directs a technically accomplished piece of work,
beautifully photographed by Michael Ballhaus and smoothly edited. There's
simply no weight to any of it, despite the intrusively heavy score by
Rachel Portman. Instead of a meditation on a personal journey to
enlightenment told through the unique nature of the game of golf, the film
becomes a period piece with a few appealing performances. What remains is
a film about whether or not Junuh will win the big golf match and/or win
the girl. And while it's competently rendered, it's not exactly the matter
of cosmic import the film builds it up to be. You can't blame a filmmaker
for radically altering a text as inherently uncinematic as THE LEGEND OF
BAGGER VANCE. Redford, however, alters it to the point that you wonder why
he bothered to make it at all. He understood that philosophy generally
makes for godawful cinema. He didn't understand that without the
philosophy, or rich characterizations to replace it, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER
VANCE just barely breaks par.</P>
