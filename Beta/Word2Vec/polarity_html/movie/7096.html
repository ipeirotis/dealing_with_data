<PRE>"And to all the critics who hated our last flick -- all is forgiven."
               -- CHASING AMY's closing credits</PRE>
<P>     Well, I didn't exactly hate MALLRATS, but I thought it was a 
comedown for Kevin Smith, the talented writer/director who debuted 
strongly with 1994's CLERKS.  CHASING AMY is the third film in Smith's 
so-called "New Jersey Trilogy" (a series that may end up having more 
than three entries), so named because most of the action takes place in 
the Garden State.  Like CLERKS, but unlike MALLRATS, principal 
photography took place in Smith's home town, as well as across the river 
in Manhattan.</P>
<P>     CHASING AMY fits in nicely with the director's previous two films.  
As in CLERKS and MALLRATS, there are numerous references to pop culture 
(the ubiquitous STAR WARS films, comic books, the Archie comic strip, TV 
shows ALICE and STAR TREK, and even a few in-jokes related to CLERKS).  
Smith's brand of bawdy humor is also very much in evidence, although it 
should be noted that CHASING AMY isn't as hilarious as CLERKS.  In fact, 
it could be argued that this film isn't even as funny as MALLRATS.  
Instead, CHASING AMY finds other ways to satisfy its audience, and the 
result is the most complete and mature film of Smith's short career.</P>
<P>     With CHASING AMY, it's easy to anticipate a certain degree of 
inventive humor, but what's a bit unexpected is the solid drama, 
effective romance, and strong characters.  CLERKS worked because the 
dialogue sparkled, but Smith has honed his screenwriting and film making 
skills since then.  While CHASING AMY boasts the same keen interplay, 
that quality, along with first-rate character development, acts as a 
supplement to the smart, surprisingly original plot.  The movie starts 
out as light as a feather, but it doesn't take long for us to realize 
that CHASING AMY isn't just another lark for Smith.  This movie is about 
something, and the deeper we get into it, the more we realize how 
emotionally on-target the script is.</P>
<P>     Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) and Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) are comic 
book authors.  Their BLUNTMAN & CHRONIC magazine is a big-seller, and, 
when they attend a comic book convention in New York, they attract long 
lines for autograph signings.  At that convention, Holden meets fellow 
comic writer/artist Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams).  Alyssa's project 
is the less testosterone-oriented IDIOSYNCRATIC ROUTINE.  She and Holden 
hit it off almost immediately.  They go out for a few drinks and play 
darts.  Later, when talking to best friend Banky, he claims that he and 
Alyssa "shared a moment" and confesses that he has fallen for her.  But, 
whether or not it's really love, Holden is in for a big surprise because 
Alyssa is a lesbian.  So, while she wants to be friends and pal around 
with him, Holden finds himself helplessly, hopelessly smitten.</P>
<P>     Smith clearly has his hand on the pulse of his generation ("X" 
marks the spot).  His observations about comic books, video games, and 
other aspects of life in the '90s are as insightful as they often are 
scathing.  But this is nothing new -- it was evident in both CLERKS and 
MALLRATS.  What's different here is that Smith has crafted a touching, 
nuanced romance which may be the most memorable screen love affair since 
BEFORE SUNRISE.  There are real human feelings and problems involved in 
Holden and Alyssa's relationship, and, every time the storyline 
threatens to devolve into a cliche, it somehow avoids the trap.  There's 
also a rich subtext pertaining to the difficulty that many individuals 
face in attaining a level of comfort with their sexual identity.</P>
<P>     The best scenes are those that explore the evolving relationship 
between Holden and Alyssa.  There's a wonderful montage that depicts 
them doing all the kinds of things that friends do.  Ben Affleck and 
Joey Lauren Adams, both veterans of Smith films, develop an effective 
chemistry.  Adams, who looks a little like Cameron Diaz and sounds a 
little like Jennifer Tilley, displays surprising dramatic range and 
ability.  She's someone to watch.</P>
<P>     Affleck and Adams aren't the only familiar faces to appear in 
CHASING AMY.  Jason Lee, who played one of the leads in MALLRATS, is 
back, albeit in a different role.  Brian O'Halloran, CLERKS' Dante, has 
a cameo as a TV producer who wants to develop BLUNTMAN & CHRONIC into a 
Saturday morning show.  And, of course, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob 
(Smith) are on hand, dispensing advice as only they can.  The end 
credits once again promise their return (in the long-awaited, often-
delayed DOGMA, which was originally supposed to be the follow-up to 
CLERKS).  </P>
<P>     Ever wondered exactly what lesbians do when they're together?  Or 
how they define "virginity"?  Banky does, and he's not shy about asking.  
This leads to a graphically funny sequence that results in Alyssa and 
Banky comparing "war wounds" gathered from past sexual encounters.  Like 
CLERKS, CHASING AMY doesn't shy away from profane conversations.  
There's even an instance when oral sex is compared to (of all things) 
THE WEATHER CHANNEL and CNN (you'll have to see the movie to understand 
why).  In fact, I can't print any of CHASING AMY's best lines here -- 
they're all R-rated.</P>
<P>     CHASING AMY is entertainment of the best sort.  For nearly two 
hours, it keeps the audience enraptured.  There aren't many missteps, 
and, those few that exist are minor and easily forgiven.  CHASING AMY is 
touching, funny, sweet, and most important of all, real -- a welcome 
breath of fresh air.  You can't ask for more than that from any motion 
picture, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a movie in theaters these 
days that offers anything more appealing, revealing, or enjoyable than 
Kevin Smith's third feature.</P>
