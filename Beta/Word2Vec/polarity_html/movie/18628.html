<P>Eddie Murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career. Known
for his notorious late 80's slump, Murphy has still managed to bounce
back with a handful of hits in the past few years. With the exception of
the dreadful Holy Man, he appears to be on pace for a full-fledged
comeback.</P>
<P>Life was a great move on the part of Murphy and co-star Martin Lawrence,
because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to
slap-sticky drivel. Director Ted Demme is smart enough to realize that
the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own, and
doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up. Life is, in a sense,
one great balancing act with Murphy on one end and Lawrence on the
other. Amazingly, the scale never tips in either's favor due to the
marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the
other.</P>
<P>As the movie opens, we're introduced to Ray Gibson (Eddie Murphy), a
two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club. There he meets
a successful businessman named Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence). Somehow,
after multiple contrivances, the mismatched pair find themselves on
their way to Mississippi on a moonshine run. When all is said and done,
Ray and Claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed
by the town sheriff.</P>
<P>Hence the setting of Life: Mississippi State Prison, where the main
characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important, and
become set on finding an fool-proof escape plan. The film takes us from
the 30's all the way to the 90's, presenting a difficult task in showing
how the aging process affects Ray and Claude. Luckily, Rick Baker
handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic, Academy
Award caliber manner. Not only do we believe the characters look as if
they're 90 years old, but they sound like it, too. Murphy and Lawrence
are completely convincing in the lead roles, even as crotchety old cons
bickering over a game of cards. This is just one of the pleasant
surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve.</P>
<P>While the ads are marketing Life as a straight arrow comedy, there is a
hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core. But the comedic
aspects work wonderfully, wisely drawing strength from the talents of
the two stars. The movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama, but in
both senses, it's an overwhelming delight.</P>
<P>I could say a few bad things about the movie, but I don't want to. It's
such a nice surprise, such a great vehicle for Eddie Murphy and Martin
Lawrence, that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll.</P>
