<P>     APT PUPIL'S Todd Bowden (Brad Renfro) is practically the poster child
for an upstanding American teenager circa 1984.  He's a straight-A student
on track to graduate from high school at sixteen; he's a star baseball
pitcher; his parents (Bruce Davison and Ann Dowd) are successful, involved
and, astonishingly, still happily married.  It is this same Todd Bowden
who discovers that a man in his Northern California town named Arthur
Denker (Ian McKellen) is actually fugitive Nazi war criminal Kurt
Dussander.  It is this same Todd Bowden who blackmails Denker, threatening
to expose him unless he describes war-time attrocities to Todd in
unrelenting detail.  It is this same Todd Bowden who becomes obsessed with
the horrifying images of concentration camps, and who turns to strange
acts of cruelty.</P>
<P>     Creepy, disquieting stuff, to be sure, but there's one crucial puzzle
piece missing from director Bryan Singer's (THE USUAL SUSPECTS) adaptation
of the Stephen King novella:  why?  Why does Todd become so improbably
fascinated with the horrors of genocide and the wielding of absolute power
over the life of another?  Why do Denker's tales turn him alternately into
a nightmare-plagued wreck and a glassy-eyed borderline psycho?  There's
certainly a story to be told by making the teen demon of APT PUPIL a
golden boy rather than a troubled misfit -- perhaps to suggest the
capacity for evil within us all, perhaps as a commentary on how we make
the forbidden fascinating by hiding it from the eyes of children.  What's
missing is a motivation for this particular boy, something that makes him
more than a symbolic representation of good youth gone awry.</P>
<P>     That absence of motivation becomes even more glaring in the film's
second half, when the power dynamic between the two characters shifts back
in Denker's favor.  His life of quiet isolation shattered by re-living his
past, Denker begins to show that the rush he got from manipulating lives
was merely in hibernation.  McKellen's sharp performance shows Denker's 
icy confidence growing by the scene, until it's clear that the hunted has
become the hunter once more.  At that same time, Todd is trying to recover
from letting his grades slide through his frequent visits with Denker,
seemingly returning to "normal" until Denker forces him into an
acknowledgement of how far he's truly willing to go.  It's easy to
understand Denker's character and follow his twists, turns and changes.
By contrast, Todd's dark side seems to emerge strictly for bad seed shock
value.</P>
<P>      Even the gaps in Todd's characterization become less important as
Singer's taut direction takes over in the climactic thirty minutes.  As
circumstances threaten to expose the actions of both Todd and Denker, the
simmering tension begins building at an impressive clip.  APT PUPIL is a
rare example of a thriller that gets better as it approaches its
conclusion, rather than collapsing in a muddle of rushed plot points and
pat resolutions.  It's hard not to imagine how effective a film it might
have been if Todd Bowden made more sense as a character.  The token
glimpses of his friendships, romantic life and hobbies are maddening in
their mundanity.  Something significant happens in the space between Todd
spotting Denker on a bus and their initial contact, something reduced in
the film to a "One Month Later" title card.  That missing something is
what makes APT PUPIL merely morbidly intriguing, rather than truly
disturbing.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 diluted pupils:  6.</PRE>
