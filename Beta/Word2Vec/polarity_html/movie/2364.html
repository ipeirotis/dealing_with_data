<PRE>                                INTERSECTION
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Richard Gere, Sharon Stone, Lolita Davidovich.
Screenplay:  David Rayfiel & Marshall Brickman.
Director:  Mark Rydell.</P>
<P>     Exactly when it happened, I can't put my finger on.  For about
half an hour of INTERSECTION, I was intrigued, and wondered whether I
was on to my first guilty pleasure of 1994.  Then, at some point, I
began to realize that INTERSECTION was taking itself far too
seriously.  While the film is cleverly structured and reasonably
well-acted, it began to irritate me that it was trying to turn a
mid-life crisis into a great existential drama.  Worse yet, it
presented me with a "hero" I couldn't stand and an ending that left me
angry.</P>
<P>     As INTERSECTION opens, Vancouver architect Vincent Eastman
(Richard Gere) is spinning his Mercedes into an oncoming truck.  The
rest of the film takes us back to the events leading up to that crash,
as well as its immediate aftermath.  We learn that Vincent is separated
from his wife and business partner Sally (Sharon Stone), and living
with journalist Olivia Marshak (Lolita Davidovich).  Vincent and Olivia
are planning to be married and to move into a house Vincent is
designing, but Vincent still finds himself jealous of Sally's new
relationship.  Throughout are additional flashbacks to the early years
of Vincent and Sally's marriage, and his first meetings with Olivia.
Vincent finds himself torn between the two women, and his decision will
place him on the road to that fateful encounter with a big rig.</P>
<P>     As I noted, INTERSECTION's early scenes boast enough slickness and
craft to lend the illusion of consequence.  The lead performances by
Gere, Stone and Davidovich are all understated, and Davidovich in
particular generates quite a bit of audience sympathy.  Efficient
editing by Mark Warner and glossy photography by the talented Vilmos
Zsigmond create a dreamy atmosphere, and James Newton Howard's jazzy
score plays up the romance angle.  The dialogue in the script by David
Rayfiel and Marshall Brickman is snappy, keeping conversations lively
enough to maintain interest.</P>
<P>     It isn't all that long, however, before it becomes evident that
there isn't all that much going on beneath INTERSECTION's shiny
surface.  The performers are "understated" primarily because there is
so little substance to any of the characters.  Olivia is perky and
sweet, but it's never particularly clear why she's so into Vincent.
Sally, in the flashback sequences, is made to appear icy and reserved,
and one of those scenes is quite clever.  Still, nothing in her
character seems to justify Vincent's behavior, and this may be
INTERSECTION's critical failing.  Vincent never becomes a man facing a
real problem; he's just a jerk playing both ends against the middle.
It was impossible for me to work up any sympathy for a man who leaves
his wife without ever discussing his problems with his marriage, then
fires snide and jealous questions at her about a new boyfriend.  To
make matters even worse, the resolution is a complete cop-out, allowing
Vincent somehow to make both women happy inadvertently.  If it seems
like I was expecting a morality tale...well, by the time it was over, I
was.</P>
<P>     But even those who allow Vincent more leeway than I did are likely
to be turned off by Mark Rydell's heavy handed direction.  Gere's angst
ridden face is frequently in close-up, usually while driving; he
probably ends up playing as many scenes with a steering wheel as he
does with another actor.  An antique clock becomes a distracting
SYMBOL, and the omnipresent Northwest rain an objective correlative I
could have done without.  Frequent flashbacks and dream sequences make
for a dizzying narrative.  So many stylistic choices in INTERSECTION
turned me off that I'm tempted not to mention the off-handed allusion
to the fact that Vincent's 13-year-old daughter has an eating
disorder.</P>
<PRE>     Eh, why nitpick?  Name it and it probably turned me off.</PRE>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 mid-life crises:  3.</PRE>
