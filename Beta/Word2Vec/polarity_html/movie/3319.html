<P>     A couple of cliches come to mind while watching Danny Boyle's
deliciously diabolical feature debut, SHALLOW GRAVE.  The first--that
money is the root of all evil--is obvious.  The other--that it's
always the quiet ones who bear the closest watching--is only marginally
more obscure.</P>
<P>     The comparisons are already out.  Check the newspaper blurbs and
you'll see that Boyle is being touted as the "new Hitchcock" or the
successor to the Coen Brothers.  There's even a reference or two to
Quentin Tarantino and PULP FICTION.  And, to one degree or another, these
are all valid comments.  SHALLOW GRAVE has a quick-paced, Hitchcockian
sense of suspense, the Coen Brothers' noir atmosphere, and a PULP
FICTION-like ability to make us laugh in the most gruesome of
circumstances.  However, more than anything else, SHALLOW GRAVE recalls a
couple of recent John Dahl films (THE LAST SEDUCTION and RED ROCK WEST)
in overall feel, if not in specific content.  Boyle has the same twisted
fun with his characters.</P>
<P>     The film starts off a little slowly with some necessary exposition
to get the story jump-started.  Three flatmates--Juliette (Kerry Fox),
a doctor; David (Christopher Eccleston), an accountant; and Alex (Ewan
McGregor), a journalist--are looking for someone to move into the
vacant fourth bedroom of their suite.  After interviewing an interesting
range of applicants, they settle on Hugo (Keith Allen), whose outlook on
life seems a good match for their own.  And his willingness to pay up
front with cold cash doesn't hurt.</P>
<P>     However, Hugo's time with the trio is destined to be short.  One
day, he moves in; the next, he's dead, apparently of a drug overdose.
Left behind in his room are his corpse, evidence of his addiction, and a
suitcase full of money.  This presents a dilemma for the flatmates:  call
the cops or dump the body and keep the cash.  Because of the nature of
the film, it's not hard to guess which they choose.  So, while two thugs
searching for Hugo begin leaving a trail of dead bodies, Juliette, David,
and Alex take Hugo's remains out to the woods where they mutilate the
corpse beyond recognition and bury it in a shallow grave.</P>
<P>     There aren't any real, three-dimensional characters in SHALLOW
GRAVE, but the stock types are played with such ability by Fox (the aloof
female), Eccleston (the reclusive nerd), and McGregor (the wisecracking
party boy), that it doesn't matter.  Director Danny Boyle, a veteran of
British TV (his work on INSPECTOR MORSE has been seen on this side of the
Atlantic), imbues SHALLOW GRAVE with a style that at times seems a little
too slick.</P>
<P>     In fact, a weakness of this film is that it occasionally tries to be
too clever (bordering on smug).  Several of the apparently "shocking"
plot twists aren't all that surprising, but Boyle treats each new turn of
John Hodge's script as if it was the most unexpected possibility.  This
objection is in the nature of a minor quibble, however, since it does
little to detract from the viewer's overall satisfaction.  Taken as a
whole, SHALLOW GRAVE is a reasonably enjoyable (for those captivated by
this sort of thing) black comedy/noir thriller that justifies at least a
portion of the praise being heaped upon it from overseas.</P>
