<PRE>                        FAIRY TALE: A TRUE STORY
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     Right before the ending credits roll, the fairies gather for a
massive panoply of color.  Why the screenwriter wasted most of the rest
of the movie treading water remains FAIRY TALE: A TRUE STORY's biggest
mystery.  Although the picture has an undeniable underlying charm, it
may have you squirming in your seat as it did my son, waiting for
something, anything, to happen while the fairies are waiting in the
wings.</P>
<P>     Based on an incident that happened in England around the time of
the first World War, the movie tells the story of two girls, Elsie
Wright (Florence Hoath) and Frances Griffiths (Elizabeth Earl), who
claimed to have seen fairies in their garden.  As proof, they borrow a
camera and take pictures.  Since only the girls have seen the fairies,
the adults must rely on the photos as proof.  When a disbelieving Harry
Houdini (Harvey Keitel) and his believing friend Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
(Peter O'Toole) send the photos to Kodak to look for fraud, Kodak
pronounces the photos probably genuine.  The show uses this and other
carefully chosen ambiguity to advance the storyline.</P>
<P>     Although all are perfectly acceptable, none of the actors stand
out.  The girls are cute and the adults perplexed, but their emotions
run no deeper.  Director Charles Sturridge has trouble staging
compelling scenes when the fairies are on a break, and they spend most
of the film sleeping in their trailer.  When they are allowed to come
out and play, they mesmerize the audience.  The trouble is that they
get no more than a few minutes of screen time.  And the dialog when
they are not on the set rarely captivates.</P>
<P>     Michael Howells's sets and Shirley Russell's costumes recreate the
era with a deft sense of the tragedy of war and of the working class
environment of the region.  And Michael Coulter's cinematography is
warm and inviting.</P>
<P>     The special effects of the fairies are dazzling.  Small people
with gossamer wings and radiant faces fly around as if in a
particularly lovely dream.  When they are on the screen, magic is in
the air.</P>
<P>     Peter O'Toole gives an earnest reading of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,
and Keitel delivers a quizzical one of Harry Houdini.  "Never try to
fool children," admonishes Houdini.  "They expect nothing and therefore
see everything."  Although he has some faith in children, he cannot
abide adult charlatans who try to deceive people with tricks that they
claim are supernatural.  "Anything can be faked by anyone," he asserts,
and he produces some fakes of his own to prove his point.</P>
<P>     Occasionally Ernie Contreras's script does provide some insights
as when the Elsie's father (Paul McGann) talks with their mother
(Phoebe Nicholls) about their dead son.  He confesses that he can no
longer remember his own son's face.  When he tries, the face blurs as
if in a crowd among other faces.</P>
<P>     Although the trailers have a high energy level, the film itself
frequently drags.  With its severely underdeveloped script, the movie
is a big disappointment.  The tragedy is that with more scenes like the
ending one, the film could have been so special.  With the paucity of
good kid's movies, it is a shame that one with so much potential
realized it in so few scenes.</P>
<P>     FAIRY TALE: A TRUE STORY runs a little long at 1:39.  It is rated
PG for the sight of a man horribly disfigured by war and for one word
of profanity.  The film would be fine for kids of all ages.  My son
Jeffrey, age 8, thought the movie was good but was upset that the
fairies were hardly in it at all.  I'm not voting against any film with
fairies this sweet no matter how uninvolving the rest of the story, so
it's thumbs up from me and ** 1/2.</P>
