<P>     Any remake of an Alfred Hitchcock film is at best an uncertain 
project, as A PERFECT MURDER illustrates.  Frankly, DIAL M FOR MURDER is 
not one of the master director's greatest efforts, so there is ample 
room for improvement.  Unfortunately, instead of updating the script, 
ironing out some of the faults, and speeding up the pace a little, A 
PERFECT MURDER has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything 
that was worthwhile about DIAL M FOR MURDER, leaving behind the nearly-
unwatchable wreckage of a would-be '90s thriller.  </P>
<P>     Almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities.  
The best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what's going on so 
that these flaws in logic don't become apparent until long after the 
final credits have rolled.  Unfortunately, in A PERFECT MURDER, the 
faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they're 
happening.  This is a very bad sign.  Not only do such occurrences 
shatter any suspension of disbelief, but they have the astute viewer 
looking for the next such blunder.  Of course, in the case of A PERFECT 
MURDER, at least that gives an audience member something to do besides 
concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless, cardboard characters.</P>
<P>     A PERFECT MURDER isn't a strict remake of DIAL M FOR MURDER, but it 
does borrow heavily from Frederick Knott's play (which was also the 
source material for Hitchcock's version, as well as a 1981 made-for-TV 
retelling).  Emily Hayes (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the wealthy wife of 
powerful Wall Street mover-and-shaker Steven Hayes (Michael Douglas).  
Their marriage isn't going well -- Emily resents Steven's controlling 
instincts, and, as a form of rebellion, she is having an affair with a 
penniless painter, David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen).  When Steven learns of 
the relationship, he decides to confront David, but his approach isn't 
that of a typical cuckolded husband.  Instead of yelling or threatening, 
Steven offers David a proposal that's too good to resist:  for $500,000 
in cash ($100,000 before, the rest after), he is to break into Steven's 
New York apartment and kill Emily. (Of course, after getting the first 
payment, David never bothers to ask how he's supposed to get the rest.)</P>
<P>     Ultimately, I'm not sure which of the three main characters we're 
supposed to be sympathetic to:  the cold-hearted husband, who wants his 
wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune; her mercenary lover, 
who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million; or the woman, who is 
happily carrying on an extramarital affair.  Not only are these 
individuals all profoundly dislikable, but they're not interesting.  
(It's possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see 
RESERVOIR DOGS -- but there has to be something compelling about them, 
which, in this case, there isn't.)  Steven, Emily, and David are all 
lifted directly from the Screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes.</P>
<P>     The actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their 
paychecks.  Michael Douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that 
he can do in his sleep -- he's Gordon Gekko with an unfaithful wife.  
Gwyneth Paltrow, who was recently delightful and appealing in SLIDING 
DOORS, is simply awful here.  She now has the dubious distinction of 
have starred in two of 1998's worst thrillers (the other being HUSH).  
At least Viggo Mortensen (G.I. JANE) has a little fun with his part, but 
then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies.  The thin 
supporting cast includes David Suchet, the star of "Poirot," as a police 
inspector, and Sarita Choudhury (KAMA SUTRA) as Emily's best friend.</P>
<P>     A PERFECT MURDER is a plodding production that generates almost no 
suspense from beginning to end.  There aren't many twists and turns in 
the unexpectedly linear script, which makes the ending inevitable almost 
from the start.  It's surprising to see director Andrew Davis, the man 
behind THE FUGITIVE, involved in this mess, but, like his stars, he too 
needs to earn a living.  It's just that remaking Hitchcock, and doing it 
so badly, hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the 
dough.</P>
