<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Carol Reed's breakthrough film as a director after a long and
undistinguished film career. He followed this success with two other
classics in British cinema -- "The Fallen Idol" and, his greatest film,
"The Third Man." The subject matter of the "Odd Man Out" is about a
political fugitive on the run who has just robbed a mill in Belfast and
murdered the cashier, which ironically happens after he comes to believe
violence may not be the best solution for change...though he still
believes fervently in supporting the IRA cause financially. James Mason
plays Johnny McQueen, the chief of an Irish organization, though not
mentioned by name, but obviously is the IRA. He has just committed the
robbery after escaping from prison while serving a long sentence for
gun-running. He was cooped up for the last 6 months in Kathleen's (Ryan)
family house, where she lives with her colorful granny. She is madly in
love with him and wants him to chose her instead of the organization.</P>
<PRE>Warning: spoilers to follow.</PRE>
<P>The robbery is botched when Johnny blacks out and can't get into the
getaway car in time. A cashier with a gun pointed at him tries to stop
him, but gets fatally shot as they wrestle to the ground. Johnny is
severly wounded in the shoulder and when the cowardly driver Pat
(Cusack) refuses to stop and the others can't help him into the car
letting him drop to the gutter, he therefore must go through an alley to
escape the police and winds up lying in a delirious state in an air raid
shelter.</P>
<P>His close comrade Dennis (Beatty) goes searching for him, hoping to get
him out of the area, which the police have sealed off. Meanwhile two
others in the robbery, Pat and Murphy (Irving), get drunk in the house
of an informer (Delaney) and tell her everything, betraying their
comrades. She turns them over to the inspector (O'Day), whose men shoots
them as they try to escape from her house, and she also tells the
inspector about Kathleen and Dennis, making a deal with him to look the
other way at her black market schemes.</P>
<P>Wandering the streets in a delirious state and weakened by a loss of
blood, Johnny is taken in by two helpful women pedestrians who patch him
up and turn him loose when they discover who he is, not interested in
the reward or in helping him escape, or in turning him over to the
police...they are just trying to figure out what to do that is right.
Placed in a cab by a reveler out in the drenching rain, the cabby drops
him off at a junkyard where he is spotted by a caged bird fancier, Shell
(McCormick). He figures he can sell him to Father Tom (Fay) and thereby
make some cash to help him out in his destitute state. Kathleen has also
gone to Father Tom for help and he tells her he will try to save
Johnny's soul and get him to surrender if he is brought to him...that
there is nothing else that he can do for him. But, her plans are to
smuggle him out of the country by boat and go with him far away from the
problems here, and try to start a new life.</P>
<P>One of Shell's acquaintances is a drunken, homosexual artist, Lukey
(Newton), who is a struggling painter using Shell as a model for a
saint. When he hears about Johnny from him, he insists that he bring
Johnny to him, as he wants to look into the desperate eyes of a fugitive
on the run and capture his idealistic soul on canvas. Shell's other pal
he lives with is Tober (Brook-Jones), someone who could have been a
doctor if he didn't screw up. He wants to mend Johnny so that he can
prove his medical skills on the wounded man. He does not care that he
would only be healing Johnny so that the fugitive could be executed.
Both wish only to use Johnny to prove that they can function with skill
in their fields, where they are currently viewed as failures. They have
no human interest in him, which even Johnny in his dying state can see,
as he stumbles away from them and in a religiously charged scene, he
quotes from  I Corinthians 8 -- which is the verse that says man is
nothing without charity. That only help given without expecting
something from it, is truly a Christian charity.</P>
<P>The perverted Shell tries to bring the still weakened Johnny to Father
Tom and thereby to freedom -- his price for doing that good deed is a
promise of approval from Father Tom and perhaps some money and
acceptance for the doleful life he leads. But Johnny collapses before he
reaches the church and when Kathleen spots him in the square she tries
to steer him to the waterfront, but it is too late, as the police had
her tailed. She commits suicide, taking Johnny with her, dying for what
she believes is greater than faith or anything else in life, her love of
Johnny. In fact, the only glimmer of hope that is offerred to the people
of Northern Ireland, is that the doomed Johnny died in the arms of
someone who was real and loved him, rather than at the hands of the
police, or with the IRA, or with the priest, or someone who was selling
him for dispensation. The hope is that the Republic will be a true one,
based on the peace and love of all the people of Ireland, once it
recognizes that it is the people themselves who have to unite as one and
not be fooled by groups that are only giving them a false ideal.</P>
<P>Londoner Reed has shot a pro-British film, that is stronger on being a
suspenseful art film than an accurately political one. The dark rainy
streets of Belfast and the brooding mood of Mason, made this film look
much like a noir feature. Mason seems like he is in the middle of a
nightmare, traveling through an ugly urban landscape where there is no
escape. It is preachy in spots, trying to show many different sides to
the struggle, where characters along the way seem more like symbols than
real flesh-and-blood. There are bar patrons spouting the cause while
drenched in ale, rational British policemen acting with restraint,
ordinary citizens not wanting to get involved in the violence or looking
to turn the fugitive in for the reward money, and there are decent IRA
family members all caught up in the turbulent times, each trying to
figure a way out of the mess the country is in. But the film was very
weak in setting up the political arguments that caused the civil war in
the first place, as no rational person will disagree with the film's
anti-violent stance. But there is a lot going on that the film left
uncovered from the point of view of what the revolutionaries are
protesting. I found the film, nevertheless, absorbing, especially as a
thriller--a 'cops and robbers' tale.</P>
