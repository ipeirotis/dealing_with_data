<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A satirical film where Warren Beatty tries to talk the black man's rap
to get across his political message: which is that there's something
wrong in politics that corrupts everyone in it. He plays a
self-destructing liberal Democratic California senator, Bulworth (
pretty close to bullshit), who is running for re-election in 1996 and is
suffering from despondency after several sleepless nights. He is unhappy
with the phony he has become, so his solution is to hire an unknown hit
man to kill him. He also takes out a $10 million dollar life insurance
policy for his teenage daughter's benefit with an insurance
representative who is influencing his vote on some impending insurance
legislation.</P>
<P>But something happens to him along the way to a South Central L.A. black
church, where he decides to tell the truth. Maybe he does this because
he feels relieved that he's going to die soon. Anyway, he starts
chastising the congregation for following the guilty O.J. Simpson and
not fighting for the real needs of the community, such as the failure of
inner-city schools and developing local businesses and filling the need
for black leaders to replace those who got killed in the '60s and '70s;
and, he blames himself and all politicians for taking the easy money the
corporations give to make sure their side is always taken care of.
Tossing aside a prepared speech about the country that starts off
saying, "We stand on the doorstep of a new millennium... ." Instead, he
tells the black congregation that the government doesn't care about them
because they don't contribute enough money to re-election campaigns.
Beatty believes that is the problem with the country, the great divide
between the haves-and-the have-nots must be resolved, and that the
politicians will always support those who contribute to them and ignore
those who have no power unless there is some kind of election reform.</P>
<P>He encounters a sexy black woman in the church, Nina (Halle ), who
re-invigorates him, reminding him how he once thought of himself as a
liberal Democrat who cared about the truth, but who has now lost the way
and seems no different than the Republicans. She takes him to a hip-hop
club and he sheds his whiteness in favor of the black man's rap, which
he will ridiculously imitate for the remainder of the campaign, to the
initial fright of his campaign staff led by Oliver Platt, in the role of
a stereotypical flunky, no new acting ground is broken here, as the main
comedy of the film comes about as the sleazy Pratt adopts to any view
that keeps him in power. The other key staff member is his veteran
campaign advisor, Jack Warden, who plays his minor role low-key, trying
to go with his successful meal ticket as far it could take him.</P>
<P>Invited to speak before a largely Jewish crowd of supporters in the
entertainment field, he tells them they make crappy films and are only
interested in making money. At a business luncheon he insults the big
contributors to his campaign, such as, Paul Sorvino, who is head of an
insurance corporation that gives him campaign money and money under the
table to block an insurance bill that would help the indigent.</P>
<P>Falling for Nina, meeting her family in their house, he leaves the house
and goes strolling in the hood and ends up trying to be a combo of Jerry
Lewis and James Cagney in one body, helping some drug dealing boys in
the street from getting beat on by a racist cop. This is an awkardly
embarrassing scene, that was more embarrassing than funny to watch
Beatty try to ingratiate himself this way to his black brothers. It
reminded me in an analogous way of the liberals in the '60s who invited
the Black Panthers into their wealthy homes and thought they were so
chic.</P>
<P>Bulworth also decides he is beginning to have some fun, or maybe its the
weed and coke that got to him, as he tries to get a hold of the hit man
and call off the job. The most unbelievable scene in the film-a scene
that was just too gooey to take without asking what Beatty was thinking
of-was the conversion of the local drug dealer (Cheadle) to the cause of
the community after hearing one of Beatty's speeches on TV. Even Frank
Capra wasn't that schmaltzy.</P>
<P>Meanwhile CNN is interviewing him and C-Span is following him around in
a truck, not understanding where he is going with this new image change.
The story gets too ridiculous at this point to even be satirical or
credible, it is just bad filmmaking; but it does try in its unclear and
scrambled way to blame the media and the rich people who control it, for
not being risk takers and offering fresh arguments into the political
fray. In his contemptuous style (which hides a self-righteous anger), he
sounds more preachy than a Sidney Lumet does in Network, as he seems to
have retained an old liberal paternalistic style towards blacks from
back in the days of the '60s and '70s, that he can't shake.</P>
<P>Amiri Baraka (poet & playwright), supposedly a voice of consciousness,
plays a homeless wiseman who keeps popping up from scene-to-scene,
uttering this heavy stream of consciousness rap, "We need no more
ghosts, we need a spirit."</P>
<P>The fault of the film, is that Beatty can't gracefully pull off what he
is trying to accomplish without appearing to be smug about it, like he's
the white man who knows best what to do, and that anything he does is
super cool because he really cares about the blacks and the poor (sic).
His naive solution for race problems is to have the races fornicate
together and have a mixed racial country.</P>
<P>Everyone in the film is a cardboard prop for Beatty to lay it into them
with his political cliches.</P>
<P>Just when I thought Wag the Dog was the stupidest political comedy I
ever saw, along comes this sophomoric venture, showing no plausible way
of replacing the old lies of Senator Bulworth with his new so-called
truths, and as a result it is a film that out wags the dog's tail in
silliness and prattle, unable to have the demented Bulworth say what he
would do when elected, except what is implied, that the people will
trust him because he's so hip and daring, and he's just so with it.
There was a smugness about this film that made its childish political
voice seem more annoying than it should be, even taking away any
enjoyment that might have been derived from its comic efforts. This is
just a bad film that tried to say something about social injustice, the
class differences between the rich and the poor, the unfair loss of
welfare programs, the inhibiting cost of health insurance that is
falsely being blamed on the government when it is the fault of insurance
companies why the rates are so high, the hypocrisies of the Gulf War,
and the failure of the media to be more responsive in covering all the
political corruption. Beatty is just not the filmmaker I would want
telling my side of the story. He has a way of glossing over his once
real candidate's foibles, Bobby Kennedy and Gary Hart, while pretending
to have answers that he doesn't have or at least, doesn't present them
that well in the film. All he has done is make a film that is cliched
and overbearing and funny in a not funny way, and he sounds no different
or trustworthy than the politicians he features in the film, Clinton and
Dole. And, I don't mean that as a compliment.</P>
