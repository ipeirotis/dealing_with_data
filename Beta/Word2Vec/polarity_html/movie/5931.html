<P>     The advertising campaign for THE CROW: CITY OF ANGELS invites us to
"Believe in the power of another," but it sounds more like a plea for
sympathy.  After all, what are you supposed to do when you want to make a
sequel but the star of the first film is no longer with us?  Well, I
suppose the obvious answer -- swallow your checkbook and allow THE CROW to
rest in peace -- was unacceptable, but this is one sequel which seemed
utterly doomed from the first minute.  1994's THE CROW was a film with a
striking look, but it owed virtually every ounce of emotional resonance it
had to the tragic death of star Brandon Lee while filming the scene in
which his character is killed.  CITY OF ANGELS has no such back story to
prop up its re-tread of the first film, and seems determined to substitute
excess for emotion in what has to rank as one of the year's most grueling
cinematic ordeals.</P>
<P>     The setting is the near future in the City of Angels, where a drug
lord named Judah Earl (Richard Brooks) controls all.  It is the misfortune
of a mechanic named Ash (Vincent Perez) and his young son to witness a
gang of Judah's thugs murdering someone, and they in turn are murdered as
well.  But a little thing like death can't keep Ash down, not when he
becomes one with the vengeance-minded spirit of The Crow.  He befriends a
tattoo artist named Sarah (Mia Kirshner), but he has little time to spend
on relationships.  His mission is to find the people responsible for his
son's death -- including Judah himself -- and destroy them so that his
soul might find peace.</P>
<P>     If there is anyone you should really feel sorry for in this mess, it
is Vincent Perez, because I don't think he ever had a chance.  This isn't
like Val Kilmer stepping into Batman's boots, or Pierce Brosnan taking
over as 007; it's more like someone trying to replace Patrick Stewart as
Captain Picard.  THE CROW's fans are passionate about the film, and in
particular about the man they see as headed towards stardom before he was
cut down in his prime.  Perez has the right look for the part -- he looks
serviceably eerie in The Crow's face paint and leather duster -- but he's
not Brandon Lee.  That's not even a criticism, because I'm not convinced
Lee was anything that special.  The point is that those who come to this
film because they loved THE CROW are going to have a real problem with
this guy with a French accent taking over for their hero.</P>
<P>     Then again, I suppose Perez always could have said no, especially
once he got a look at a script which has him making his entrance emerging
from a fountain of water in tattered clothes looking like Esther Williams
on the way to a rave.  There is plenty of silliness like that in CITY OF
ANGELS (it tries to stake a claim to mytho-poetic status by including a
Tiresias-like blind seer), but mostly it is an empty recycling of THE
CROW.  The radical switch involves having the dead man avenging a son
rather than a lover, but otherwise it simply finds a different
leather-clad fellow killing his own killers one by one, and oh, the time
and energy exerted on finding creative methods of inflicting pain.  The
bill of fare in CITY OF ANGELS includes a hypodermic needle jammed up a
nose, a tattoo needle applied to the eyeball, eyes gouged out, and even a
tortured crow (don't worry, no animals were harmed in the making of this
film).  It's a resolutely ugly film director Tim Pope has put together,
heavy on gratuitous S&M but light on any semblance of a point.  Sarah (we
assume this is the skate-punk from the first film all grown up) serves
only to give us the lovely Mia Kirshner to look at, and Pope appears far
more concerned with serving up candle-wax-on-the-nipples than creating
characters.</P>
<P>     There are plenty of individual reasons to avoid CITY OF ANGELS
(though Iggy Pop makes an ideal villain for The Crow since he looks like a
corpse himself), but it's much simpler to explain why each category of
potential viewer should stay away.  If you did not see the first film, you
probably have no interest in a dark story of vengeance with plenty of
unpleasantness. If you saw the first film and did not like it, expect more
of the same in CITY OF ANGELS, only less compelling, less artistic and
more obsessed with music video theatrics.  And if you saw the first film
and _did_ like it, do the memory of Brandon Lee a great honor and do not
let his death provide a producer with an excuse to build a franchise this
awful on his grave.</P>
