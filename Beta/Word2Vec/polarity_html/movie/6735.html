<PRE>                                 ANGEL BABY
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     ANGEL BABY is an Australian film from 1995 that swept their
equivalent of the Oscars and is just now being released in the United
States.  It tells a rarely told story about the plight of two mentally
ill people who meet and fall in love.  To preserve their new family
they will make a decision that will put both of their lives in
jeopardy.</P>
<P>     Harry and Kate meet at a group therapy session at a psychiatric
clinic referred to as "The Clubhouse."  With their medications they are
coping with life well enough so that they are outpatients rather than
residents.  Unlike the others in their circle they are both attractive
and so love naturally enters the picture.</P>
<P>     Harry is played with sincere and touching emotions by John Lynch.
He is an excellent actor who has enriched many films including: CAL,
THE SECRET GARDEN, IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH,
and MOLL FLANDERS.  This coming week I will get to see his work again
at the press screening of SOME MOTHER'S SON.</P>
<P>     Kate is played with beauty and grace by the lovely Jacqueline
McKenzie (TRAPS).  Although they both have severe emotional problems,
hers is worse so McKenzie's part proves the more challenging.  She is
convincing as a troubled woman who has natural and intense yearnings
for romance, and yes, for sex.  Their sexual relationship is shown
naturally and explicitly, but it is never sensationalized or exploited.
Confined to an important middle segment in the show, the sexual
escapade is the central thread that convinces the audience of the
strength of the lovers' commitment.</P>
<P>     First time director Michael Rymer, who also wrote the script,
weaves a story full of inner truths and high energy.  When Kate meets
Harry for the first time, she rejects him out of hand with, "I don't
hang around with psychos."</P>
<P>     Kate has help in life.  She believes that she is watched over by
her guardian angel, Astral.  Knowing that Astral is always there to
guide her is what makes Kate's life bearable.  The way Astral
communicates is the most surprising aspect of ANGEL BABY.  Kate listens
to all "Wheel of Fortune" episodes and takes copious notes since Astral
sends her messages through the game board.  This is not done for
comedic effect, but as a natural thing a mentally disturbed person
might believe.</P>
<P>     Kate has a hard getting through life.  When she is invited to eat
dinner at the home of Harry's brother Morris (Colin Friels) and his
wife Louise (Deborra-Lee Furness), they serve her chicken.  Kate keeps
losing the chicken leg as she uses a soup spoon to get the meat off the
bone.</P>
<P>     Once Harry and Kate realize how much they love each other, they
get an apartment together.  Choosing the apartment proves a challenge.
They insist on a good number, and the selection of available apartments
is limited.  Watching him get a job again as a programmer and her try
to set up house is joyfully touching.</P>
<P>     One big day she announces she is pregnant.  How does she know asks
Harry.  Easy, the "Wheel of Fortune" answers for the day were: "Great
Expectations" and "Big as a blimp."  She should get tested, but she
does not trust the doctor recommended by her psychiatrist.  He asks
her, "Would you prefer to see another doctor?"  She retorts, "Yes, Dr.
Seuss."</P>
<P>     Harry thinks the answer to their troubles and to their fear of
birth defects because of their heavy medication lies in, "no more junk
food, no more coffee, and no medications."  For someone with their
mental disorders, this is a recipe for death.</P>
<P>     Up until this point the show had been touching and serious but
upbeat.  From the quotes and the situations you may think it is funny,
but actually it is not.  After they stop their medications, all hell
breaks loose, but the director carefully keeps his actors in line.
Most would have been content to let them overact so they could have
complete artistic freedom.</P>
<P>     By the end of the film, I was reduced to tears.  This is a tragedy
that is never manipulative and always genuine, and the heartfelt acting
makes it a powerful movie.</P>
<P>     ANGEL BABY runs 1:45.  It is not rated but would get an R for the
sex, nudity, and profanity. The film would be fine for serious and
older teenagers.  I recommend the movie to you and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
