<P>With the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up, loading
their guns, kissing each other and uttering what sounds like "Rock and
Roll!" (actually, it's "lock and load"), you can't help thinking
Tarantino.  And of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in
love who turn to violent bank robbery, the film unapologetically takes
its place alongside all those other films from BONNIE & CLYDE to
NATURAL BORN KILLERS.   But if most of those movies have their roots in
pulp fiction, exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run,
NORMAL LIFE takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the
phenomenon.  "Inspired by true events" -- we've heard that one before,
and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly
demonstrated ... or so strangely poignant.  For this is a story of real
people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality, who in their
search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged.</P>
<P>Beginning with their final arrest, the film goes back to trace the
relationship between Chris (Luke Perry), a policeman, and Pam (Ashley
Judd), a factory worker. They fall in love and marry, but Pam's
increasingly erratic behaviour (going on spending sprees, slashing
herself with a knife after an argument) begin to trouble the solid and
stable Chris.  When Chris gets sacked, they find themselves heavily in
debt and near breaking up.  Then, Chris begins to rob banks ...</P>
<P>Luke Perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly
forget that he was ever in Beverly Hills 90210 or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE
SLAYER.  Moustached, with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and
eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation, he is perfectly cast
as the long-suffering husband. (It's another of John McNaughton's coups
of casting-against-type, after transforming Robert de Niro into nerd
and Bill Murray into gangster in MAD DOG AND GLORY).</P>
<P>But it is the character of Pam who commands centrestage, and Ashley
Judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity
and tenderness, making Pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating
person.  If the performance falls short of greatness, however, it is
perhaps because the role of the Mad Woman has been done so often before
it is virtually a staple of cinema, whether it's in BETTY BLUE, TOM &
VIV or GEORGIA.  As in those movies, there's the danger that the
performance seems mannered, a collection of screwy tics and tantrums
designed for the Oscar presentation piece.  Judd doesn't entirely avoid
this pitfall, but Pam's 'craziness' is best and most movingly presented
in counterpoint to the more 'normal' Chris.  When Pam reacts to her
father-in-law's death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and
blaring headphones, Chris' face is the picture of pained restraint.</P>
<P>Of course, it's the question of what is 'normal' that is asked in
NORMAL LIFE.  McNaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the
aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with
insanity.  It is the rational Chris that loves guns ("Shooting is about
precision, control") and the 'crazy' Pam that loves astronomy and
yearns for a dog (who is then called Chaos -- "Chaos and you and me
...  we're a real family", she notes wryly).  It is Chris' methodical
mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a
successful bank robber (his well-planned disguise as a bearded, roaring
man of terror is another piece of Method in madness).   In the carpark
where he sets out for his first robbery, a huge sign on a shopping mall
stands out in the background :"BUY-MORE" -- the perfectly respectable
consumption-crazy American dream that has driven Pam to her extravagant
purchases, and both of them into desperate situations.</P>
<P>It's not a perfect film. Some of the dialogue is a touch too banal
(perhaps intentionally?).  The use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in
Pam's crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional
disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from
the rest of the film.  Indeed, as in McNaughton's seminal film HENRY :
PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, it is the avoidance of glamour or
sensationalism, the denial of some of the standard thrills of the
outlaw film genre, that gives this determinedly unflashy, moving film
its great strengths.</P>
<P>McNaughton has filmed this story with a quiet, coolly 'realistic'
method that works far better than any NBK theatrics at unsettling the
viewer.  The suburbs, with their miles of white-fenced houses and
identikit malls, take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness. In its
very different way, this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide
open spaces in Terence Malick's BADLANDS.  While Pam shares the
yearnings of Malick's heroes to escape from ordinary life, Chris takes
up crime precisely so that they can lead a 'normal life' - their little
house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies.  But these
are dreams defined by, constrained by, and even doomed by, the
limitations of the 'normal', conventional world.  Pam's final scene
takes place at the edge of the suburbs, where wild bushes grow --
symbolically the frontier, the outer limits of her society, but also
quite literally the end of the road, where there is nowhere left to go
but to the final tragic denouement.</P>
<P>THE FLYING INKPOT's rating system:
 * Wait for the video.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
