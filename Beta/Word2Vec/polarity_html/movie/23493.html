<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Spike Lee's take on the the summer of 1977 in New York City, a time when
a serial killer was on the loose, causing a panic by killing couples in
lovers lane. The film has its rewarding moments to counter its muddled
attempt to cover what actually happened. David Berkowitz, the Son of
Sam, was eventually apprehended due to a parking ticket that was traced
to him.</P>
<P>But Spike is not that concerned with the serial killer, his perspective
of the event is how it influenced an Italian Bronx neighborhood,
bringing out its paranoia. The most interesting character in the film is
not David Berkowitz, but Vinny (Leguizamo) from the Bronx, a
hairdresser, someone of a working-class mentality and someone who is
possessed with a weak character. He is also someone who has adapted to
his neighborhood's provincial attitudes, trusting only Italians who
think like he does. It is through his tortured eyes that the viewer sees
how a lynch mob mentality unfolds in a neighborhood, how sexually
repressed the Catholic is, and how God is seen as someone who will make
you pay for your sins. Vinny's sins are due to his repressions, refusing
to have oral sex with his wife because his wife shouldn't do such
things. He has oral sex on his extra-marital affairs, which is his
excuse for having the affairs. He was almost the target of the serial
killer on the night he made it with his wife's cousin and is now
guilt-ridden and thinks he has to change his ways, that God gave him one
more chance by sparing his life in favor of the other couple that was
killed that night.</P>
<P>It was at times a film that bordered on greatness, but then for long
stretches turned back into a mess, filled with untenable stereotypes of
the Italians, while losing track of its story about the psycho
..44-Caliber Killer. It suffered from being too long (142 minutes), from
failing to say anything relevant about the Son of Sam, and from being
too ambitious. Son of Sam was unintentionally portrayed in a comic
manner as he was madly talking to a barking black dog named Harvey,
suffering from fits of ranting to himself, and hearing delusionary
voices. Michael Badalucco's characterization added nothing to the story
except disappointment that his character wasn't even attempted to be
explored. He was a caricature; we know nothing more about him from this
film than the New Yorkers did from the police sketches of him placed in
the newspapers to identify him.</P>
<P>Summer of Sam concentrates its energy on two young Italian-American
couples from the Bronx. The first couple is married for two years:
Dionna (Mira) is a waitress in her father's Italian restaurant; Vinny is
her philandering husband, who can't stop himself from cheating on her.
They both share a love for disco and the night-life. The second couple
is made up of two lost souls who don't quite fit into the neighborhood
but haven't been able to get away from the neighborhood. Ritchie (Brody)
has just returned from England to live with his mother (Patti LuPone)
and new step-father (Mike Starr), who upset him greatly by kicking him
out of the house to live in the garage. He has returned with an
affective accent imitative of the Sex Pistols, with spiked hair, and
wearing a dog collar. The local girl he befriends is named Ruby
(Jennifer Esposito), better known on the street as Ruby the Skank. She
joins Ritchie into forming a punk-rock duo--providing a contrast to the
disco marriage of Dionna and Vinny's. Ritchie also has a secret life as
a male performer in a gay theater on 42nd St. known as Male World and
turning gay tricks to get some money to buy an expensive guitar. When
this news hits the neighborhood, it is too much for the locals to
handle, even his best friend Vinny turns against him. All the male leads
seem to lead inexplicable double lives.</P>
<P>The film derives its verve from the Daily News headlines of the mounting
number of couples killed by the serial killer that summer. We hear Phil
Rizzuto covering the Yankee championship baseball season on radio and
the team's star, Reggie Jackson, is amusingly connected by one of the
neighborhood boys to the killings because his uniform number is 44.
Jimmy Breslin fills us in on the Daily News coverage, where he was a
reporter at that time, even receiving a letter from Son of Sam. Spike
acts as a black TV reporter who is pleasing to the white audience (in a
performance that proves he has no ability as an actor). There is a Con
Ed blackout in the record hot summer days of July, which causes looting
in Harlem, while in contrast, the local mafia chiefs keep the white
neighborhood looter-free.</P>
<P>Much like in Fritz Lang's M, as the police are baffled by the killer and
go to the underworld to get help, here they will go to Luigi (Gazzara),
who is the local mafia chief. He puts up a reward to get the killer and
then puts together a list of those he suspects might be the pervert.
Added to the mix of those on the look out for the Son of Sam, are the
local Italian wiseguys, who hang out by a sign that says Dead-End. Joey
T (Rispoli) is the tough leader of this group, a low-level drug dealer
who has a daughter and tries to keep his neighborhood free of social
undesirables, yet is completely unconscious that what he is doing is
paradoxical. Vinny and Ritchie are part of the group as youngsters
growing up, but trouble arises when the group suspects Ritchie of
changing so much that he could be the Son of Sam. Meanwhile, Vinny's
life seems to be unraveling and he is too confused and drugged up to
understand what is going on. It seems as if he in a clash over
pop-cultures (disco and punk) with his best friend Ritchie.</P>
<P>It's a messy film, moving in many different directions, but it is filled
with ideas and is always engaging. The lead performers Leguizamo, Brody,
Esposito, Sorvino, and Rispoli give crisp performances. Leguizamo's
performance is special in a visceral way, it exposes his double-standard
life and his lowlife mindset, his rage is what the film keys in on. The
film doesn't really come to a climax or say anything new about society
at large, but it has an excitement of its own that is grandiose. That's
about as complimentary as I can get about a film that should be praised
more than it should be lambasted for its faults. It should be praised
for showing how scared people are of those who are different and how
they need to blame someone for what they don't understand. The scene
near the end of the film was particularly violent and revolting, giving
the film the jolt it needed to make its case about those who are narrow
minded.</P>
<P>This was not a film, after all, about the killer, its victims, or about
the summer of 1977, it was a film about those who were victimized
because they are made into scapegoats for someone else's problems that
they can't face themselves. It is a film about urban white people of
Italian origin: their fears, their angers, their prejudices, their
repressions, and their eroticisms. Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing) keeps
the African-American view to the summer of 1977 down to the bare
minimum. He shows the killings of Son of Sam in their gruesome aspects,
but that is not the only horror going on in the city, therefore little
is made of the serial killings. It almost seems as if the story about
the Son of Sam was not even needed. This was a film almost exclusively
about an Italian neighborhood and their xenophobia, and it could have
taking place in any year after 1950.</P>
