<P>     CONTACT is likely to change a lot of perceptions -- not only about 
the role of humankind in the universe, but about what special effects 
can do for a movie when they're used in the service of a story, rather 
than the other way around.  CONTACT is that rare big-budget motion 
picture that places ideas, characters, and plot above everything else.  
The film takes the richness of astronomer Carl Sagan's bestselling 1985 
novel and re-invents it for the screen, retaining all the power and 
fascination of the book while adding a visual aspect that will not 
disappoint devoted fans.  CONTACT is as close as recent Hollywood 
productions have come to a perfect example of cinema.  All the elements 
are not only in place, but effectively realized.  This is the kind of 
motion picture that restores one's faith in what can be produced when a 
large budget is used wisely.</P>
<P>     The participation of a superlative cast and crew doesn't always 
guarantee success, but, in this case, the high expectations have been 
met.  On the acting side, CONTACT stars two-time Oscar winner Jodie 
Foster alongside rising star Matthew McConaughey and veterans James 
Woods and Tom Skerritt.  The film is directed and co-produced by Robert 
Zemeckis, whose last effort was 1994's box office smash, FORREST GUMP.  
And, until his death in December 1996, Sagan served as a story 
consultant and scientific advisor.  </P>
<P>     As an on-again/off-again amateur astronomer, one of the first 
things I noticed about the film was its technical accuracy.  This is 
undoubtedly the result of Sagan's influence.  All the details are 
correct (at least as far as I was able to determine); there are none of 
the movie cop-outs that film makers occasionally resort to in order to 
lower the intelligence level of the script.  CONTACT is believable in 
part because it doesn't replace true science with vague terms and 
gobbledygook.  In his novel, Sagan was careful to make everything, even 
the most farfetched parts, theoretically feasible.  Although the movie 
changes and condenses significant aspects of the original material, it 
remains true to this vision.</P>
<P>     CONTACT opens with an unforgettable sequence that takes the viewer 
on a tour of the universe.  It starts out in a familiar corner of space, 
with Earth filling the screen.  Then, constantly accelerating, we pull 
back.  The moon passes, then Mars.  We zip through the asteroid belt, 
then speed past Jupiter, through the rings of Saturn, and out into 
places beyond.  Once the Oort cloud is behind us, we careen past stars 
and galaxies, proceeding ever farther away from our home solar system.  
It's an amazing trip that only takes several minutes, but presages the 
wonders that CONTACT's final half-hour holds for the viewer.</P>
<P>     After this eye-popping trek, we return to Earth during the early 
1970s, where we meet 9-year old Ellie Arroway (Jena Malone), a budding 
scientist with a fascination for short wave radio (she likes hearing 
messages from far away) and astronomy.  Her father, Ted (David Morse), 
is an English teacher, and has schooled Ellie in the beauty of the 
stars.  Following his sudden death, an event that leaves Ellie orphaned, 
she decides to devote her entire life to pursuing the mysteries that her 
father opened her eyes to.</P>
<P>     When we next encounter Ellie (now played by Jodie Foster), she's a 
promising researcher for the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial 
Intelligence) Institute, working on a giant radio telescope in Puerto 
Rico.  Ellie's obsession is to find evidence of life on another planet.  
Despite the scorn of her colleagues, she spends hours on end listening 
for that proof.  While in Puerto Rico, she becomes involved with a 
religious scholar, Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey).  The two have a 
short, passionate affair that ends when Ellie's former mentor (and the 
President's national science advisor), David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt), 
pulls the plug on the SETI project in Puerto Rico.  To maintain her 
work, Ellie is forced to seek private funding, which she receives from a 
multi-billionaire eccentric named S.R. Hadden (John Hurt).  Armed with 
as much money as she needs, Ellie rents time on New Mexico's VLA (very 
large array) radio telescope range, and, while there, discovers a 
message from the star Vega that indicates intelligent life.  Once the 
signal is confirmed, the VLA becomes the center of a media blitz, and, 
along with the reporters, National Security Advisor Michael Kitz (James 
Woods) arrives, ready to militarize the project and push Ellie out.</P>
<P>     Although CONTACT is rightfully being billed as the story of 
humanity's first encounter with an extraterrestrial life form, at its 
heart, it's really more about Ellie and her quest for meaning in life.  
In her own words:  "For as long as I can remember, I've been searching 
for some reason why we're here -- what we're doing here, who are we?"  
Ellie's trajectory places her on a collision course with answers to 
those questions, and it's the development of her character, and the 
resolution of this particular aspect of the story, that makes for a 
satisfying conclusion.  In the end, the science fiction elements become 
subordinate to the personal ones.</P>
<P>     In its own unique way, CONTACT offers a little bit of almost 
everything:  drama, romance, suspense, and science fiction.  It touches 
the emotions and the intellect.  There are glorious special effects, 
wonderful acting, and a couple of impressive pyrotechnic displays.  The 
plot contains the most believable approach to this subject matter ever 
presented in a movie.  In addition to the scientific aspect, there's the 
media feeding frenzy, the fierce in-fighting to gain control of the 
project, the international ramifications of the U.S. taking charge, and 
the religious implications of life on another planet.  One of the key, 
recurring struggles presented in CONTACT is that of science versus 
religion, and how the conflict between these two seemingly-divergent 
disciplines reveals the importance of both faith and facts to human 
well-being.</P>
<P>     As he did in FORREST GUMP, Robert Zemeckis makes excellent use of 
special effects.  The standout sequences are those that take place in 
deep space and give us an awe-inspiring perception of how incredibly 
vast the universe is.  But digital trickery, both subtle and obvious, is 
used on other occasions, as well.  In fact, Zemeckis returns to one of 
his most talked-about GUMP gimmicks as he puts words into the mouth of 
President Clinton.  By carefully editing clips of Clinton speeches and 
using a little creative dubbing, Zemeckis makes it seem like the 
President is directly addressing the specific situations that arise 
during the course of CONTACT.</P>
<P>     The cast is strong.  Tom Skerritt and James Woods take what could 
have been one-dimensional characters and develop them into something 
more.  We don't exactly sympathize with them, but we understand their 
viewpoints.  Matthew McConaughey's performance is nicely-understated; 
it's easy to accept him as a charismatic, sincere, New Age religious 
leader.  But the star of the film is Jodie Foster, who brings all of her 
considerable ability to the part of Ellie, and infuses the character 
with passion, intelligence, and courage.  Foster deserves another Oscar 
nomination for her work here.</P>
<P>     In its approach and discernment, CONTACT couldn't be farther from a 
number of recent "first contact" motion pictures (including, but not 
limited to, INDEPENDENCE DAY, STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT, and THE 
ARRIVAL).  Instead, in different ways, this movie recalls some of the 
best science fiction films.  It has a measure of the awe and spectacle 
of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and an element of the mystery and hope offered 
by CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.  In fact, CONTACT can stand on 
the same level as these and many other classics, and that is one 
definition of a great movie.  If CONTACT falls short in any area, it's 
an inability to fully develop all of its many subplots, but, given the 
time limitations of the medium (the running length is already 2:30), 
that's understandable.  This is one of 1997's finest motion pictures, 
and is a forceful reminder that Hollywood is still capable of making 
magic.</P>
