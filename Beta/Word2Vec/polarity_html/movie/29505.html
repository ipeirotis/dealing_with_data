<P>With his last two films - Shine and Snow Falling on Cedars - Australian 
director Scott Hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the 
best out there, and his latest, Hearts in Atlantis, is no different.  Its 
structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in 
the middle - is similar to The Green Mile, which is a bit ironic considering 
both were based on Stephen King books.  The parallels don't end there, 
either.  Atlantis was adapted by William Goldman, who had previously penned 
the big-screen version of Misery and is in the process of working on the 
script for King's Dreamcatcher.  Even the film's content is a bit 
reminiscent of Mile.  In fact, it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s 
nostalgia of Stand By Me (also by King) and mystical power hokum of Mile. </P>
<P>King's Atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories, but the 
main focus here is on the first (and longest) tale, called Low Men in Yellow 
Coats (the film's title comes from the second chapter).  It's set in 1960 
Harwich, Connecticut, where 11-year-old Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin) lives 
in a boarding house run by his cold, self-centered mother Elizabeth (Hope 
Davis, Joe Gould's Secret), who seems to care more about her wardrobe than 
her son.  Bobby spends his time with his two closest friends, John Sullivan 
(Will Rothhaar) and tomboy Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem), who become something 
like the Kevin, Paul and Winnie of Harwich. </P>
<P>When a new tenant moves into the vacant room, the fatherless Bobby finds a 
male role model in Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins, Hannibal), a mysterious 
stranger who is vague enough about his past to make Bobby's mom suspicious 
enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror.  Ted 
teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature (after his 
cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday), dispenses 
prophetic words of wisdom and even pays Bobby one dollar a week to read him 
the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the Low Men, a group of 
people chasing Ted to exploit his special powers.  I won't go into what 
these powers are, but they're considerably toned down from the book (and 
don't involve black stuff flying out of Ted's mouth, a la Mile). </P>
<P>Atlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the 
novel's final chapter, titled Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling, and 
features David Morse (in yet another connection to The Green Mile) as a 
married, middle-aged Bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood 
friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his 
formative years. </P>
<P>Atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as Hicks' Cedars, which is disappointing 
but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing Robert 
Richardson to the occasionally amazing Piotr Sobocinski, the Oscar-nominated 
cinematographer behind Krzysztof Kieslowski's Red.  The acting is solid from 
everyone, including Hopkins, who never once makes you think of Dr. Lecter. 
Most impressive are youngsters Yelchin and Boorem, who both had tiny parts 
in Along Came a Spider. </P>
<P>While I didn't really have much of a problem with Goldman's screenplay, I do 
need to point out at least one inconsistency.  Goldman, for those of you who 
don't read Premiere, writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody 
else's films, carefully explaining why they all suck, make no sense and 
insult their audiences, while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's 
penned (like The General's Daughter).  It's mean-spirited but fun to read, 
mostly on account of nobody else in Hollywood having the balls to say 
anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business (including 
Michael Jackson, O.J. and Robert Blake).  In Atlantis, which is supposed to 
be told through the eyes of young Bobby, one would assume he would have to 
be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back. Well, 
he's not, and it doesn't make sense. </P>
<P>1:41 - PG-13 for violence and thematic elements</P>
