<PRE>                              SWITCHBACK
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     Inauspicious beginnings have doomed many a film.  So it is with
first time director Jeb Stuart's SWITCHBACK.  Stuart seems to believe
that films must telegraph their punches or else they will lose the
audience.</P>
<P>     SWITCHBACK opens with the classic a-stranger-is-in-the-house scene
so popular in slasher movies and cheap thrillers.  And to make sure
that he hooks the audience, Stuart, who wrote the script for SWITCHBACK
as well as much better films such as THE FUGITIVE, carefully includes a
child endangerment aspect to the opening.  Finally, to make sure that
he has everyone's complete attention, he switches next to a gruesome
scene in a far away motel of a pair of bright red, sliced bodies in a
bathtub.</P>
<P>     The movie stars Dennis Quaid as rogue FBI agent Frank LaCrosse.
Frank spends the movie on the lam from his own bureau while he tracks
down a serial killer.  Although the FBI thinks it already has the
killer, Frank remains convinced that the motel killings were the old
serial killer's handiwork.  Like many movie killers, this one has a
personal vendetta against Frank, the agent who was in charge.  Of
course, the killer has genius tendencies as well as tremendous good
luck.</P>
<P>     Quaid, who frequently has trouble demonstrating much dynamic range
as actor, approaches his role in this film with a singleness of
purpose.  His vision of an angry agent affords only one expression, a
hangdog frown that looks like someone suffering from constant gas.  And
his terse elocution borders on parody.  Absent his performance and with
a director more adept at staging scenes, the movie would have been much
better.  (When in doubt, Stuart calls out the stuntmen to hang off of
some cliff in a snowy wilderness so as to distract our attention from
the problems in the storyline.)</P>
<P>     The supporting cast almost carries the show.  The best is R. Lee
Ermey (the police captain in SEVEN) who plays Buck Olmstead, a cagey
Amarillo, Texas sheriff, who becomes Frank's lone supporter.  "He told
the truth, and once you tell the truth, everything else is just cheap
whiskey," Buck says with homespun wisdom about his belief in Frank's
veracity.  Easily the most likable character in the story, Buck is
willing to put his career on the line to assist his friends.</P>
<P>     While the FBI chases their own agent, who in turns searches for
the elusive killer, a parallel story has the film's only two visible
suspects driving around in the snow.  Jared Leto, playing ex-doctor
Lane Dixon, has a scene in which he cuts open a man's throat to save
his life almost exactly like the beginning scene in PLAYING GOD.  Lane
actually dropped out while he was an intern, but his skills with a
knife makes him an instant suspect.</P>
<P>     One night Lane makes what appears to be a bad decision and hitches
a ride in a '77 Caddy.  Bob Goodall, the car's owner, has decorated
every inch of his automobile with pictures of naked women -- even the
seat belts are covered.  Bob explains how he designed nuddie upholstery
so that he could slip a picture out when he got tired of one of his
"honies" and put in a new picture.  Danny Glover, who has a penchant
for bad film choices, GONE FISHIN' being his most recent disaster,
plays Bob with wild eyes and great glee.  Bob is a suspect because he
loves to threaten people with his knife, and because he acts too
friendly.  Then again, one learns in films of this caliber never to
discount the minor character or even the one not yet seen as the
killer.</P>
<P>     SWITCHBACK runs too long at 2:01.  It is rated R for violence,
profanity, and pinup pictures.  The film would be fine for most
teenagers.</P>
