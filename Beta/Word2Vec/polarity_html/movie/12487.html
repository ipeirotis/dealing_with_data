<P>     CHARACTER, the winner of the 1998 Oscar for Best Foreign Language 
Film, is a fine motion picture about the relationships within a 
dysfunctional family in the Netherlands during the 1930s.  Even though 
the movie is set three-quarters of a century after Charles Dickens 
penned his final novel, CHARACTER has the feel of something written by 
the beloved Victorian author, with perhaps a little Franz Kafka mixed in 
for good measure.  </P>
<P>     The film tells the story of Katadreuffe (Fedja Van Huet), a young 
man who has made his mark in the world despite the conspiracy of 
numerous, diverse forces to keep him suppressed.  As a child, he wasn't 
an orphan, but he might as well have been.  His unmarried mother, Joba 
(Betty Schuurman), is a harsh, unloving woman who rarely speaks to her 
son.  His father, Dreverhaven (Jan Decleir), is the city's most detested 
bailiff, whose motto is "the law without compassion."  After being 
rejected by Joba, Dreverhaven wants nothing to do with his son, and 
works actively to place obstacles in his path.  The struggle between 
Katadreuffe and Dreverhaven turns into a personal war of attrition.  
This fuels Katadreuffe's single-minded goal to rise through the legal 
system, but costs him a chance at true happiness.</P>
<P>     Through his entire life, Katadreuffe is impelled by a need to 
escape from the shame of his birth and upbringing.  He uses 
Dreverhaven's contempt as a catalyst to push himself harder.  Dr. De 
Gankelaar (Victor Low), a lawyer who represents Katadreuffe in a 
bankruptcy hearing, sees great potential in the young man, and takes him 
on as an assistant.  From there, using money borrowed from Dreverhaven's 
bank, Katadreuffe applies himself exclusively to his studies in law.  
Unfortunately, his lack of social experience causes him to miss the 
subtle signs of attraction being exhibited by a co-worker (Tamar van den 
Dop), thereby ruining his lone opportunity at a happy marriage.</P>
<P>     Although Katadreuffe is CHARACTER's protagonist, the most 
fascinating individual in the film is Dreverhaven, who is played with a 
combination of malice and world-weariness by veteran actor Jan Decleir 
(ANTONIA'S LINE).  Dreverhaven's motives are far more complex than those 
of a typical villain.  Underneath his cold, harsh exterior, he is 
tortured by inner demons and permanently scarred by the sting of his 
rejected marriage proposal.  His feelings towards his son are unclear -- 
a mixture of shame, anger, bitterness, and, curiously, perhaps even 
pride.  He claims that his financial assault is designed to strengthen 
Katadreuffe's character ("I'll strangle him for nine-tenths, and the 
last tenth will make him strong," he states at one point), but it's 
really an attempt to assert control and prove his superiority.  Despite 
all of his money and his respected position in society, Dreverhaven is 
filled with self-loathing and a disgust with the odious process of 
living.  He risks his life frequently, causing many to wonder whether 
he's brave or seeking his own death.</P>
<P>     Dickensian elements abound, from the travails of the poverty-
stricken masses to the struggles of an (almost) orphan.  Director Mike 
van Diem has crafted the look of Rotterdam in the 1930s to resemble 
London of a century earlier (just replace the motor cars with horses-
and-buggies).  Politics play a small-but-important role in the film as 
Katadreuffe enjoys a brief flirtation with the communist movement, which 
stands in direct opposition to Dreverhaven and all that he stands for.  
Ultimately, everything comes down to the relationship between 
Katadreuffe and Dreverhaven, and the manner in which their constant 
power struggle shapes their futures.</P>
<P>     Actually, as it turns out, Dreverhaven doesn't have a future.  The 
film, which is structured as a series of flashbacks, starts with 
Katadreuffe being brought in for questioning by the police after 
Dreverhaven has been found murdered.  Unfortunately, this approach 
allows director Mike van Diem to employ one of my least-liked narrative 
techniques -- the voice-over.  And, as is almost always the case with 
this device, it is overused. </P>
<P>     While CHARACTER tells an interesting story with well-developed 
characters, its Academy Awards victory is somewhat irksome, since I 
found it to be inferior to fellow nominee, BEYOND SILENCE.  Since both 
films are destined to receive some sort of distribution, viewers will be 
able to decide for themselves which is the better movie.  However, 
regardless of which one you prefer, one thing is certainly clear:  
CHARACTER and BEYOND SILENCE offer the kind of emotional depth and 
resonance that has become rare in Hollywood productions.  </P>
