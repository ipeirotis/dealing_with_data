<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>M: I-2, the sequel to Mission Impossible, is a James Bond wannabe film,
but it fails to even come close to that film in wit, humor, and
entertainment value. It tries to be a spy/romance movie, but without any
suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes
who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses. It is a film that
prefers techie gadgets to anything human. The coolest thing about this
movie, was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing
about the movie, was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols. The
film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence.
Except for the choreographed action sequences, the film was dull for
three-quarters of its time, filled with too many dead spots in its story
to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance
that developed. As for the action scenes, they might look good to those
who are converts to violence in their films, but their advertisement for
sadistic responses, is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence, which
makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off
by the gratuitous cruelty seen.</P>
<P>M: I-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes, but it is hard to
get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue. The film
looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus, at that point. The
only thing that kept me awake, was the horrible music composed by Hans
Zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous
action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more
noticeable in the wrong way.</P>
<P>It's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry TV
series. But its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish
because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it, and it
failed to produce a story that had any substance. John Woo ("Broken
Arrow" /"Face/Off") is good at doing car chases, choreographed fights
with midair flips and kung-fu kicks, slo-mo shots of two guns blazing,
and of fire explosions, but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and
suspense. The star of the film and co-producer, Tom Cruise, and his
romantic interest, Thandie Newton, are miscast. Cruise is no James Bond
and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair
and innocuous smile, as he tries to carry off this macho role, while
Thandie is not an action-film girl, and seems like a fish- out-of-water
in this one. Their romance didn't work, not only was it tepid and not
sexy, but it wasn't convincing.</P>
<P>The film opens with dizzying speed, perhaps with the hope that a
befuddled audience is its best bet for success. We will be in three
different locations instantaneously: Sydney, the American Southwest, and
Seville. First, we are in Sydney, Australia, where a scientist with a
muffled Russian accent, Dr. Nekhorvich (Rade), mentions that he created
a deadly killer virus called Chimera and an antidote for it. He also
mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain. Which explains the
film's mythic theme...as we enter the world of comic book myths on good
and evil.</P>
<P>The one who played the villain, Dougray Scott, does so in a
one-dimensional gruff tone, which did not distinguish him in that role.
At least, if the film got the villain part right, it might have had some
fun with this nonsense.</P>
<P>Soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts
called Dimitri, but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set
it on automatic pilot and crash it into the Rocky Mountains. Before they
crash the plane and parachute out of it, the one who was posing as
Dimitri, turns out to be Sean Ambrose (Scott), a rogue member of the
IMF, which is a CIA-like clone. He steals the package with the antidote,
peels off a latex mask, which is a replica of the hero of the story,
Ethan Hunt (Cruise), who had posed as Dimitri to the scientist before
and had thereby gained his trust. Sean and his group of terrorists carry
out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then
to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices.</P>
<P>We already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in Face/Off and in the
original Mission Impossible, which as convoluted a plot as that film
had, it was still a superior film to this sequel. Woo has run this
peeling mask routine into the ground, as it is used so often in this
film by both sides, so much so, that it blurs any ethical character
differences between good guy or villain. It makes it seem as if anyone
could be another character, which distorts the reality of the film and
makes it impossible for the film to make much sense.</P>
<P>Next we are in a mountain range in the American Southwest, and Ethan is
on vacation, hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool,
when a helicopter with his boss Anthony Hopkins aboard, delivers via a
rocket launcher, a pair of talking sunglasses. Hunt learns his next
mission is to retrieve the Chimera package and he is allowed to pick two
regular IMF agents to help, Billy Baird (John Polson) and Luther
Stickell (Ving Rhames), with Luther running a high-gadget computer, but
he also must get a jewel thief named Nyah Hall (Thandie) to join his
team. He is told, as an incentive to recruit her, all her criminal
charges will be dropped. Hopkins then signs off with the tag line:This
message will self-destruct in five seconds. Actually, with the departure
of Hopkins, it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at
this point.</P>
<P>In Seville, Hunt recruits Nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel
heist and a subsequent car chase, where he nearly runs her Audi sports
car over the side of a mountain road. He also falls for her when this
was only supposed to be a business deal, and learns that she is valuable
because her ex-boyfriend was Sean Ambrose and that he still wants to
f*ck her. The IMF team then inject a location tracer chip into her to
spot Sean so she can go f*ck him, as she leads them to his hide-out in
the seaside of Australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous
cohort, the South African, Hugh Stamp (Richard Roxburgh).</P>
<P> Robert Towne, the screenwriter, who contributed to the first "Mission,"
who is noted for doing "Chinatown" --  writes a colorless, pedestrian
script, one that fails even to be funny in a camp way.</P>
<P>The terrorists, who aim to rule the world, are interested in owning 51
percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options, as they plan
to infect Sydney with the virus and have their company sell the
antidote, insuring that they will make billions on the stock.</P>
<P>Ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of Nyah, with his only
conflict being who is more important to save first. Ethan does this
rescue against all odds, as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight
biotech company, fight it out with Sean and the other terrorists, and
rescue Nyah, who injected herself with the virus to hinder Sean's
getting it, as the only way to transport the virus is through another
person or from the vaccine needle. Ethan rescues her by doing stunt
riding on a motorcycle, using kick-boxing, winning a shootout, throwing
a full John Wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists, making some more
use out of that peeling mask bit, and by being completely fearless and
larger than life, while he kick's everyone's ass. If I was only
entertained by this...I could have lived with it. But this film was so
badly made, that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball
game, seeing only the slam-dunks, but with  the game itself being
excluded from the telecast. In any case, this is a critic-proof film,
and will in all probability do well in the box office, as it was made to
appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this
one easy to buy into.</P>
