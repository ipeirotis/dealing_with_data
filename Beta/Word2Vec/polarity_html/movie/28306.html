<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A good spoof on the church, but it is ruined by its vulgarity, excesses
and absurdity. The ensemble cast is made up of many stars in cameo
roles, but that does not guarantee that the acting is good. This black
comedy premiered on Cinemax cable TV after the film's controversial
religious themes prevented it from getting a distribution deal with a
U.S. studio. Even if there was no controversy, this film is too weird
and too poorly put together to deserve a theater release.</P>
<P>Tex (Woody Allen) is married to an ex-lap dancer, the beautiful Candy
(Stone), but they have to split NYC because the mob's after her. They
move to Texas, where he becomes a kosher butcher. He's so much in love
with her that he would kill for love. When he finds that his wife is
unfaithful, he puts a chain saw to her and dismembers her. His wife's
dismembered hand falls out of his truck as he's on the road to bury her
chopped up body parts, and when a blind woman (Lupe) picks up the hand,
with the long middle finger protruding in an obscene gesture, she
miraculously regains her sight. The New Mexico town of El Nino learns of
this miracle and attributes the hand to being the Virgin's. Other locals
come to pray before it and make requests for miracles: an amputee has
his legs restored, a flat-chested girl gets big tits, a midget gets a
big dick, a teenager with acne is cured, and so on. The town made of
misfits and a corrupt mayor (Cheech) and a thriving prostitution trade,
exploits this miracle and it overnight becomes known as the place with
the hottest shrine in the world. The tourists flock here in droves and
everyone in this once poor town is thriving.</P>
<P>The local padre, Father Leo Jerome (Schwimmer), is having a torrid
affair with the hottest prostitute in town, Desi (Cucinotta). He has
lost belief in his religion and doesn't know how to stop this miracle
farce from continuing, especially when the church sends its miracle
investigators (Gould, Drescher, and Dick) there and they confirm that it
must be the hand of a saint. It is their belief, that they should not
ruin a good thing that the church has going for it. Besides the priest,
the mayor also knows the hand is that of a murdered woman; but, he
doesn't want to spoil the town's financial boon.</P>
<P>It all comes to a head, when Sheriff Bobo (Kiefer Sutherland) from Texas
comes to arrest Tex for killing his wife. He's upset that the butcher
killed the best lay that he ever had. The film is a series of sight
gags, nasty one-liners, pronouncements against the church, and awkward
comic scenes. Most of it is inane, but one of its good moments is when
it is said: a good reason for keeping the hand as a miracle, is that it
gives people a religious belief in the hereafter and because of that
they would be nicer to each other.</P>
<P>It is directed with reckless abandon by Alfonso Arau (Like Water for
Chocolate/A Walk in the Clouds), with a disarming heavy-handedness and
lack of subtlety (it ends by this in-your-face statement: God is sending
a message, if you can't take a joke, go f*ck yourself). It's a strictly
for the pits film, but it did get in a few good body punches on the
church. The one I liked best is: If Jesus wasn't killed, you wouldn't
have a religion. His death is, supposedly, a good argument to keep
capital punishment.</P>
