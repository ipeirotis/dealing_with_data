<P>     Upon viewing the completed version of this film, cartoonist Robert 
Crumb, whose story it tells, informed director Terry Zwigoff, "After I 
saw it I had to go for a walk in the woods, just to clear my head.  I 
took my favorite hat off, this hat that I've had for 25 years, and I 
threw it off a cliff.  I don't want to be R. Crumb anymore."  
Considering the material, the reaction is understandable.  This is the 
sort of movie capable of prompting a viewer to question and evaluate a 
great deal more than the inner workings of a single man.  In addition to 
presenting one of the most compelling filmed documentary character 
studies of all time, CRUMB asks a lot of pointed questions about life 
and art that no one can possibly answer, least of all the misanthropic 
genius at the center of the portrait. </P>
<P>     "My work is full of sweating, nervous uneasiness, which is a big 
part of me and everybody else," says Crumb.  "Most people don't want to 
see that though, because it reminds them of inadequate parts of 
themselves."  Indeed, one of the most fascinating aspects for any viewer 
of CRUMB is to identify elements of their own personality reflected in 
what Zwigoff uncovers.  Crumb doesn't tone down his often-bizarre 
opinions just because the camera is on.  </P>
<P>     Crumb's claim to fame is founding the underground comics movement 
in 1967, when issue #1 of his "Zap Comix" was released.  Crumb is also 
the creator of the "Keep on Truckin'" logo, the artist for the LP cover 
of Big Brother and the Holding Company's CHEAP THRILLS, and the 
originator of Fritz the Cat, which Ralph Bakshi turned into the first X-
rated animated feature (a film that Crumb hates).  CRUMB, made with 
even-handed passion by Zwigoff, does not attempt to be a complete 
chronicle of the cartoonist's life.  Instead, the movie chooses to 
examine certain facets of his personality, his and others' impressions 
of his work, and the forces which contributed to the genesis of a 
product that has been called everything from satirical genius to 
pornographic filth. </P>
<P>     Through interviews with Robert Crumb, his brothers Charles and Max, 
his current wife and ex-wife, his son Jesse, and various art critics, 
Zwigoff constructs a Picasso-like image of the man and the influences 
underlying his creativity.  One of the most important of these is surely 
the dysfunctional family environment of his childhood.  With a father 
labeled by Charles as an "overbearing tyrant" and "sadistic bully", and 
a mother who became an amphetamine addict, it's no wonder that Crumb is 
filled with anger, disgust, and hate.  But, as deep as his bitterness 
runs, the artist possesses a streak of sardonic, self-deprecating humor 
that shines through.  At one point, Crumb states, "At least I hate 
myself as much as I hate anybody else."  In fact, in comparison to his 
two brothers, Crumb appears almost normal.  Charles is a manic 
depressive who takes medication to keep suicidal bouts at bay (one year 
following Zwigoff's Philadelphia interview, Charles killed himself).  
Max, a confessed sex offender, spends several hours a day meditating on 
a bed of nails.   </P>
<P>     Is Crumb a misogynist?  Probably, since, in his own words, he 
harbors inner hostility towards women.  But there's more than that to 
his work.  TIME magazine art critic Robert Hughes defends Crumb, saying 
that his work expresses fantasies that are common, but which most of us 
repress out of fear.  Mother Jones editor Deidre English has a different 
view, indicating that Crumb's fetish for depicting overendowed, headless 
female bodies is a manifestation of his "arrested juvenile vision."  
It's even suggested that putting such fantasies on paper is "dangerous."  
Zwigoff gives both sides of the argument equal time, and never 
editorializes.  It's up to the viewer to decided which position, if 
either, he or she accepts. </P>
<P>     Is Crumb obsessed with sex?  No doubt.  Apparently, there was a 
time when he masturbated four to five times each day, and everyone seems 
to agree that he finds his own work sexually stimulating.  The 
cartoonist's views of sex may not be of the "normal" variety (just ask 
one of his ex-lovers), but he definitely enjoys certain activities.   </P>
<P>     Is Crumb disgusted with popular culture and fame?  In his own 
words, "As a teenager...I realized I was an outcast, I became a critic, 
and I've been disgusted with American culture from the time I was a kid.  
I started out by rejecting all the things that the people who rejected 
me liked, then over the years I developed a deeper analysis of these 
things."  Crumb has turned down opportunities to make hundreds of 
thousands of dollars by going mainstream.  He will not sign autographs.  
And he rejects the romantic notion of love, saying the only woman he has 
ever loved is his daughter. </P>
<P>     Whatever opinion a viewer has of Crumb at the end of this film, an 
apathetic reaction is unthinkable.  Empathy, fascination, disgust, or 
anger are all likely, but not disinterest.  R. Crumb is the sort of 
person it's impossible to ignore, and Zwigoff's film creates such an 
honest portrayal of him that some sort of response is demanded.  CRUMB 
is a rare and powerful documentary that completely absorbs the viewer 
and leaves an impression so blindingly clear that the afterimage cannot 
be blinked away even when the theater is far behind.  Crumb and his 
words will tug at the mind with all the tenacity of a pit bull tearing 
at its prey. </P>
