<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This sci-fi'er left a lot to be desired. It didn't work out in 3-D, its
original intention of how it was to be shown, as the public's taste for
that fad cooled, or in the conventional 2-D, how it was actually shown
when released. For the first 30 minutes or so I felt I was stuck in a
detention classroom for dummies (ah! those childhood memories never seem
to go away), as there was one pedantic lecture after another trying to
explain the secret experimental work being done underground in a New
Mexico lab with five different levels of depth and a giant mirror out
front to deflect the sun's rays, that if directed upon a target would
easily burn it up. A weapon that was reputed to be more potent than the
H-Bomb, and something that America, the good guys, were going to put up
in outer space so that they could control the world from their enemies.</P>
<P>Ivan Tors is the producer and the one who wrote the story that the film
is based on. He also foisted his wife, Constance Dowling, on the film as
the lead actress. Her problem was that she was stiffer than a stiff in
her romantic role, as Joanna Merritt. She is a plant from Washington,
spying for them about what is happening on the secret project. She
previously had a romantic relationship with the lead investigator, Dr.
David Sheppard (Egan), who was just flown in at the request of the
center's director Dr. Van Ness (Herbert Marshall). Her job now becomes
to help Dr. Sheppard track down the mysterious malfunctions taking place
at the center. This was the last film she appeared in, after a brief
film career, working previously as a Samuel Goldwyn girl.</P>
<P>During these Cold War years, machines were regarded with apprehension by
the public, who were worried that the enemy would out do America in
science and have weapons that will blow them up. That the plot of the
film would be about two robots, GOG and MAGOG, built in a neutral
European country, but who enemy agents were able to slip into it a radio
transmitter that was not detected by American security, highlights the
American paranoia about foreigners and machines controlling the world.
Even if these machines could do a 1,000 times the work man can do, they
were also a 1,000 times deadlier than man, and this reactionary story
dwells on the negative side of what machines could do, even if the
machine in this instance is a magnificent brain.</P>
<P>Herbert Marshall, has an uninspiring role, as the man in charge of this
project, which is the installation of the first manned space station
built. This station will be sent to outer space upon its completion. The
base is under the "command" of NOVAC, an anagram for Nuclear Operated
Variable Automatic Computer. What all the fuss is about, is if American
know-how can save the world for democracy, as the project comes under
attack. Since NOVAC has been compromised by those who've reprogrammed
the computer to undermine the space-station project and have ordered
NOVAC to dispatch the two robots to kill the scientists and the project
itself, its now up to Dr. Sheppard to stop those robots.</P>
<P>The action in the film, which is none too thrilling, is in watching how
many of the 150 workers will get killed and what novel ways are the
killings to be done. There will also be some action scenes involving the
ruggedly handsome B- actor and former school teacher, Richard Egan,
putting a flame thrower to the robot, which will enable America to
launch its space station uninterrupted.</P>
<P>If the film was funny or its technology was more interesting, or if the
killings weren't so melodramatic, and the acting not so staid, and the
patriotic jingoism wasn't so shrill, I might have found this film
bearable. But since that wasn't the case, I found the film to be an
academic bore.</P>
