<P>     Having passed the year for which the designation "sophomoric" is
named in the mid-1980s, my perspective on a film like ROAD TRIP is bound
to be skewed. It is part of a grand tradition of leering, sniggering
comedies in which the anti-social behavior and hormone-fueled idiocy of
18-year-olds (portrayed by 25-year-olds) are celebrated for the
entertainment of 15-year-olds. But I remember a time when such tales were
sublimely crude (ANIMAL HOUSE) rather than ridiculously crude (AMERICAN
PIE), when the goal was celebrating an anarchic spirit rather than seeing
how much bodily fluid you could get away with in an R-rated film. Pushing
the envelope, Farrelly brothers-style, can be fun; stuffing the envelope
to the point that it requires hundreds of dollars in postage can become a
simple, wearying exercise in "can we get away with this?"</P>
<P>     If you belong to that demographic that finds a joke most appealing
when it's accompanied by a groan of disgust, have we got a treat for
you. ROAD TRIP is framed as a tale of infamy told by a campus tour guide
named Barry (Tom Green) at the fictional University of Ithaca. He tells of
Josh Parker (Breckin Meyer), an earnest enough fellow in a long-distance
relationship with a childhood sweetheart attending college in Austin,
Texas. When Josh hooks up one night with Beth (Amy Smart) and videotapes
their tryst, he thinks it's a momentary lapse ... until he discovers that
one of his roommates has mailed the tape to his girlfriend Tiffany. Soon
Josh and three pals -- libertine E.L. (Seann William Scott), brilliant
Rubin (Paulo Costanzo) and geeky Kyle (DJ Qualls) -- are on the road for
Austin, racing the clock to get to the tape before Tiffany returns to
school from a family funeral.</P>
<P>     I believe it should go without saying that the quartet takes a few
detours before reaching Texas. Most of those detours involve the Sacred
Duo of Collegiate Intemperance: mood-altering substances and sex. There's
a stop to make deposits at a sperm bank when they run out of money.
There's a stop at a college where they end up partying with members of a
black fraternity, and where Kyle loses his virginity to a corpulent
woman. And there's an overnight stay with an elderly couple where the
grizzled man of the house gets stoned and hallucinates a conversation with
his dog. It's a regular cornucopia of crudeness, choreographed by director
Todd Phillips with all the voyeuristic vigor he demonstrated when
choreographing (allegedly) the outrageous antics in the staged (allegedly) 
"documentary" FRAT HOUSE.</P>
<P>     Only it's just not all that funny. Unlike the pointlessly
message-mongering AMERICAN PIE, ROAD TRIP never pretends to be anything
more than a cesspool of moral depravity. It's even refreshing in a twisted
way that the girl who seduces Josh -- inspiring the cross-country recovery
mission in the first place -- actually becomes the film's heroine, daring
to suggest that sexually aggressive women can also be nice people. But
ROAD TRIP's singularity of purpose doesn't translate into much manic
energy. Its low-brow set pieces are pitched at obvious incongruities: 
the pairing of rail-thin Kyle with his substantial ladyfriend, an old man
sporting an obvious erection, the macho E.L. delighting in a prostate
massage. There's not much of a sense of comic discovery to ROAD TRIP's
gags; they're the gags teenagers are expected to laugh at.</P>
<P>     Deserved kudos do go to Tom Green, the MTV variety show
host-cum-circus geek who plays the demented Barry. Green's act can be
off-putting, but he's surprisingly funny as the perpetual undergrad with
an unhealthy obsession with Rubin's pet python ("unleash the fury" has
already become part of my film-based lexicon). His scenes are some of the
only moments in ROAD TRIP where you can't be sure exactly what's going to
happen next. The rest of this trip meanders through some extremely
familiar countryside, and not familiar in a way that inspires fond
comparisons to classic genre cousins. ROAD TRIP is comedy a level removed
from anything that could be really funny, because it's all about how funny
the mere idea of a profane, stoned dog could be. As the real classics of
sophomoric humor have proved over the years, even when it comes to
gross-outs, execution is everything.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 road squalors:  4.</PRE>
