<PRE>            BREATHING LESSONS: THE LIFE AND WORK OF MARK O'BRIEN
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes

<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<PRE>            "Everybody becomes disabled unless they die first."
                                       - Mark O'Brien</PRE>
<P>     Jessica Yu won the 1996 Academy Award for her documentary short
BREATHING LESSONS: THE LIFE AND WORK OF MARK O'BRIEN.  She was in town
recently to screen this film as well as two others.  (She brought her
Oscar with her -- serial number 2850 -- and generously let everyone
have a chance to hold it.  Holding that Oscar, plus the time President
Clinton shook my hand, will be among those small events of my life that
I will never forget.)</P>
<P>     If you have never heard of the poet, journalist, and remarkable
human being called Mark O'Brien, you are not usual.  Although a figure
known on the Berkeley campus as a man of courage and insight, he is not
famous even if he is one of only 119 people still alive who must live
in an iron lung.</P>
<P>     Yu was at the Telluride film festival showing her whimsical short
called SOUR DEATH BALLS when the head of the Pacific News Service, for
whom Mark works, approached her with the idea of making a documentary
on Mark's life.  Yu said she was pleased that they had the faith that
she could make serious films as well.</P>
<P>     BREATHING LESSONS works both because of Yu's artistic decisions on
how to approach the project and because of O'Brien's articulateness and
his open honesty.  He wanted to discuss subjects that most people might
shy away from in his condition.  (He has partial control of his head,
but little else.)  He discusses everything from God (he is very
religious) to sex (he wants it so bad he even paid a "sex surrogate" in
1987).</P>
<P>     O'Brien calls his iron lung, "a huge and ugly machine," which it
certainly is.  With few living polio patients left requiring iron
lungs, the medical industry has little incentive to devise something
more efficacious than this hideous looking piece of 1950's technology.</P>
<P>     (The film hit home for me.  O'Brien was born in 1949, only 3 years
after I was.  I still remember being kept inside during the summer
months.  The belief was that the virus was airborne, and the warm
weather was when it was most likely to strike.  People at the time did
not know whether this theory was valid or pure quackery, but without a
serum to prevent the disease, parents tried whatever they could.  Polio
struck intense fear into every parent's heart in the early 50's.)</P>
<P>     Yu managed to find many old photos and clips of O'Brien and his
family.  He was close to his parents, and they saved his life.  They
made the crucial decision to keep him at home rather than packing him
off to a nursing home, where polio patients then lived, on average,
only 18 months.  Later in his life, he did spend two years in a nursing
home, which scared him badly.  Today he lives in his own apartment
where he can and does fire his attendants if they prove incompetent.
His points out that it costs the government $1,800 a month at home and
$5,000 if they institutionalize him so that both parties are getting a
good deal by his being in his own place.</P>
<P>     While getting his undergraduate degree at Berkeley, O'Brien
traveled around campus on a movable bed that he controlled with his
mouth.  Old footage of this adds extra poignancy and immediacy to the
picture.</P>
<P>     Like the 1992 documentary, A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME, on physicist
Stephen Hawking, BREATHING LESSONS comes alive as O'Brien talks about
his theories.  O'Brien's thoughts are more down to earth than Hawking's
but nevertheless intriguing.  Yu manages to know how to ask just the
right questions to draw him out and has an excellent sense of how to
collect her material into a compelling whole.</P>
<P>     After the screening I got a chance to talk with Yu, and she told
me that O'Brien has had the most wonderful thing happen to him.  He has
his first girlfriend, and he is happier than she has ever seen him.</P>
<P>     Yu said that she is working now on the possibility of turning
O'Brien's story into a full length drama and has a studio interested.
The most recent work of hers to get wide distribution is an hour long
documentary on Civil War reenactors.  PBS picked it up, and the local
stations have been showing it, with each station presenting it on a
different date.</P>
<P>     Finally, if you saw the Academy Awards, you will remember her from
her acceptance speech where she mused her dress cost more than her
film.  (She points out that the Academy has a room full of designer
gowns and precious jewels for the women to wear.  But, like Cinderella,
you have to bring them back the next morning.)  So was her joke true?
Almost.  She said that her movie cost a little more than her gown, but
less than just one of her earrings.</P>
<P>     BREATHING LESSONS runs a little under 40 minutes.  The film is
subtitled in English since about 10 percent of O'Brien's speech can be
difficult to understand.  The film is not rated but might be PG-13 for
the discussion of sex.  It would be fine for kids say nine or ten and
up to see.  I recommend it to you and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
