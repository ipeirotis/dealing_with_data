<P>"There is fear in the land. And fear in the         hearts of all who 
live there. And fear puts an end to understanding and the need 
to understand. So how shall we fashion such a land when there 
is fear in the heart? The white man will put more locks on his 
door and get a fine fierce dog, but the beauty of the trees 
and of the stars, these things we shall forego.</P>
<P>"Cry, the beloved country, for the unborn child that is the 
inheritor of our fear. Let him not love the earth too deeply. 
Let him not be too moved when the birds of his land are 
singing, nor give too much of his heart to a mountain or a 
valley. For fear will rob him of all if his gives too much. 
Yes cry, cry, the
beloved country."</P>
<PRE>Change a word or two and this text can  apply today to several 
countries. </PRE>
<P>Even for people familiar with world literature, their first 
acquaintance with a South African novel was "Cry, the Beloved 
Country," by  Alan Paton (1903-1988), a white who had been 
principal of the Diepkloof Reformatory since 1935.  </P>
<P>The film (released in 1995) has adapted the beautiful, sad, 
poetic book with  maximum fidelity, including descriptions, 
dialogue and voice-over narration. It relates events in 1946. 
Stephen Kumalo, a Zulu pastor (James Earl Jones), leaves his 
rural area for his first trip to Johannesburg. With the sum 
total od his money, a paltry 14 pounds 6, and with dogged 
determination, he is looking for his sister and for his son.  
"My son, Absalom" echoes both the Bible and William Faulkner.</P>
<P>He finds the woman. She had become a prostitute of the saddest 
sort -- not from greed but by necessity.  He rescues her and 
her child. Then he eventually locates Absalom -- in prison.  
The young man had fallen in bad company and had a penal 
record. During an attempted burglary, with two companions, 
Absalom, panicking when the white occupant returned, shot him 
fatally. </P>
<P>By coincidence, the victim, Arthur, was the only child of a 
landowner from Kumalo's area, James Jarvis (Richard Harris).  
There is no doubt that Absalom, as he stated to his father and 
the Court, fired unthinkingly because he was frightened. While 
no excuse in the eyes of the law, this is  a terrible 
indictment of a society of separate and unequal races, where, 
in the dominated group, "Fear Eats the Soul," to quote the 
title of a Fassbinder film.</P>
<P>Ironically, Arthur was a liberal and the creator of a black 
center (the Claremont Boys Club). Says a club official to 
James: "He gave us all of this,"  and adds: " He is the only 
man, black or white, to see me as I am."</P>
<P>Among Arthur's writings, James  reads: "It is not native crime 
which is the problem, but white crime..." James, not shown as 
a bigot, is, like so many others, guilty by ommission and 
ignorance. He learns from tragedy. During a sleepless night, 
he tells his wife: " There was something Arthur wrote, that 
day that he... He said we taught him nothing. He means that we 
taught him nothing about the country in which he lived. He 
said that we called ourselves Christians, but we were 
indifferent to the suffering of Christians. He said that  when 
we say we are Christians, what we mean is that we are 
white.... Oh, why... Why, why, why, why do we bring children 
into this world?" </P>
<P>In ways too delicate and complex to detail or reveal here, the 
two distraught fathers meet. Jarvis, unaware of who the 
anonymous visitor is ( Kumalo almost collapses from emotion), 
treats him kindly. Then the preacher, with immense pain 
declares: "It was my son that killed your son." Jarvis, still 
gentle: "I understand what I did not understand.  There is no 
anger in me." They part with "Go well, umfundisi" (a 
respectful expression for "pastor")  and "Stay well umnumzana" 
("sir"). The sequence is heartbreaking, the actors superb, 
both tens on a scale of 1 to 10. </P>
<P>James Earl Jones has an enormous presence, all the stronger 
for his contained agony. Richard Harris, in  his most 
underplayed, quiet role ever, is also a paragon of moving, 
unrhetorical, unshowy reactions.  The strange but believable 
bond between the two men is reinforced in the scenes that 
follow.  </P>
<P>I confess that I was a bit worried at the start of the movie, 
first because the music by James Barry sounded like a clone of 
his score for "Out of Africa," secondly because the trek of 
the Rev. Kumalo to Johannesburg, where he gets scammed and 
robbed on arrival, might overdevelop the aspect of a rube in a 
big city. But neither musical nor plot cliches appear. 
Instead, we get a series of events that go from touching to 
moving to devastating, both for the characters and the 
audience. The poignancy is cumulative, impossible to resist. 
It lasts to the very end when the preacher goes up to the 
mountain, with more Biblical echoes, not to mention Martin 
Luther King.</P>
<P>There is true emotion, dignity and nobility in this film, yet 
none that you might suspect of pulling out all the stops in 
order to influence the audience.  There is also, in the eyes 
of many critics, a great deal of true Christianity, but in my 
opinion the story transcends Christianity, Judaism, ancestor 
worship or totemism, reaching instead deep levels of humanity 
that cut across religions or non-faiths. </P>
<P>Not everything is obvious. Neither the police nor the 
prosecutor or the judge are made into racist villains. During 
Absalom's trial, whenever Arthur Jarvis  is mentioned, it is 
not by name, but as "the white man." This speaks volumes. So 
does the richness of the film in major elements ( like the 
kindness and help shown Kumalo by a white Bishop and a black, 
complex clergyman), small touches (impasses for blacks, the 
hostility of the bordello's madam), integrated incidentals (a 
bus boycott that forces the two preachers to walk 11 miles), 
and much else. </P>
<P>By Hollywood standards, this is an Un-American movie, I mean 
one that takes its time with feelings, reflections and 
reactions. Yet slow it isn't.  The running time is listed 
variously as 108 and as 120 minutes. It is quite possible that 
after its initial screening the film was cut, but even in that 
case, no harm was done. It still plays like a Greek tragedy 
for our time. Not to be missed. </P>
