<P>     Saying that TIN CUP may be the best-ever "golf motion picture" 
isn't exactly high praise, considering the competition (CADDYSHACK, 
HAPPY GILMORE), but it's true nonetheless.  In fact, as sports movies go 
(regardless of the sport), this one turns in a respectable showing, 
injecting some intelligence and maturity into a story that easily could 
have succumbed to a flood of "struggling underdog" cliches.  That's not 
to say that elements of the formula aren't here, but they rarely 
threaten to overwhelm TIN CUP's better aspects.</P>
<P>     When it comes to making sports movies, no one has shown more 
aptitude than Ron Shelton, whose writing and directing credits include 
films about baseball (BULL DURHAM, COBB), basketball (BLUE CHIPS, WHITE 
MEN CAN'T JUMP), football (THE BEST OF TIMES), boxing (THE GREAT WHITE 
HYPE), and now golf.  Shelton has structured TIN CUP a little like BULL 
DURHAM, interweaving an adult romance with the story of a man struggling 
to find self-respect through the sport he loves.  However, while 
romantic subplots are frequently used as side dishes for motion picture 
athletic contests, Shelton keeps the two disparate elements of his movie 
on equal footing, which lends a sense of balance to the finished 
product.</P>
<P>     One of the most laudable characteristics of TIN CUP is that the 
script never condescends to either of the main characters.  These aren't 
two mismatched caricatures engaging in a series of familiar romantic 
moves.  Crisp, thoughtful dialogue replaces the empty banter we've 
become accustomed to in screen love stories.  There's a believability 
and depth to both Kevin Costner's Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy and Rene Russo's 
Molly Griswold, and the understated manner in which they relate to each 
other is a welcome change-of-pace during this season of loud, 
ostentatious explosions.  And, while the chemistry between Costner and 
Russo doesn't sizzle, they work together in a comfortable, relaxed 
manner.  As Roy puts it, they fit like a pair of old shoes.</P>
<P>     The story centers around the title character, an aging club pro who 
lives in a Winnebago in the lonely west Texas town of Salome.  He spends 
his day in the company of his best friend, Romeo (Cheech Marin), working 
for $7 an hour at a deserted driving range.  Once upon a time, Roy had a 
bright golfing future ahead of him, but he blew his cool on the links, 
went for the trick shot instead of the smart one, and failed to qualify 
for the tour.  Since then, he has been hiding out in obscurity, picking 
up cash where he can, and watching bitterly as his old college partner, 
Dave Simms (Don Johnson), "a rich, happy, soulless" man, rises through 
the PGA ranks.  </P>
<P>     One day, Roy's marginal existence is turned upside down by the 
arrival of a woman psychologist named Molly Griswold.  She wants to take 
golf lessons to impress her boyfriend.  To the men of Salome, the 
concept of a female doctor is a revelation, and, in one of the film's 
more slyly amusing scenes, they watch eagerly as Roy teaches her the 
basics of hitting a golf ball, wondering how "such a pretty girl can 
have such an ugly swing."  It doesn't take long for Roy to fall in love 
with Molly, so it comes as a blow when she reveals that her boyfriend is 
none other than Dave Simms.  Roy then decides that a grand gesture is 
needed to win her -- something like qualifying for the U.S. Open and 
beating Dave in front of a national TV audience.</P>
<P>     Although this may sound like a very familiar, traditional sports 
movie, don't worry -- Shelton applies enough tweaks and twists to the 
formulaic story to keep us interested and a little unsure of the 
outcome.  The experience is akin to following a often-traveled road then 
suddenly taking a detour onto a parallel, but nevertheless different, 
course. TIN CUP isn't concerned with blazing new trails -- that's beyond 
its scope or ambition.  Instead, it's content to offer a pleasantly 
likable, gently comic two hours of simple life lessons, with golf as the 
obvious metaphor.</P>
<P>     As the saying goes, you don't have to appreciate the sport to enjoy 
the movie.  Undoubtedly, however, the film makers are hoping that the 
burgeoning popularity of golf will help at the box office.  This is the 
first such movie to boast cameos by top-notch players, including Corey 
Pavin, Fred Couples, and Lee Janzen.  Still, TIN CUP has a broad enough 
appeal that intimate knowledge of the joys and frustrations of playing 
18 holes isn't necessary.  This movie ranks as better-than-par 
entertainment.</P>
