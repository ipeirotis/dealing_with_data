<PRE>FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS</PRE>
<P>Starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro</P>
<P>Written by Alex Cox, Tod Davies, Terry Gilliam and Tony Grisoni</P>
<PRE>Directed by Terry Gilliam</PRE>
<P>I've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid. Dropping acid is like 
riding a roller coaster blindfolded; you have no idea where the peaks 
and valleys are, no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your 
stomach into your throat, and no idea how long the ride will last. Then 
there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come 
with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose. Mushrooms, on the other hand, 
offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a Ferris wheel: 
a steady, reassuring assent, a short period of thrilling motion and 
color, and then a smooth landing. Acid is for daredevils; mushrooms are 
for refined seekers of joy.</P>
<P>My point is that in FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, director Terry 
Gilliam has made an acid movie, when I wish he would have made a 
mushroom movie. Full of shocking sight gags, aggressive images and 
grotesque comic performances, the film certainly offers something for 
those fans of Hunter S. Thompson's book who want to experience its 
twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out. But for those of 
us who just want to enjoy a well-made film, Gilliam has produced a mixed 
bag.</P>
<P>FEAR AND LOATHING tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed 
"gonzo" journalist Hunter S. Thompson (Johnny Depp) and Hispanic 
activist attorney Oscar Zeta Actosta (Benicio Del Toro), came to Las 
Vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the 
middle of a District Attorney's convention while ingesting every 
conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971. Operating under 
the pseudonyms of "Raoul Duke" and "Dr. Gonzo", the two men careen into 
Vegas on an acid and mescaline bender, then hole up in a hotel suite to 
binge on amyl nitrite, cocaine, tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored 
uppers and downers. They terrorize every one they meet, mostly because 
every one they meet terrifies them. Duke hallucinates giant bats on the 
way into town, then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino 
lounge. Dr. Gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and 
begs Duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as 
Jefferson Airplane's "White Rabbit" reaches its climax. And these guys 
don't just trash hotel rooms - they rape them, humiliate them and 
leave them for dead. That neither of them ends up dead or in jail is 
testament to blind luck or Providence, depending on your point of view.</P>
<P>Thompson's book, besides being a hilarious read, has stood the test of 
time as an important historical document. It simultaneously exposed the 
60's drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed Las Vegas as 
the place where the American Dream came to die. Pontificate all you want 
about how the film illustrates Thompson's message, but the truth is 
that, stripped to its bare essentials, what Gilliam has wrought is a 
drug comedy. It's a Cheech and Chong movie. You're there to watch 
Depp and del Toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the 
results: see Johnny take drugs, see Johnny fall down.</P>
<P>There's nothing wrong with this concept, but Gilliam tries too hard. 
This is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups, wide-angle lenses, 
Dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes. There are times when 
Gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on 
the screen. But to what end? Much of the dialogue comes verbatim from 
Thompson's book, and there are some priceless comic observations. But 
you're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled 
camera work. This brings us to the performances, which strike me as all 
wrong. Depp plays Thompson as Groucho Marks filtered through George C. 
Scott in PATTON - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting 
satire of Thompson's dialogue. In between his several puking scenes, 
Del Toro fares better as Dr. Gonzo, but he also mumbles and sputters so 
many of his lines that their weight is lost. Watching these two made me 
wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago, with Dan Akroyd and 
John Belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see.</P>
<P>It's interesting to note that Alex Cox, credited as a co-writer on the 
screenplay, was originally slated to direct before Gilliam took over. As 
much of a fan as I am of Gilliam's work, Cox would have been the 
better choice. SID AND NANCY, Cox's best work, covered essentially the 
same subject matter, but Cox was able to pull back and allow the 
characters of Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen to carry the film. Gilliam 
commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being 
uncertain of his purpose. What kind of movie was he trying to make, 
anyway? It doesn't try to be a cautionary tale, and it doesn't work 
as broad comedy. If he had considered more carefully his purpose, the 
result would have been a much more interesting film. But I don't want 
to be too hard on it. There are some truly funny moments, and if 
you're in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it. I do, 
however, recommend watching FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS under the 
influence of your favorite controlled substance - I guarantee it will 
enhance the effect.</P>
