<P>THE PIED PIPER  (director: Jacques Demy; cast: Donald Pleasence (The
Baron), John Hurt (Franz), Jack Wild (Gavin), Donovan (Pied Piper),
Cathyrn Harrison (Lisa), Michael Hordern (Melius), Peter Vaughan
(Bishop), Keith Buckley (Mattio), Roy Kinnear (Burgermeister), 1972-GB)</P>
<P>This version of THE PIED PIPER is not exactly told as a children's
fable, retelling the Robert Browning poem of the piper (Donovan) who
rids Hamelin of its rats, as this English speaking film placed in the
able hands of the French director, Jacques Demy, reveals a gripping
story of evil in the Middle-Ages, a time when 75 million people across
Europe died of the plague, as he tells of the corrupted church and local
town administrators, working in cahoots, as their maniacal plans
coincide to support a papal war in Italy and for the town to build a
huge cathedral for itself, all this in the midst of the bubonic plague
of 1349, which the church interpreted as part of God's master plan.</P>
<P>We are in Northern Germany and a caravan of Gypsy performers, led by
Mattio (Keith), stops to pick up a musician (Donovan), as they try to
reach Hamelin for the wedding celebration between the lordly Franz
(Hurt) and Lisa (Cathyrn), the wealthy burgermeister's fourteen year old
daughter, but are refused entry to the city because of fear that they
might be carriers of the plague. In the hamlet, Lisa is in a coma. A
delegation of clergy is there to give her the last rites, but the
burgermeister summons, as a last resort, the aid of the town's outcast,
the Jewish alchemist, Melius (Hordern), who states the girl is not going
to die, she doesn't have the plague, but needs rest and music. The
church delegates leave in a huff, accusing the Jew of causing the plague
and dabbling in work that goes against God's will. Soon a piper's
soothing music, coming from outside the gates of the hamlet is heard, as
it revives the young girl, encouraging the burgermeister to summon the
piper, who tells the messengers sent to retrieve him, that he will not
enter unless his Gypsy friends can also enter the hamlet.</P>
<P>Gavin (Wild) is the crippled helper of Melius, idolizing him, looking to
him for paternal advise and wisdom. He is in love with Lisa, who is a
few years younger than he is, but is helpless to stop the marriage of
the very evil, self-serving Franz, who appears to be a man in his 30s,
who does not love Lisa, but insists on the marriage as a means of
getting a dowry from her family, money that his family dearly needs.
Lisa is just a little girl, who doesn't seem capable of loving anyone,
at this point of her life.</P>
<P>The baron is evilly played by Donald Pleasence, who has taxed his
subjects to the limit and now must devise ways to get more money for his
fiefdom. Franz devises a plan for the pope to have his soldiers for war,
by forcing the alchemist to come up with gilded gold, which the baron
will use to give to the hamlet's teenagers, so that they will be enticed
into joining the pope's army in Italy, while their fathers stay home to
build the baron's cathedral. Thereby, the pope, having gotten the
soldier's from town, will supply the rest of the money needed to finish
the cathedral.</P>
<P>At the wedding celebration, the rats are present everywhere, scaring the
town to death. The piper offers to get rid of the rats, if the
burgermeister gives him 1,000 guildas. When the piper plays his tune,
and the rats all march out of the town and are drowned in the river, the
burgermeister, foolishly and greedily thinking that the crisis from the
rats causing the black plague is over, reneges on his promise to the
piper. As a result, the piper plays his tune, and all the children,
including Lisa, leave with the piper, disappearing with him to wherever
he is leading them to. The only one who can't make it, is the crippled
Gavin, who leaves town with the Gypsyies, since his mentor was burnt at
the stake by the church inquisitors.</P>
<P>This version of Browning's poem is well-told and sensible, and probably
a lot like he meant it to be conveyed, but somehow it looks flat on
screen, like it was a B movie, and this is surprising, since Demy is
really a great director. But, evidently, something went terribly wrong
here. The film is so flatly done, it was as if I was watching the
machine-like actors go through the motions of acting out a chilling
story, that when it came out on screen had lost its chills, even if the
story itself remained chilling.</P>
