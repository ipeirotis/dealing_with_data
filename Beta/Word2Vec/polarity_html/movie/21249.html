<P>     BODY SHOTS opens with a profound quote attributed to 
"anonymous": "I'll give you a ride/On my jelly roll/But I won't give you
nothin'/From my soul."  That's about as succinct a summation as any for
this lugubrious, pretentious exercise in Gen Y navel-gazing that follows
eight single young Los Angelenos through a club-hopping Friday night and a
what-the-hell-happened Saturday morning.  Four guy pals -- Rick (Sean
Patrick Flanery), Mike (Jerry O'Connell), Shawn (Brad Rowe) and Trent (Ron
Livingston) -- meet up with four gal pals -- Jane (Amanda Peet), Sara
(Tara Reid), Whitney (Emily Procter) and Emma (Sybil Temchen) -- at a hot
nightspot, and begin pairing off in various combinations.  Accompanying
their dalliances are running talk-to-the-screen commentaries by the
characters on contemporary love and sex that make the "Confessional"
segments on "The Real World" look like revelations of zen wisdom.</P>
<P>     Those pseudo-profound asides -- spending long stretches on subjects
like oral sex technique under the winking guise of "telling it like it is" 
-- are plenty bad enough to make BODY SHOTS an irritating experience. It
becomes positively headache-inducing when director Michael Cristofer
starts dragging out each and every scene for all the slow-motion,
lingering pause significance it's worth.  Characters spin in blissful
kisses on the dance floor for minutes at a time, serenaded by the droning
observations of their friends; interminable silences are punctuated by
someone else's equally interminable silence.  It's one thing to make a
movie about life's painfully uncomfortable moments.  It's another to make
that movie panifully uncomfortable for the people watching it.</P>
<P>     Things go from very bad to even worse in the final half hour, which
is dedicated almost exclusively to a he-said/she-said date rape scenario
involving testosterone-beast professional football player Mike (who
apparently didn't get the memo that the Raiders had moved back to
Oakland) and the flirtatious Sara.  The jerky flashbacks show wildly
different versions of the same event, as Cristofer strains to give the 
tale RASHOMON-like credibility.  Then, strangely, the incident becomes
less about exploring lack of communication between sexual partners than
about lecturing on the treacherous combination of alcohol and raging
libidos; you half-expect someone to step out of character and tell you
where you can find literature on helping friends avoid binge 
beer-goggling.  Both Mike and Sara get to stare at the floor pensively as
they try to figure out exactly what they really remember, every passing
second of the violent rape Sara recounts feeling more exploitative because
there's no reason for us to care about the people involved.</P>
<P>     The reason there's no particular reason for us to care is that these
characters aren't really people.  The ad campaign for BODY SHOTS touts it
as one of those "movies that define every decade," but screenwriter David
McKenna makes his decade-defining generalizations by making his characters
single-trait generic -- Shawn is sensitive, Emma is sensitive in a
slightly different way, Whitney has a vaguely Southern accent.  Only Ron
Livingston, as the crew's resident eccentric, gets enough unique
personality to make a comic impression (which he does admirably in the
film's few worthwhile scenes).  The monotonous talking-head asides provide
the only insight BODY SHOTS has to offer into its characters, and then
McKenna uses the time to blow the lid off the fact that -- gasp -- there's
a sexual double-standard between men and women.  With its marathon sex
scenes and graphically trite narration, BODY SHOTS generally feels like
porn with delusions of social commentary.  Ultimately, it's just there to
give you a ride on its jelly roll, but it won't give you nothin' from its
soul.</P>
