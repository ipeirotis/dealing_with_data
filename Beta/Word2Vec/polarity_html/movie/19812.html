Review by Chad Dowdell
** out of *****</PRE>

Written and Directed by: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez
Running Time: 87 minutes
Date Reviewed: August 3, 1999</P>
<P>***Be warned... the following review contains some harsh language***</P>
<P>The Blair Witch Project.  Quite possibly the least scariest movie of
all time.  If you want to see real terror on the big screen go back
and watch any scene with Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace, because
this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy.</P>
<P>My colleague and friend Chuck Dowling wrote that if less is more, then
the Blair Witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more.
And this worked for him.  Well, I'm sorry, but nothing... is
NOTHING!!!!!  NOTHING IS NOT MORE.  IT'S NOTHIIIIIINGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!.</P>
<P>I do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing.  "Nothing" is free, available
all around the world at a location near you.</P>
<P>I am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary.
I could just discount them and say, "Well, I guess they are just pansy
chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow."  But I
have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn't hold
water.  There must be some other reason.  (Then again, maybe my first
thought is correct, I think I'll try pointing their shadow out to them
one day and test their reaction.)</P>
<P>When I hear people praising this film, I never hear them talking about
what makes up about 97% of this movie: three kids bickering with each
other about being lost.  They only talk about what might make up
possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time.  This being a few very short
night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where
they shout "Josh!!"  over and over.  This film should not be called
The Blair Witch Project, it should more accurately be called THREE
DUMB AND PISSPOOR FILMMAKERS GET LOST...  AND ARGUE WITH EACH OTHER.</P>
<P>Oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them
shouting "Josh!!".  And if you thought that was scary, wait till you
see a pile of rocks, and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs, oh my dear
lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear.  Oh yeah, and some
goo on one of their backpacks.  You've never seen terror like this
folks, and you don't want to.  The Chevy Chase/Goldie Hawn comedy Foul
Play is creepier than this film.  (For current films, I highly
recommend The Sixth Sense or A Stir of Echoes for a creepy filmgoing
experience.)</P>
<P>This film is an example of marketing with no substance.  The marketing
was brilliant, and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for
the film.  They want this film to be good.  And I think they are
reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don't have anything
else to praise.  That wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre
may come along, but this is not it.  This film could have been SO much
better.  Just think, if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of
arguing about being lost, and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff.</P>
<P>I saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it.  She was
sold on this film.  And then, at one point during it, she turned to me
and asked '...are we supposed to be scared by this?'.</P>
<P>I've heard one opinion that you "have to use your imagination" to
create the fear in this movie.  Well, I thought that was what the
filmmakers were supposed to do.  Use THEIR imagination and create a
good movie.  I mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5
bucks for it.  But even if you like this idea, then what are you
imagining?  An entity called the blair witch?  Some rednecks fucking
with these kids?  Are either of these things really scary when you
think about it???</P>
<P>I've heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how
scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something.  Well sure
thats scary in real life, but there are a lot of things that are scary
in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting.  You
could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be
scary, but in a film it wouldn't be.</P>
<P>And no, a movie does not need a big budget or CGI special effects to
be scary or creepy.  Actually the less the better (see the equally
awful remake of The Haunting).  But you have to do SOMETHING.  You
cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something
like this COULD BE SCARY, if it were real.  And by the way, about the
shakycam filming in Blair Witch.  Aren't these supposed to be
"filmmakers" who should know how to point a camera and shoot something
without shaking the camera constantly?  I'm not even talking about the
couple scenes where they are terrified, that's justified.  I'm talking
about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can't seem to shoot
anything smoothly at all.  Minor quibble there.</P>
<P>There is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are
suckers.  That the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all
the way to the bank.  And I think there is a good chance they will see
this film again and say to themselves "what was I thinking??".  But,
if they don't, then thats fine.  If it works for them then that's okay
I guess.  I just lament that by making this movie a hit, we are going
to be subjected to more of the "nothing is more" approach.  Pretty
soon we're going to get some movies like this: just a still shot of a
prison jail cell.  For 90 minutes.  And we'll have to use our
imagination and think to ourselves, "my god, wouldn't it be scary to
spend life in prison?!!  This movie is the scariest movie of all
time!!!!!".  Or, a shot of a coffin, with some funeral directors
arguing with each other.  "Man, do you know how scary it would be to
die???!!!!  Now THIS is the scariest movie of all time!!!!" [R]</P>
