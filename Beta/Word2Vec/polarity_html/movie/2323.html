                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Ann-Margret, Kevin Pollak,
           Daryl Hannah, Ossie Davis, Burgess Meredith.
Screenplay:  Mark Steven Johnson.
Director:  Donald Petrie.</P>
<P>     In a sense, there's really not all that much to say about a movie
like GRUMPY OLD MEN.  It's the kind of movie one generally describes
with somewhat faint-praise adjectives like "cute," or "fun," or
"entertaining."  GRUMPY OLD MEN is all of these things, to a point.
There are a couple of belly laughs, but there's not much genuine
spark.  For all its manufactured whimsy, GRUMPY OLD MEN is basically a
sit-com, a moderately diverting 105-minute episode of "The Golden
Boys."</P>
<P>     The GRUMPY OLD MEN of the title are John Gustafson (Jack Lemmon)
and Max Goldman (Walter Matthau), 50-year acquaintances and next-door
neighbors in Wabasha, MN who carry on a long-standing feud.  John
throws fish into Max's back seat; Max changes John's television
channels with his remote control.  However, their bickering takes a
turn for the even worse when Ariel Truax (Ann-Margret) moves in across
the street.  The beautiful and spirited Airel attracts the attention of
both men, but neither is brave enough to make the first move.  So when
Ariel makes the first move--for both of them--old animosities are
stirred to the boiling point.</P>
<P>     GRUMPY OLD MEN opens with a great deal of promise.  For one thing,
it's simply a pleasure to see Lemmon and Matthau together again.  They
have little trouble creating the impression that their characters have
known each other for years, slipping easily into the good-natured
antagonism that fueled THE ODD COUPLE, THE FRONT PAGE and BUDDY BUDDY.
Matthau is particularly fun to watch, an ear-flapped hunting cap
comically framing his basset hound face.  The trouble is that they're
not given all that much to do besides call each other "moron" and
"putz."  There are a few nice bits of physical humor, notable Lemmon
spraying Matthau with a garden hose and Matthau taking an ax to a foot
of ice in a futile attempt to retrieve his prized ice-fishing pole.
But for the most part GRUMPY OLD MEN just strolls along, apparently
convinced that we're so comfortable with the actors that we'll find
anything they do amusing.</P>
<P>     The other characterizations in GRUMPY OLD MEN are wildly uneven.
On the plus side is Ann-Margret, who is positively luminous.  She's
perfect for the role of Ariel, radiating a joie de vivre which would
clearly be appealing to the two icy septugenarians.  There is a
marvelous warmth to her scenes with Lemmon and Matthau, and I was sorry
that her part wasn't even larger.  Ossie Davis, as a bait shop owner
who has put up with the bickering of John and Max for decades, is also
good.  On the down side is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon's father, playing
a male version of Estelle Getty's Sophia from "The Golden Girls."  He
appears briefly for the express purpose of being cantankerous and
sexually suggestive, once again proving that it's supposed to be funny
that older people think about sex, too.  One of the script's bigger
disappointments is a tacked-on relationship between Kevin Pollak and
Daryl Hannah, playing Max's son and Lemmon's daughter respectively.
Their characters don't serve much purpose, and while both actors are
very appealing, I couldn't figure out what the point was.  The time
spent on their flirtations would have been time better spent making
John and Max fuller characters.</P>
<P>     GRUMPY OLD MEN does nothing to offend overtly.  The photography of
the snow-covered Minnesota town is bright and atmospheric, particularly
the ice-fishing village; Alan Silvestri adds a cheerful if somewhat
pedestrian score.  There are enough chuckles in the film to make it a
decent matinee diversion, but overall GRUMPY OLD MEN relies far too
much on the history between Lemmon and Matthau, and far too little on
anything particularly clever in Mark Steven Johnson's script.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 grumpy old men:  5.</PRE>
