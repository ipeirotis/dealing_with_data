<P>     Supposedly, WILD AMERICA is a family film, but I can't figure out 
which members of the family it's intended for.  Children will likely be 
bored by this adventure that doesn't really go anywhere, and adults will 
have their patience tried by the bad dialogue and juvenile plot twists.  
I could equate this with the kind of program that used to be shown on 
the old WONDERFUL WORLD OF DISNEY TV series, except I think those one 
hour shows, as plodding as they often were, offered more enjoyment.</P>
<P>     WILD AMERICA wants us to believe that it's based on a true story, 
but that's probably the biggest fiction of all.  Very little of this 
preposterous plot has the ring of truth to it.  A kernel of the real 
story likely remains, but not much more.  Even the character 
relationships seem simplified and streamlined so as not to confuse the 
audience.  And, of course, in the end, everything works out for the 
best.  The movie, directed by William Dear, who was responsible for the 
offensive remake of ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD, shows no ambition in 
bringing this tale to the screen.  Anyone under the age of about twelve 
will get the feeling that they're being condescended to.</P>
<P>     WILD AMERICA chronicles the supposed adventures of the three 
Stouffer brothers during the summer of 1967.  All of them grew up to 
become animal photographers, and this movie purports to show how it all 
started.  Armed with only a 16 mm camera, several cans of film, and the 
necessary provisions, the three boys -- Marty (Scott Bairstow), age 18; 
Mark (Devon Sawa), age 16; and Marshall (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), age 12 
-- leave their native Arkansas to make a cross-country trip to film 
endangered predators in their natural habitats.  Their goal:  "to get 
the shots everyone else is afraid to get."  In the process, they place 
themselves in great danger, yet miraculously escape alive and relatively 
uninjured.  </P>
<P>     No member of the main trio is either complex or interesting.  Marty 
(who, in real life, created the TV series WILD AMERICA) is portrayed as 
a driven artist whose hero is Ernest Hemingway.  Mark, the middle child, 
is "a man of action" who often seems more interested in girls than 
animals.  Then there's our narrator (the voiceover never seems to stop), 
Marshall, a "dreamer" whose amazing wisdom would do someone three times 
his age credit.  None of the actors creates a memorable personae.  
Bairstow and Sawa are adequate, but Taylor Thomas (from the sitcom HOME 
IMPROVEMENT) irritates with his false earnestness.  </P>
<P>     Parts of the film -- primarily those dealing with photographing 
wildlife -- are moderately engrossing, which leads me to wonder if there 
might have been an interesting story to tell here, had the film not 
ventured into the realm of half-baked melodrama.  WILD AMERICA comes 
across mostly as episodic silliness:  the boys escape from fake-looking 
alligators, go skinny-dipping with girls, stumble upon a practice range 
and dodge the firepower of Air Force planes, meet up with a spooky Danny 
Glover, then avoid a group of angry bears whose cave is guarded by 
snakes.  It's a telling statement that, hands down, the best scenes in 
the movie occur during the end credits, when we are given a chance to 
view snippets of the Stouffers' films.</P>
<P>     One wonders if there should have been some sort of "don't try this 
at home" warning attached to WILD AMERICA.  After all, the kids in the 
film seem to be having fun (certainly more fun than those of us sitting 
in the audience are having), and they're never really in danger.  Then 
again, where in real life is anyone going to find an alligator who likes 
chewing on flashlights, a belligerent rubber rattlesnake, or a bear that 
is stupid enough to hibernate in the middle of the summer?  I guess the 
only real warning that should accompany WILD AMERICA is the one about 
avoiding dogs like this movie.</P>
