<P>     I was sitting next to a Laugher as I watched GONE FISHIN'.  When I
say "Laugher," I don't just mean someone who laughs loudly, or someone who
laughs frequently.  I mean someone who laughs loudly _and_ frequently.
The most innocuous line of dialogue was greeted with a hearty chuckle,
while a full-fledged sight gag inspired the kind of explosive bellow which
I was certain would cause a loss of bladder control.  If Disney had
test-screened GONE FISHIN' for an audience comprised entirely of clones of
this fellow, the champagne corks would have been popping like bubble wrap
in the hands of a 10-year-old.</P>
<P>     Under most circumstances, the Laugher would have annoyed me to
distraction.  In the case of GONE FISHIN', the distraction was welcome.
The film's breathtaking awfulness forced my mind to wander in sheer
self-defense, leading me to spend a lot of time thinking about what a
splendid time the Laugher was having.  As a critic, it is sometimes useful
for me to confront how uniquely personal the movie-going experience can
be, particularly when it comes to comedy.  In my world, GONE FISHIN' was a
complete catastrophe.  In the Laugher's world, it was an unqualified
delight.</P>
<P>     There's certainly nothing inherently clever about the premise.  Joe
Pesci and Danny Glover play a couple of life-long pals named Joe Waters
and Gus Green, who share a love of fishing and a talent for leaving
heaping piles of rubble in their wake.  And that, ultimately, is what GONE
FISHIN' is about.  Forget the contest which sends Joe and Gus to the
Florida Everglades from their New Jersey home, forget the run-ins with a
creepy con artist (Nick Brimble) and the search for his hidden loot,
forget the cameos by Louise Fletcher and Willie Nelson (they'll certainly 
hope you do).  GONE FISHIN' is about boats crashing through plate glass
windows, exploding gas stations, exploding hotel rooms, and wild rides on
runaway vehicles of every possible kind.  In other words, it's in the
tradition of the slapstick-y live-action comedies Disney made when Dean
Jones and Kurt Russell were foiling the nefarious schemes of Joe Flynn and
Cesar Romero in various permutations.</P>
<P>     At least those concoctions were fast-paced and enthusiastically
silly.  For every two minutes of action in GONE FISHIN' there are at least
twenty minutes of inane chatter between Pesci and Glover.  The two are
supposed to be lovable, incurably optimistic simpletons, but someone
forgot to spend any script time on the "lovable" part.  Joe and Gus are
dull, immature and, worst of all, they simply refuse to shut up.  They're
like two long-lost Howard brothers, a pair of Stooges whose suburban
upbringing bred most of the malice out of them and left them garrulous,
well-intentioned accidental anarchists.</P>
<P>     Thoughts of the Three Stooges led me back to the Laugher, and his
enjoyment suddenly made a lot more sense.  He was laughing at Joe and Gus
because they were losers who managed to take con men and slick-talking
salesmen down along with them.  They were Everymen looking for a break,
but they were also trouble-makers.  The were rebels without a clue, making
an id-level connection the way the Stooges have made id-level connections
for sixty years.  It's actually a bit of an insult to the Stooges to
compare them to the ponderous shenanigans of Joe and Gus, except to note
that the audience may find the mayhem similarly appealing.  For the
Laugher, Joe and Gus's adventures were a riotous 10+.  The less
Stooge-inclined may consider them nothing but a pair of foreheads waiting
for a swinging two-by-four.  Now _that_ would be comedy.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 fish shticks:  2.</PRE>
