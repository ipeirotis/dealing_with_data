<PRE>Fright Night Part 2
A Review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Roddy McDowall; William Ragsdale; Traci Lin & Julie Carmen</P>
<P>It is with some sad irony that I screened Fright Night Part 2 on the day
that one of it's stars, Roddy McDowall passed away at the age of 70.
McDowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in Hollywood,
having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100
films. Fright Night Part 2 probably will not be counted among his more
memorable roles. This is really sad considering how good the first Fright
Night film was. William Ragsdale and Roddy McDowall both reprised their
roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones
that realize that vampires walk among us. (At least in the movies anyway.)
It has been several years since Charlie Brewster (Ragsdale) and B-movie
actor turned late night horror film host, Peter Vincent (McDowall) came face
to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be Charlie's next door
neighbor. Charlie and Peter won that battle, but apparently even vampires
have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family.
Apparently Charlie's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who
was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her
sibling. So she decides to exact a little bit of revenge. This ends up
forcing Charlie and Peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again.</P>
<P>One of the things that made Fright Night such a success was Chris Sarandon
who played Charlie's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood.
Fright Night Part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort.
While they are stylish, the vamps in this film just don't have the
personality of the undead in the first film. With the exception of a
werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes. One
bright spot, speaking from a strictly sexist point of view, is Traci Lin,
who plays Charlie's very skeptical girlfriend. It's really a shame that her
career hasn't been better since she made this film. Ragsdale does a fair job
in this film, but doesn't give nearly the performance that he did in the
original. Roddy McDowall makes the most with what he is given, which
unfortunately isn't much which is a shame because his character was a lot of
fun in the original movie.</P>
<P>I guess I would have to say that the first film was a superior product in
every way. The original always left you feeling danger was lurking right
around the corner, Part 2 had more of the feel of a music video. Never a
good thing for a horror film. Another minus for Part 2 was the traditional
scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for
something to jump out of a shadow where very rare. For that matter, they
were almost nonexistent.</P>
<P>If I was going to watch a horror film, this would be far from my first
choice. The first Fright Night, on the other hand, would be right up near
the top of my list. If I was in the mood for a Roddy McDowall film I'd
probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and
rent Planet Of The Apes. Either way Fright Night Part 2 would most likely
not enter into the equation.</P>
