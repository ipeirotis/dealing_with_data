<PRE>SCARY MOVIE 2 * * * </PRE>
<P>2001 - USA 
Director: Keenen Ivory Wayans 
Starring: Anna Faris, Christopher Masterson, Tim Curry, Marlon Wayans, Regina 
Hall, Shawn Wayans, Kathleen Robertson, James Woods, Chris Elliott, Tori 
Spelling, David Cross </P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Frankie Paiva </PRE>
<P>The original Scary Movie was released under the radar last year and astounded 
analysts and its studio, Dimension Films, with its high box office gross. The 
film spoofed classic horror films using `Scream' as an outline, with plenty 
of disgusting and raw scatological humor. Scary Movie placed number three on 
my worst five films of the year list for 2000, but since the film earned $157 
million domestically, and because life is unfair, a sequel was inevitable. </P>
<P>The surprise is that it really isn't that bad. The sequel is far more clever 
than the first, this time adding political references and current events into 
the mix. There's a nice balance between Firestone tire and Nike TV ad jokes, 
and a clown being choked to death by a phallus jokes. The film is fun 
overkill. </P>
<P>Anna Faris (who, in a bizarre side note, was born and raised in the small 
Seattle suburb of Edmonds, Washington where this author resides) reprises the 
role of Cindy Campbell. Her horny psychology professor (Tim Curry, who else?) 
stages some type of psychological experiment for her and all her friends from 
the original Scary Movie, who all happen to go to the same college. The 
experiment involves spending the weekend in a haunted mansion. Things, of 
course, go terribly and hilariously wrong. </P>
<P>Not that the plot really matters. The film moves from one joke to another so 
quickly it's really a string of punch lines rather than a story. This is 
forgivable because the material is very funny... but there's a problem. </P>
<P>If you haven't kept up on popular culture lately, you're likely to miss many 
of the jokes. A very clever spoof of Save the Last Dance flew by even the 
teenagers at my packed screening, as did a Rocky send-up. Other films are so 
cleverly woven into the plot that one viewing isn't nearly enough to spot 
them all. Less obvious jokes spoof films like The Game, The Amityville Horror 
, Urban Legend, and Hollow Man. All that and a character named Jamie Lee 
Curtisto. </P>
<P>One of the biggest problems with Scary Movie was that it had to adhere so 
closely to the storyline of Scream. Scary Movie 2 is a combination of House 
on Haunted Hill and The Haunting, but even that's a loose structure. </P>
<P>This gives the actors time to roam around, and the result is a more relaxed 
pace. Regina Hall gives a funny performance that goes against the premise 
that African-Americans always die first in horror movies. Christopher 
Masterson and Faris have good chemistry, but the film really belongs to Chris 
Elliott. As Hanson, the house's caretaker with a deformed, odd-looking left 
hand, and less than appealing facial features, he is completely wonderful and 
over-the-top. Tori Spelling is criminally underused. She gets to have wild 
sex with the invisible man, but not much else. I was waiting for a `90210' 
gag or her dad to pop out from somewhere. </P>
<P>The biggest surprise of all may be that Scary Movie 2 seems tamer than the 
original. Oh sure there's abundant sex humor, but America has become less 
taboo about these issues since the original's release. Whether tamer or more 
outrageous, there's plenty of laughs here for a normal person to have a great 
time, and a Joe-Lieberman-person to start fuming. </P>
