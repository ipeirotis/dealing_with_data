<PRE>                                FRENCH KISS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1995 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Director Lawrence Kasdan's latest movie is a romantic comedy
called FRENCH KISS.  The trademark of Kasdan's films (GRAND CANYON, BIG
CHILL, and BODY HEAT) are the people.  All of his actors have unique
and compelling personalities.  Moreover, his projects (GRAND CANYON,
WYATT EARP, and SILVERADO) frequently have an epic feel to them.  This
was one of his non-epic movies, but it certainly was populated with
some fascinating and quirky characters.  I want to confess up front
that GRAND CANYON was number one on my list in 1991 and BIG CHILL was
in 1983 so I am huge fan of Kasdan's body of work.</P>
<P>     FRENCH KISS tells the story of Kate (Meg Ryan) an American who is
in the process of renouncing her American citizenship so that she can
become a Canadian and marry her fiance, a Canadian doctor played by
Timothy Hutton.  She is deadly afraid of flying.  In an initial,
hilarious sequence, she fails a fear of flying school and refuses to
travel with the doctor to a conference in Paris.  While there, he meets
Juliet (Susan Anbeh), a French "goddess", and tells Kate he is leaving
her for Juliet.  Kate goes to Paris and on the plane sits next to Luc,
a French thief, played in a tour de force performance by Kevin Klein.
Most of the movie has Luc trying to help Kate get the doctor back.
There is also a significant subplot involving a stolen necklace and the
chase by a the policeman (Jean Reno) to get it back.</P>
<P>     The writing by Adam Brooks was quite funny.  The interchanges
between Kate and Luc were precious.  He was crude and she was innocent,
and the dialog was filled with them exchanging great one liners in a
natural fashion of a real conversation rather than that of two great
comics.  Brooks did add one scene which was a long sight gag with Kate
falling on a dessert cart and crawling on her knees to avoid being seen
by the doctor.  This piece of slapstick was pathetic and belonged, if
anywhere, in another movie.  I have no idea why the editor left it in.</P>
<P>     Kasdan's directing was in the style of the BIG CHILL but with more
comedy and less pretense about the need to deliver a message.  Granted,
there was a message in the movie, but it was subtle and tertiary to the
plot and the subplot.  My respect for Kasdan's craft continues.</P>
<P>     I frequently will think more of the writer or the director than
the actors in a movie because writers and directors are the unsung
heroes who are the determinates of whether a picture moves you or bores
you.  In FRENCH KISS, as good as the writing and the directing was, it
was ultimately the incredible performance by Kevin Kline that made the
movie.  He owned every scene he was in.  Every time he opened his mouth
you were wondering how he was going to deliver his next line and what
his body language would be.</P>
<P>     Kline is a versatile actor who has made the screen come alive in
many other films.  My two recent favorite roles of his were in DAVE and
in PRINCESS CARABOO - both of which I recommend highly.  [I got a
letter to the editor of Fortune Magazine about DAVE published so it
will always have a special place in my memory.] Kline as Luc was at the
top of his form.  There is no role of his, including his Academy Award
winning role in A FISH CALLED WANDA, that I liked better.  This film
has to be rated a must see for all of you Kevin Kline fans.</P>
<P>     I would go to see any film with Meg Ryan in it.  She is cute,
captivating, and intelligent yet always child-like and vulnerable.
>From her best film (WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN) to her funniest (WHEN
HARRY MET SALLY) she has always dominated any picture she is in.  She
is like the sun and the other actors circle her.  In FRENCH KISS, she
is terrific and yet, her performance pales in comparison to Kline's.
This is his movie.</P>
<P>     In the year 1980, Timothy Hutton was brilliant in ORDINARY PEOPLE.
It has been straight down hill for him ever since.  He has been so bad
in many recent films, e.g., MADE IN HEAVEN, that they made my worst of
the year list.  He stays consistent and never bothers to act or show
any emotion in FRENCH KISS.  This is no easy feat since he is being
actively pursued by someone as cute as Ryan and as drop down dead
gorgeous as Anbeh.  Most men might suffer a major meltdown just being
in the same rooms with these two.  Hutton manages to be oblivious to
both.  Major control I suppose or ice water in his veins.</P>
<P>     The acting by the minor characters is good.  Reno plays the cop
with a fresh approach.  I especially liked the acting by Anbeh, who
takes a minor part with almost no lines, and manages to make the just
stand there and look beautiful role interesting.</P>
<P>     I wish I knew the names of the costume designers and the makeup
artists since I think they deserve special mention.  The costumes,
especially the evolution of the costumes and the makeup for the two
women leads was a key to the success of the film.  Watch how they make
Kate go from innocent and cute (sexiest belly button I have seen in a
long time) to gorgeous and how they take Juliet in just the opposite
direction.  You can see it in the clothes, the make up, and in Juliet's
later, stark hairdos.  Finally, notice the evolution of the doctor's
clothes.  They get more and more outrageous until he becomes a
caricature of an American playboy on the continent.</P>
<P>     The cinematography was striking without ever being traveloguesque.
The outside glow against the shadow of the bodies in the hotel was
beautiful.  If you notice the fade to black of the most of the scenes,
it fades fast at first but then lingers until only a dark shadow
against a black background remains reminiscent of a memory locked into
our subconsciousness.</P>
<P>     As someone who grew up in the 50s and 60s, I liked the double
meaning of the title.  When I was a young boy, a French Kiss was a
proscribed activity that you giggled about in the schoolyard and yet
anxiously and fervently awaited your first chance at it.</P>
<P>     FRENCH KISS runs just right at 1:50.  It is rated PG-13 for some
bad language, subdued sex, references to drugs, massive smoking by Luc,
and adult themes.  There were several boys in the 5-7 range when I was
there plus one 3 year old girl.  This was crazy for it surely bored
them all.  For the adult humor and romance, I would say kids older than
9 or 10 would like it.  I recommend it to you and award it ***.  For
comparison purposes, I should say that I prefer the other current
romantic comedy, While You Were Sleeping, over this one, although they
were close enough that I rated them the same.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
