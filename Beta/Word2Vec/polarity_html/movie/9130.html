<P>     Wim Wenders' THE END OF VIOLENCE offers the same type of experience 
one could expect from sitting through a David Lynch film with a 
reasonably-coherent narrative (unlike, for example, LOST HIGHWAY).  
Arguably Wenders' most disjointed film to date, THE END OF VIOLENCE is a 
neo-noir thriller that's really more about social decay and human 
isolation than it is about government conspiracies, mysterious murders, 
and missing persons. Unfortunately, it's also too long and too slow, 
and, by the time the end credits have started rolling, it has lost most 
of its energy.</P>
<P>     Wenders' narrative style is not only a little too languid, but it's 
often irritating in the erratic manner that it skips back and forth 
between divergent storylines.  The problem is that Wenders has three 
groups of characters to divide time between, and he often switches from 
one to another just when things are getting interesting.  This is 
certainly not happening by accident.  It's as if Wenders wanted to make 
the transitions as jarring and frustrating as possible.  Ultimately, 
this results in a motion picture that, despite having intriguing 
aspects, is never fully satisfying.</P>
<P>     The greatest amount of screen time is devoted to the story of big 
time movie producer Mike Max (Bill Pullman) and his wallflower wife, 
Paige (Andie MacDowell).  Mike is a hard-nosed guy with an eye on the 
bottom line.  He's never without at least one lap-top and two cellular 
phones.  For him, communication is a means of transferring necessary 
information -- nothing more.  There is certainly no emotion involved.  
His wife has decided to leave him because he never spends any time with 
her, but she lacks the ambition to actually do it.  Then, in one night, 
everything changes.  After Mike is abducted and nearly killed, he takes 
a long look at his life and doesn't like what he sees.  So, with the 
help of a group of Mexican immigrants, he disappears from sight to start 
over.</P>
<P>     Meanwhile, in a nearby observatory, computer scientist Ray Bering 
(Gabriel Byrne) spends his nights gazing through telescopes that are 
pointing down, not up.  Ray is involved in developing a top-secret 
government surveillance project that is supposed to cut down police 
response time to a crime.  However, as the project approaches fruition, 
Ray becomes concerned that, in the wrong hands, it could be horribly 
misused.  His fears are given form one night when he watches from afar 
as two men are gunned down.  </P>
<P>     The third leg of THE END OF VIOLENCE's triangular storyline 
involves the interaction between stuntwoman-turned-actress Cat (Traci 
Lind) and Detective "Doc" Brock (Loren Dean).  These two are brought 
together as a result of Mike Max's sudden disappearance.  Cat owes her 
latest screen test to Mike; Doc, a big fan of Mike's movies, is on hand 
to investigate the case.  Together, they explore what they know about 
Mike's vanishing while developing feelings for each other.  Many of 
their scenes are obviously intended as homages to the great noir 
thrillers of the '40s and '50s, with both Cat and "Doc" dressed and 
acting the parts of the stars of that era.</P>
<P>     How a viewer approaches THE END OF VIOLENCE may determine what he 
or she comes away with.  Anyone expecting a straightforward thriller is 
in for a very big disappointment.  Wenders and screenwriter Nicholas 
Klein aren't interested in answering many of the questions posed by the 
narrative -- in fact, they only hint at possible solutions to several of 
the biggest issues.  And the ending, such as it is, leaves a lot of room 
for interpretation.  On the other hand, if you approach this film as a 
study of the mutability of human nature, the need for redemption, the 
growing lack of meaningful human interaction in the electronic era, and 
the lure of violence, it has the power to involve, if not overwhelm.  
Ultimately, the noir thriller is just the means that Wenders uses to 
explore these issues.  If only he had managed to inject a little more 
life into the proceedings...</P>
<P>     The acting in THE END OF VIOLENCE seems either strangely muted or 
outrageously over-the-top.  Aside from Traci Lind and Loren Dean, who 
are pleasantly enjoyable as they imitate past performances rather than 
create something original, there isn't a single portrayal in this film 
that attracted my attention.  Bill Pullman and Gabriel Byrne are 
subdued, Andie MacDowell is unimpressive (what is it that directors see 
in her?), and the hit man duo of Pruitt Taylor Vince and John Diehl look 
like they have escaped from the set of the latest Coen Brothers' 
production.  </P>
<P>     The film's title is richly ironic because this movie is about the 
proliferation of violence, not its end.  Guns are everywhere in the 
movie, and each change of personality happens as a direct or indirect 
result of a violent encounter.  Mike, who built his fortune making 
violent action movies, rejects his old life as a result of his close 
encounter with death.  Mike's disappearance stirs Paige out of her 
perpetual state of apathy.  Ray's realization that his project is being 
perverted into a killing weapon causes him to hatch a plot.  And Mike 
learns to trust Cat only after a bruising confrontation. </P>
<P>     Wenders has packed a lot of issues into THE END OF VIOLENCE, and I 
challenge anyone to call the script "dumb."  Sadly, however, unlike the 
director's best work (THE WINGS OF DESIRE), it's neither involving nor 
magical.  THE END OF VIOLENCE offers viewers opportunities to ponder a 
variety of diverse subjects, but its overall entertainment value is less 
than one might hope for.  Great ideas and eye-catching cinematography 
only add up to a wonderful movie when they're contained in a powerful 
narrative.  And that's the one key ingredient where THE END OF VIOLENCE 
falls short.</P>
