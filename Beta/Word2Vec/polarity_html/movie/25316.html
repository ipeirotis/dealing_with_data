<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a much softened version of Irving Schulman's "The Amboy Dukes,"
a book about a rough gang of teenagers in the postwar period of
Brooklyn. Drew Pearson narrates the opening of the film, despairing
about slums as the cause of juvenile delinquency. He says it could
happen in any city where such slum conditions prevail. The City Across
the River refers to Brooklyn as being the inferior location to
Manhattan, and those who live there look to Manhattan as a place to
escape to and expand their horizons. Drew Pearson's serious voice gives
this film a documentary look; and, when we see the gang in action, it is
remindful of all those Dead End Kids' feature movies.</P>
<P>This is a tired, clichéd film, with its main selling point being all the
location shots of the city, evoking a sense of urban nostalgia. Tony
Curtis made his film debut, taking a small part as one of the Amboy
Dukes. All the gang members are stock characters and the predictable
story sheds little insight about juvenile delinquency, offering only a
square look into the grimness of street life.</P>
<P>The film's protagonist, Frank Cusack (Fernandez), is a lifeless
16-year-old, who speaks his lines as if he were stepping on some Brillo
pads. His problems are at home and in the slum environment he lives in.
His parents are hard workers, but not able to scrape enough money to
live better. His mother (Thelma Ritter) is a nag, always picking on her
husband (Luis Van Rooten) to get tougher with Frank and make him stop
hanging out with the gang. The younger sister (Sharon) is close with
Frank and yearns for the day that she can escape from this neighborhood.
Since Frank is a poor student in a vocational high school and can't
stand living at home, he either hangs around a poolroom or with the
Amboy Dukes.</P>
<P>The Dukes are hired by a local gangster Gaggy (Benedict) to work over a
restaurant owner. The gangster is the brother of a community center
counselor, Stan Albert (Stephen McNally), who tries to help the kids in
the neighborhood not get into trouble. His main purpose in life is to
make sure the neighborhood kids don't grow up to be like his brother.
Frankie is someone he sees drifting into trouble and even though he goes
out of his way to help him, he can't find a way to reach him.</P>
<P>The big event in the film is an accidental killing of Frankie's high
school shop teacher (Osterloh), which causes Frankie to realize that he
can never escape from his environment. The teacher is ironically shot by
a zip gun made in his shop class by Frankie's fellow gang member Benny
(Ramsen). The killing occurs as Frankie and Benny were struggling with
the teacher, when they asked him to put in a good word with the
principal so that their parents wouldn't have to miss a day of work to
come to school for them because they led a class riot. The murder leads
the two of them to become frightened teenagers, realizing that they are
in big trouble and ruined their life by hanging out with a tough gang
like the Amboy Dukes. Benny observes that Frank is not trustworthy when
he watches him take away another gang member's date and cheat on his own
girlfriend. The story line hinges on betrayal and lost dreams, as the
boys are trapped in the slums they grew up in.</P>
<P>This film missed what teenage life was like in the city slums by a
country mile, and instead threw together a cliché-ridden story, failing
to penetrate the individual's inward tensions and the desolation of the
neighborhood in a convincing way. The book was a popular, hard-hitting
novel. This film lost everything about the novel that was essential, and
the robotic acting didn't help. The only thing diverting about the film
was some of the odd touches: the candystore lady insulting her customers
while dispensing egg creams, and one of the Dukes called Crazy
(Shelley), who is thinking about ordering ice cream mixed with French
fries and potato salad, musing that it should taste good together, after
all he likes all those foods separately.</P>
