<PRE>                  AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     So what do you get when you cryogenically freeze a blend of 60s
spy movies like James Bond and TV series like "The Avengers" with
slapstick comedy and unthaw the mixture today?  AUSTIN POWERS:
INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY.</P>
<P>     Mike Myers, from the WAYNE'S WORLD series, plays the good Austin
Danger Powers as well as his nemesis Dr. Evil.  With never a subtle
moment, Myers's acting is always pushing the edge of the comedic
envelope.  Myers also wrote the script which relies on sight gags, like
his extra hairy chest, and puns for most of the humor.</P>
<P>     Austin, the best secret agent of the British during the
psychedelic 60s, chases Dr. Evil into the future when Dr. Evil gets
himself frozen and propelled into 1997 in a gigantic Big Boy statue.
Austin's sidekick in the past, a la Mrs. Peel from "The Avengers," is
Mrs. Kensington (Mimi Rogers), but in the future, her daughter, Ms.
Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), becomes his partner.  Ms. Kensington
tells him to call her Vanessa, but he has trouble calling women
anything other than "baby."  Although Vanessa eventually warms up to
him, his constantly asking if she wants to "shag" is tremendously
off-putting to her.  ("Shall we shag now or shall we shag later?" he
drones.)</P>
<P>     When Dr. Evil returns in 1997 from the big chill (puns come
naturally after seeing this movie), he decides to threaten the world
with destruction unless it comes up with one million dollars.  Number
Two (Robert Wagner) tells him about inflation and how he needs to ask
for more, so Dr. Evil increases his demand to one hundred billion
dollars.  A large number of jokes surround Myers's two characters
coping with how the world has changed in thirty years.  ("Groovy.
Smashing. Yea, capitalism!" Austin cheers when he learns the West has
won the Cold War.)</P>
<P>     The best part of the picture is the costumes by Deena Appel.
Austin's outfits includes one with  blue striped, skin tight pants,
blue striped coat, a bright red polka dot shirt and a contrasting
ascot.  The women have big hairdos and miniskirt outfits with bold
colors of pink, lavender, lime green, and red.  Hello, 60s.  Equally
funny are the sets by Cynthia Kay Charette.  Austin's bed in his
private jet seems straight out of a Playboy photo shoot.  Circular with
a leopard skin bedspread, it rotates while a disco light shines on it.
Austin figures that it will be a big turn on for Vanessa, but she
thinks he's crazy.</P>
<P>     Although cleavage is prominently featured, the film does the James
Bond tease of scrupulously avoiding any actual nudity.  The two best
scenes in the film have Austin and Vanessa using fruit and other
devices as fig leaves for each other to "accidentally" shield key
pieces of their anatomy from the camera.  Also, like the Bond films,
there is a woman in a minor role with an X-rated name which refers to
the size of her private parts.</P>
<P>     Myers put a lot of energy into the film's details from the
beginning right down to the elaborate action sequence ending, which is
set to the music of "Secret Agent Man."  With all of his hard work, it
is a shame that the result is a highly imaginative, but surprisingly
unfunny movie.  Cute, certainly, but nothing more.  ROMY AND MICHELE'S
HIGH SCHOOL REUNION used a similar approach and was much funnier.  As
an actor, Myers should fire his writer self.</P>
<P>     As the ending credits went up, I realized that I had never
laughed.  A few smiles, but that was it.  "There's nothing so pathetic
as an aging hipster," Austin says in the film.  I couldn't have said it
better myself.</P>
<P>     AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY runs, thankfully, just
1:27.  It is rated PG-13 for sexual situations and profanity.  The film
would be fine for kids say 10 or 11 and up.  I cannot recommend
comedies without laughs, but I will give the film ** for the quality of
its production.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
