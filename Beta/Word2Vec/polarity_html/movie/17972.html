<P>The Brylcream Boys tells the story of two prisoners of war who are 
incarcerated in the same prison camp in the Republic of Ireland 
during World War Two, and have fallen for the same girl, a local 
flame-haired beauty named Mattie Guerin (Jean Butler). There is an 
added complication that one of the prisoners is a Canadian airman, 
Miles Keogh (Bill Campbell) while the other suitor is a German 
officer, Count Rudolph Von Stegenbek (Angus McFadyen).</P>
<P>The film touches upon a little known part of Irish (and World War 
II) history. In the outbreak of war in 1939, the Republic of Ireland 
was determined to remain neutral. The country had independence (from 
Britain) for less than two decades and the leadership of both Ireland 
(De Valera) and the UK (Churchill) had been former adversaries in 
the battle for independence. The Republic had a small army with 
almost no ability to defend itself against attacks from sea or air. 
A declaration of support for the Allies would have meant that Allied 
(i.e. British) troops would have had to occupy Ireland in order to 
defend it against German attack - an prospect which had too much 
historical baggage for De Valera to contemplate. Most Irish supported 
the Allied cause and many fought in the British and (to a lesser 
extent) the US army during the war. De Valera was determined to 
preserve the appearance of neutrality throughout the war, even to 
the extent of sending the official condolences of the Irish 
government 
to the German embassy in 1945 on the death of Hitler.</P>
<P>Soldiers from both the Allied and Axis sides (mainly shot-down 
pilots, 
and some shipwrecked sailors) were imprisoned (in separate compounds) 
in the same military camp outside Dublin - in reality, many of the 
Allied pilots were allowed to return to duty by making their way 
(largely unhindered) to the border with Northern Ireland (only 50 
miles away from the camp). Security in the camp itself was lax, since 
it was understood by all that breaches of the rules would only make 
things worse for other prisoners. It was also a fact that, if one was 
fated to be a prisoner-of-war, the camp was a pretty good place to 
sit out the war.</P>
<P>What a pity that the potential for an offbeat exploration of a little 
known aspect of WWII is completely wasted by this trite and cliché-
ridden 
production. Almost every character in the film is a crudely drawn 
stereotype, from the well-meaning but stupid Irish soldiers guarding 
the camp, to the square-bashing, humourless Germans obsessed with 
discipline. Of course, Count Rudolph is a 'good' German; i.e. he 
despises the other Germans in the camp (and by implication, the Nazi 
cause). Miles Keogh is a gung-ho pilot who just wants to get back 
into 
action - he teams up with the British prisoners (absolutely 
unconvincing performances, to a man) to plan his escape. </P>
<P>The love interest arrives in the rather fetching shape of Mattie 
Guerin, who seems to hold both men in thrall merely by fluttering 
her eyelashes (perhaps because she is not capable of much else). 
Actually, that is not entirely true - this film was intended to be 
the breakthrough role for Butler. She had already achieved fame as 
the 
lead dancer (along with Michael Flatley) in Riverdance, a Celtic 
music and dance extravaganza. She gets a chance to dance in the 
film, too - but the sequence is so ineptly photographed that her 
dancing skills don't shine. Since her acting skills are not in 
evidence, I foresee a short movie career unless she can become the 
Esther Williams of Irish dancing, miraculously weaving dancing 
routines into every film. I'm not sure the world is ready for that!</P>
<P>Campbell and McFadyen don't fare much better, though the script is so 
bad, I doubt there was much either could do. McFadyen (who played 
Robert the Bruce in Braveheart) looks particularly uncomfortable 
throughout the film, as if he had realised too late what a turkey 
it would turn out to be. However, the worst performance is that of 
Gabriel Byrne (also a co-producer) who mugs and grins stupidly 
throughout the entire film. He seems to be imitating Barry 
Fitzgerald in The Quiet Man in every scene. There is a reason that 
movies like The Quiet Man isn't made any more, but at least John  
Ford knew how to invest his film with charm and whimsy. The 
Brylcream Boys possess neither - one might accept the crude 
national stereotypes if the film was at least entertaining. But it 
is not, and is simply an insult to filmgoers.</P>
