<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This 1951 film was made when America was in the middle of the demagogic
Senator McCarthy Commie witch hunts. It was originally written and
filmed as a story about Adolph Hitler surviving and living secretly in a
quiet fishing town, preparing with his fellow Nazis to conquer the world
again; but, it's remade as a story about Commies planning to destroy
America with germ warfare. Howard Hughes originally entitled it "The Man
He Found," but on second thought felt the Red-menace presented a film
with a more modern impact for audiences. Despite being shot again, the
film still cost the studio only $376,000.</P>
<P>A photo-journalist for the popular magazine, American View, Matt Corbin
(Elliot Reid), using an outdated guidebook, goes trout fishing in a lake
by a small Middle American town called Winnoga. He has a bad fishing day
since there are no fish in the water, and when leaving he accidently
hits his head on some rocks. This causes a bad gash needing medical
attention, but he takes the wrong road to town and winds up in a
secluded area that says no trespassers. When he asks for help at the
fortress like, walled-off, lakeside lodge of a Mr. Peterson (Martin),
he's met with a stern warning by the caretaker to clear out. There are
also barking guard dogs ready to tear him to pieces.</P>
<P>Reaching town, he finds few people there, but those present are
unfriendly and are peculiarly reticent. The doctor, Edward Koller (Edgar
Barrier), stitches him up, while the doc's attractive, unmarried sister,
Janet (Carla Balenda), bandages him up and shows some interest in him.
The doc tells him there are no fish here anymore, there was a virus
5-years ago that killed them all off. He's taken to the inn of Steve
Loomis (Burr), who encourages him to go tomorrow to another spot where
there is great fishing. The only person in town who will talk to him is
an ornery 79-year-old storekeeper, Luther Adams (Frank Darien), who
tells him this town has changed into a ghost town since the newcomers
have come here about the same time the virus hit. They bought up all the
land real cheap, and are always spying on him while remaining secretive
about their activities. Luther was one of the few old-timers who refused
to sell and leave.</P>
<P>The action picks up when the journalist is sure he smells a good story
here, and decides not to go fishing but stay and write the story of a
town that became deserted because there were no fish in the lake. When
he snoops by the lakeside lodge, he spots scientific experiments going
on and they are being carried out by someone he recognizes -- a crazed
Nazi scientist named Bucholtz (Otto Waldis), wanted for war crimes by
our government,  who disappeared behind the Iron Curtain in 1946.</P>
<P>He runs into problems of how to get word to the outside world since his
car is put out of use by them and the telephone operator, Molly (Lurene
Tuttle), listens in to all calls made and refuses to connect outside
calls she doesn't approve of.</P>
<P>Luther ingeniously gets Matt's message, warning of Bucholtz being
located, to his magazine editor through his delivery men, and the editor
notifies the FBI. But Matt realizes that it's dangerous to remain in
town and talks Janet into taking the boat across the lake to escape from
the Commies who have taken over the town. It turns out even her brother
is willing to kill her, and there's no one around to help the two
escapees since her brother murdered Luther with a lethal drug injection.
They, thereby, get trapped and are taken to the lodge as prisoners.
Bucholtz tells them they will be used as guinea pigs for experiments on
germ warfare, as he has many other human subjects in a drugged zombie
condition behind locked doors. These are political prisoners of the
Commies, as the experiments done on them will make it possible for
Commie agents on the ground to use the germs developed to destroy the
water system, infect the population with bubonic plague, and destroy all
the American cities.</P>
<P>Warning: spoiler in the next paragraph.</P>
<P>The climax comes when the Feds blast their way through the Commie
compound and Janet's brother can't go through with destroying his
sister, as he ends up giving up his life to help her. The evil Bucholtz,
when confronted by the Feds, has locked himself in the glass
experimental room with all the other walking dead guinea pigs and
threatens to explode a bomb which will disperse the deadly germs across
America. But Matt manages to get the key from the doctor and tackle the
lunatic scientist just in time.</P>
<P>For a propaganda film, this one is not bad. It's far superior to other
such films on this topic made during the 1950s (such as The Red Menace).
Of course, the story of a Commie town made up of ex-Nazis prospering in
the middle of America is hard to swallow, but as sheer entertainment
value this one somehow works. It's directed by the very capable auteur,
William Cameron Menzies, the noted art director whose talents greatly
enhanced films such as GWTW.</P>
