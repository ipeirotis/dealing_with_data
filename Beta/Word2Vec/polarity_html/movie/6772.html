<P>     As the opening scenes of PREFONTAINE unfold, you could be excused for
worrying about its prospects as a drama.  Those scenes include a lot of
documentary-style footage of track races, as well as "talking head" shots
of the actors playing Steve Prefontaine's friends and family, complete
with captions identifying the characters.  Is Steve James, director of the
acclaimed 1994 documentary HOOP DREAMS, simply planning to tick off the
significant events of Prefontaine's life, accompanied by predictably
glowing commentary?  Is he going to be able to tell us a story?  Well,
anyone concerned about James' ability as a story-teller didn't see HOOP
DREAMS.  Though he may have a few things to learn about directing actors
and writing dialogue, James crafts PREFONTAINE into a compelling character
study which takes surprising turns for a sports film.</P>
<P>     Jared Leto stars as Steve "Pre" Prefontaine, a distance-running
prodigy from the small Oregon town of Coos Bay.  Courted out of high
school in 1969 by dozens of colleges, Pre opts to stay close to home and
attend the University of Oregon, where nationally renowned coach Bill
Bowerman (R. Lee Ermey) leads the track team.  Pre's intense desire to win
makes him an instant success, transcending the sport to become a celebrity
who brings attention to the previously under-appreciated 5,000 meter
event.  With success comes high expectations, however, and Pre heads to
the 1972 Munich Olympics favored to take home a gold medal.  Then tragedy
strikes in Munich, changing the complexion of the Games and setting up a
showdown with Swedish sensation Lasse Viren (Tracy Hollister) which will
change Pre's life forever.</P>
<P>     One of the things which makes PREFONTAINE more satisfying than the
average underdog-makes-good bio-pic is that the style gives it a unique
rhythm.  James has cinematographer Peter Gilbert employ a hand-held camera
for many sequences, creating a kind of urgent energy which matches
Prefontaine's personality.  The script does an efficient job of
establishing how his lack of success as an under-sized youth baseball and
football player drove him to find a place where his refusal to surrender
would be enough, as well as the arrogant sense of personal invincibility
which often made him reckless.  Jared Leto (heartthrob Jordan Catalano
from "My So-Called Life") gives a naturalistic performance encouraged by
the documentary style, but his intensity isn't always as convincing as
it could be.  He has the golden boy charisma down pat, without all the
ferocity.</P>
<P>     He is convincing enough, however, to make the arc of his character
intriguing.  The pivot point of PREFONTAINE is Pre's Olympic final, which
is delayed by the terrorist attack on the Israeli athletes in the Olympic
village; as Pre's doubts begin to grow, the race becomes a frightening
first opportunity to fail.  Then PREFONTAINE makes the unexpected choice
not to be about whether or not Pre wins his race, but about how he
responds to a disappointing result.  James' use of documentary clips from
the Olympics does slow the film down somewhat, but it also establishes the
1972 Olympics as a kind of turning point in the perception of "amateur"
athletics.  As Pre becomes an unlikely advocate for the rights of amateur
athletes, and for reforms in the governing process, his character shifts
from a youth obsessed with the idea that only winning can earn him respect
to a man who learns to find success in different ways.  Most sports movies
are about the main character(s) winning, and a few are about  the main
character(s) just doing their best.  I can't think of many other sports
movies which were about a character who learns to define himself apart
from his sport.</P>
<P>     There are plenty of places Steve James betrays his inexperience with
fiction film-making, notably with some flat characters like Pre's
girlfriend Nancy (Amy Locane) and the tough-but-caring coach played with
enthusiasm by R. Lee Ermey, as well as a pace which makes PREFONTAINE feel
long at only 105 minutes.  Yet there are two scenes in which James shows
the kind of handle he has on his material.  The first is the Olympic 5,000
meter race, directed with a pulse-quickening energy; you know someone is
doing an exceptional job of film-making if you know the result of the race
and you are still sitting on the edge of your seat.  The second is more
subtle, but perhaps more important to the impact of Prefontaine's story.
After showing us a number of early scenes in which the cocky Pre races his
MG around treacherous curves, James gives us a late scene in which Pre,
filled with satisfaction after organizing a successful challenge match
with the Swedish national team, drives home from a party.  There is an
almost subliminal cut-away to his speedometer, showing him driving a
cautious 35 miles per hour when he collides with another car.  Prefontaine
died in the crash at the age of 24, and the success of PREFONTAINE as a
film comes from the fact that we appreciate this tragedy not as the loss
of a fine athlete, but as the loss of someone who was becoming a fine
human being.  A subtle distinction, perhaps, but one which separates
mediocre directors from good ones.  Steve James knows his film-making,
whether the subject is fact or fiction.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 gold medals:  7.</PRE>
