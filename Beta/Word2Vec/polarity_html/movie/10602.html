<PRE>                            OSCAR & LUCINDA
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ** 1/2</PRE>
<P>     There is a moment in OSCAR & LUCINDA in which Oscar Hopkins lets
the direction of his life be decided by the flip of a coin.  In an
Anglican seminary because of a similar rock toss years earlier, his
trembling hand pushes a large coin toward one of his fellow
seminarians.  Heads he leaves, and tails he stays.  As Oscar, an
emaciated Ralph Fiennes shrinks into the corner and trembles as his
future is determined.  Almost convulsing with fear, he finds that he
will be going.</P>
<P>     Looking boyish and unstable, Fiennes again proves the wide range
of his acting talent.  Oscar, an obsessive and generally successful
gambler, gives his money away to the poor, not that it gets him any
praise from the locals.  Describing their bizarre minister as someone
who "dresses like a scarecrow and looks like one too," no one
understands him, least of all himself.  All he knows is that he is an
obsessive gambler.  In a deliciously dense monologue he argues the
commonality of Christianity and gambling.  "We bet that there is a
God," he claims is one of the fundamental tenants of his religion.</P>
<P>     Into his life, set in England and Australia in the mid-1800s,
comes a compulsive gambler, Lucinda Leplastrier, played with a certain
charm by Cate Blanchett.  (The show suggests at one point that there is
a difference between a compulsive gambler and an obsessive one,  but
does not explain what that might be.)  Lucinda inherits a fortune,
which she uses to purchase a glass factory.</P>
<P>     When Lucinda shows Oscar a model of a glass building, he has an
inspiration.  "It is like a kennel for God's angels," he declares,
seeing a church when she saw merely an exhibit hall.</P>
<P>     Like Werner Herzog's powerful film FITZCARRALDO about an opera
house in the jungle, the crux of the story deals with moving the
materials for a large building in a hostile and primitive setting.
Oscar makes Lucinda a wager about whether he can transport all the
pieces for a glass church across the Australian outback.  "I dare not
hope, and yet I must that through this deed I gain your trust," he
explains his motivation in his letter to her.</P>
<P>     Potentially the most interesting part of the movie, the outback
excursion gets little screen time.  Most of the movie is devoted to
Oscar and his worries about his gambling.</P>
<P>     I had major problems with screenwriter Laura Jones's last
pictures, A THOUSAND ACRES and THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY, and this one was
only marginally better.  Adapted from a novel by Peter Carey, the movie
has trouble creating compelling characters.  They are certainly
interesting to watch, as are the inviting images by LITTLE WOMEN's
cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson, but they have no depth.  Some of the
language is poetic but rarely is it involving.  Quirkiness can carry a
picture just so far, and at two and a quarter hours, the movie begins
to wear out its welcome long before the ending credits roll.  The rich
and constant narration by Geoffrey Rush suggests a larger meaning than
the story has.</P>
<P>     "You will preach what you do not believe to men who do not care,"
Lucinda chides another of her Anglican minister admirers.  Similarly,
the movie tries to mesmerize us with its whimsy but doesn't seem to
believe in its own material.  The show does have its delights, but too
often we simply don't care.  With tighter editing and better character
development, the movie and its enjoyment potential could have been
enhanced immensely.</P>
<P>     OSCAR & LUCINDA runs 2:14.  It is rated R for violence, sex, and
brief nudity and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
