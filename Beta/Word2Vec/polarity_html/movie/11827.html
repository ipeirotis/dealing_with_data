<PRE>"Mercury Rising" (USA, 1998)
A Film Review by James Kendrick</PRE>
<P>Director: Harold Becker
Screenwriter: Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal
(based on the novel "Simple Simon" by Ryne Douglas
Pearson)
Stars: Bruce Willis (Art Jeffries), Alec Baldwin
(Nicholas Kudrow),  Miko Hughes (Simon Lynch), Chi
McBride (Bizzi Jordan), Kim Dickens (Stacey)
MPAA Rating: R.
Review: *1/2 (out of ****).</P>
<P>"Mercury Rising" has numerous flaws, but there is
one that really stands out: its central plot
device is unnecessary. That's right. The major
aspect of the film, that which is supposed to make
it different from other routine government
conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from
the beginning, and the movie would turn out
exactly the same, if not better.</P>
<P>This central device is the fact that a
nine-year-old boy is autistic. His name is Simon,
and an evil government bureaucrat named Nicholas
Kudrow (Alec Baldwin) wants him dead because he
unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code
slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its
programmers just to see if someone could beat it.
Simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the
film, and we are supposed to feel for him because
he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a
violent, unfair world against his will, with only
a renegade FBI agent played by Bruce Willis to
protect him.</P>
<P>The fact that he is autistic does nothing for the
emotional intensity or the plot necessities of
"Mercury Rising." I suppose the original novel
upon which the movie was based did much more with
this aspect of Simon's character and his
relationship with Willis, but here it is lost.
Miko Hughes, the young actor who plays Simon, goes
through the prescribed motions of being autistic:
he walks slowly, drawls his words, kicks and
screams when he's touched, and has a hard time
looking at other people. It's a difficult role for
an adult, much less a young child, to play, and
unfortunately Hughes never convinces us that he
isn't playing like he's autistic. Unlike Dustin
Hoffman's performance in "Rain Man" or Leonardo
DiCaprio's in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," we
are always painfully aware that Hughes is
<I>acting</I>.</P>
<P>However, unlike "Rain Man" which used its
character's autism in unique and interesting ways
to build a credible and touching story, "Mercury
Rising" could go right about its generic,
predictable plot with Simon being simply a really
smart but really shy kid. Hell, he doesn't even
have to be shy. In fact, the movie might have been
more interesting if he had had a more active role,
rather than just being carted around under Willis'
arm.</P>
<P>Willis' character, Art Jeffries, is a
disillusioned FBI agent who has been removed from
undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like
listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy
to be doing anything. He becomes involved with
Simon when he is called to check out a murder
scene at Simon's house, where his father has
apparently shot his mother in the back and then
committed suicide.</P>
<P>Of course, we know that isn't the way it happened
happen because we saw an evil, square-jawed
government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut
knock off the parents. Simon was able to get away,
and Jeffries finds him hiding in a secret
compartment in a closet, which the rest of the
Chicago police department had overlooked. Jeffries
-- who is accused by several characters at
different times of being paranoid although his
actions never suggest it -- knows there is
something more, and he makes it his personal
mission to go against everything and everyone in
order to protect Simon. This is quite a task
because that same hitman who knocked off Simon's
parents is crawling everywhere, attempting to kill
Simon at the hospital, on the highway, and every
other place he goes.</P>
<P>Late in the movie, Jeffries is forced to enlist
the aid of a pretty young woman named Stacey (Kim
Dickens) who he meets at a coffee shop. Of all the
hard-to-believe aspects of the movie, this is the
worst. I can believe in the decency of the human
heart, but Stacey's character is far too
accommodating. Not only does she agree to watch
Simon while Jeffries runs off to solve the
mystery, she lets him into her apartment at two
o'clock in the morning when she knows the police
is after him, and then lets him leave Simon in her
apartment which means that she has to forgo a
business trip that is desperately needed to pay
the rent. The grinding squeals of the rusty plot
machine are almost overbearing at this point.</P>
<P>The movie might have been redeemed by some good
action sequences, but even here "Mercury Rising"
doesn't rise to the challenge. The movie was
directed by Harold Becker, who has made some good
suspense films including "Sea of Love" (1989) and
"Malice" (1993), but his talent is nowhere to be
found in this latest excursion. There is one fight
on a streetcar between Jeffries and another hitman
(played by Peter Stormare) that is so ineptly
directed, shot and edited, that I had no idea 1)
exactly where they were on the streetcar, 2) who
was hitting who, and 3) where this hitman came
from and how he knew where Jeffries and Simon
were. The grand finale takes place on the roof of
a tall building, and features a harrowing (yawn)
scene where Simon walks along the very edge of the
building, not because he has to, but because it's
more suspenseful that way.</P>
<P>Taken as a whole, "Mercury Rising" is an tepid,
confused movie that lacks style, wit, and any
traces of a sense of humor. Usually Willis brings
his personal brand of understated humor to his
roles, but here he is too straight and serious.
This is because the movie wants to be an action
flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time, but
it ends up failing on both fronts. Maybe the book
was better, but the way it's handled here is a
perfect case study in formula filmmaking
guaranteed to bore.</P>
