<P>     Have you ever felt that you should be sobbing uncontrollably during 
a movie, but can't find the motivation or energy to shed a single tear?  
That's the way it is with HOPE FLOATS, an insipid, stillborn drama that 
drags its viewers through a ghetto of despair before finally, 
unexpectedly plopping them down in the midst of a happy ending.  This 
isn't just a tearjerker, it's an inept tearjerker, and only the most 
undiscriminating audience members will be suckered in by its obviously 
manipulative methods, which include the breakup of a marriage, tension 
between mothers and daughters, and a death that brings everyone 
together.</P>
<P>     For my part, I sat dry-eyed through all 115 minutes of HOPE FLOATS, 
since its calculated, by-the-numbers methods of plot development failed 
to generate any kind of emotional response.  But that's not the film's 
worst failing, because, beyond all the attempts to sell Kleenexes, HOPE 
FLOATS is boring.  This is typical of a motion picture that favors stock 
melodramatic situations over genuine character-building moments.  
Despite the presence of a clear protagonist, it's hard to connect with 
anyone, because there's so little substance to grab onto.  Throughout 
HOPE FLOATS, I found the situations to be predictable and the people to 
be lifeless.  </P>
<P>     The story centers around Birdee Pruitt (Sandra Bullock), the one-
time Corn Queen of Smithville, Texas, who, after marrying her high-
school sweetheart, Bill (Michael Pare), moved to Chicago where she had a 
daughter, Bernice (Mae Whitman), and spent her days keeping house.  One 
day, Birdee agrees to appear on the Toni Post Show, a TV talkshow in the 
Jerry Springer mold.  There, in front of a national audience, Birdee's 
best friend tells the unsuspecting housewife that she has been having an 
affair with Bill and that the two of them love each other.  Days later, 
Birdee leaves her husband, and, with Bernice in tow, returns to the 
small town where she grew up.  She moves back in with her mother, Ramona 
(Gena Rowlands), and kindles a romance with Justin (Harry Connick Jr.), 
a one-time schoolmate who used to have a crush on her.  During the 
course of the proceedings, we are treated to numerous cliches of the 
genre, including a depressed person who shows the depth of her 
despondency by walking around aimlessly in a downpour and an elderly 
lady who cures all of her granddaughter's woes with one wise bedtime 
story.</P>
<P>     Despite the generic plot, HOPE FLOATS actually allows a few 
worthwhile ideas to bob to the surface, although it never does much with 
them.  The first, and most prominent, is the concept that people who 
pursue what they love to do for a living often make so many compromises 
that they end up hating their career choice (this is why Justin gave up 
a lucrative job designing houses and now does it only as a hobby).  Then 
there's the issue of how a person who changes to please someone else 
often loses himself or herself (and the things the other person loved 
about them) in the process.  Had HOPE FLOATS paid more than token lip 
service to these story elements, the script might have offered something 
more memorable.</P>
<P>     Sandra Bullock's stay on the A-list of actresses lasted about two 
years and four films.  Following her disastrous cruise into money with 
SPEED 2, she has been largely forgotten about.  HOPE FLOATS isn't likely 
to help her regain lost ground.  As she already proved in Richard 
Attenborough's IN LOVE AND WAR, her dramatic range is limited, and it 
shows here, where she's required to play a drab, depressed woman who has 
lost all self-respect.  To give her credit, Bullock is actually better 
in this role than I expected, but she's still miscast.  Part of the 
problem is that her undisputed strength lies in a blend of light drama 
and comedy, but this overwrought production doesn't offer her much 
opportunity to play to that.  To make matters worse, she isn't abetted 
by the supporting cast.  Harry Connick Jr. may be pleasing to the eye 
and ear, but his emoting is wooden.  Gena Rowlands, who has given 
countless memorable performances in past outings, is strangely muted.  
And young Mae Whitman is unappealingly strident.</P>
<P>     Based on his admittedly-limited resume behind the camera, actor-
turned-film maker Forest Whitaker seems to prefer this kinds of 
manipulative tale -- his directorial debut, 1995's surprise hit, WAITING 
TO EXHALE, displays many of the same traits.  HOPE FLOATS is rambling, 
uneven, and inexcusably long for a motion picture that develops such a 
poor emotional connection with the lead character.  After a while, the 
film, which offers an occasional worthwhile moment to keep it from 
becoming unwatchable, turns into something of an endurance contest.  In 
the end, HOPE FLOATS sinks.</P>
