<P>     In 1997 movies, the White House is under siege, although not as 
literally as in last year's INDEPENDENCE DAY.  No less than three major 
motion pictures released between New Year's Day and the twilight of the 
summer season have stories that postulate high level government cover-
ups.  The first, SHADOW CONSPIRACY, was a terrible film that vanished 
from theaters almost as soon as it opened.  The third, MURDER AT 1600, 
is slated for a warm weather bow, and will feature Wesley Snipes as a 
police officer investigating a homicide on the grounds of the White 
House.  In between these two pictures comes Clint Eastwood's ABSOLUTE 
POWER, a fairly routine thriller that gets high marks as a result of 
tight pacing and top-notch acting.</P>
<P>     In 1993's IN THE LINE OF FIRE, Eastwood played a Secret Service 
agent.  Here, he's hunted by a pair of them.  Frankly, the actor seems 
equally comfortable on either side of the badge, just as he does on 
either side of the camera.  Unlike UNFORGIVEN and THE BRIDGES OF MADISON 
COUNTY, there's nothing remarkable about this motion picture; ABSOLUTE 
POWER is a straightforward thriller that, while entertaining, will not 
go down as an example of Eastwood's best work.</P>
<P>     Luther Whitney (Eastwood) is a master thief; he's one of only six 
people who can defeat the Sullivan mansion's alarm system.  Once inside, 
he makes his way into the bedroom, finds the hidden vault, and proceeds 
to fill his bag with cash and jewelry.  But this isn't Luther's night.  
Just as he's finishing up the robbery, the lady of the house (Melora 
Hardin) arrives home with a gentleman guest.  Luther is forced to hide 
in the vault, behind a one-way mirror.  What he sees next not only 
shocks him, but makes him the target of a hit man, the Secret Service, 
and the Washington D.C. police.  Christy Sullivan's inebriated escort is 
none other than Alan J. Richmond (Gene Hackman), the President of the 
United States.  And, after some rough foreplay, she's dead and a cover-
up is underway. Luther witnesses all this from his hiding place, but 
it's not long before the detective leading the murder investigation, 
Seth Frank (Ed Harris), realizes that the aging thief was in the house 
when the crime occurred.  But was he a witness or a participant?</P>
<P>     ABSOLUTE POWER, adapted by veteran screenwriter William Goldman 
from the novel by David Baldacci, is an intriguing story told in an 
effective manner.  It's entertaining for the most part, sporadically 
clever, and occasionally gripping, but thoughtful viewers will easily 
recognize a number of sizable plot holes.  This is one movie that looks 
better while you're watching it than when you reflect upon it 
afterwards.  Ultimately, the reason to see ABSOLUTE POWER is for the 
pleasure of the cat-and-mouse game between Luther and everyone who's out 
to get him.  The end isn't the fun part; getting there is.  At the 
appropriate moments, Eastwood ratchets up the level of tension to keep 
us involved.  </P>
<P>     The "A-list" cast for ABSOLUTE POWER says a great deal for the 
prestige of the project and Eastwood's reputation.  The director plays 
Luther as a sage, somewhat laid back character -- more like BRIDGES' 
protagonist than Dirty Harry.  Hackman, who last worked with Eastwood on 
UNFORGIVEN, is effectively amoral as the president (some viewers may be 
reminded of the actor's previous cover-up/conspiracy thriller, NO WAY 
OUT, where Hackman's Secretary of State accidentally killed his 
mistress).  Judy Davis (HUSBANDS AND WIVES) plays Gloria Russell, 
Richmond's Chief of Staff and the author of the cover-up.  Scott Glenn 
(SILVERADO) and Dennis Haysbert (LOVE FIELD) are the Secret Service 
agents involved in the plot.  Laura Linney (PRIMAL FEAR) is Luther's 
estranged daughter, whose uncertain relationship with her father leads 
to the film's most emotionally honest moments.  E.G. Marshall is the 
extremely wealthy husband of the dead woman.</P>
<P>     In the wrong hands, ABSOLUTE POWER could have resulted in a 
splashy, inept film.  For, while the material here is inherently better 
than that of SHADOW CONSPIRACY, it takes strong performances and a sure, 
steady hand at the helm to lift the production above the level of its 
uneven script.  Eastwood's approach is slow and deliberate; he develops 
characters and relationships and doesn't rely on cheap gimmicks to 
generate tension.  The favorable result speaks for itself.  The final 
cut of ABSOLUTE POWER isn't shocking or surprising, but seeing it is 
worth the commitment of a couple of hours on a cold February night.  </P>
