Shrek
Rating: * * * * out of * * * *
Rated PG: mild language, crude humor, some sexual innuendo.
Starring the voices of...Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, John Lithgow.
Directed by: Andrew Adamson, Vicky Jenson</P>
<P>Back in 1998 Dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie "Antz". 
The film was critically acclaimed, and went on to gross almost $100m dollars 
at the domestic box office. Again in 1998 they released their traditional 
animated film "The Prince of Egypt" and it named an instant classic, and 
became a huge hit as well. On a winning streak, they released "The Road to El 
Dorado" and it wasn't as big as they hoped, but still did ok, then they had 
the fantastic "Chicken Run" in the summer. Now in 2001 Dreamworks has 
released what I can safely name, one of the top five best animated films.</P>
<P>Shrek (Mike Myers) is about a loving, green Ogre who lives in the woods of 
Duloc by himself. Surrounded by fairy tale characters, he hopes somehow he 
would escape from everyone. The ruler of Duloc is the short, heartless Lord 
Farquaad (John Lithgow), who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale 
creatures, if they are captured and arrested. Of course many of the owners 
turn them in for gold and silver, but one of those creatures is Donkey (Eddie 
Murphy). A regular donkey, except he talks and has a definite attitude, after 
his owner tries to disown him, he escapes into the woods, and runs into 
Shrek. Lord Farquaad however, has different plans and makes all the fairy 
tale creatures in the woods near Shrek's house. To get his property back, and 
his life back Shrek must rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so Lord 
Farquaad can be a king. Shrek wants his property back, but he never thought 
he would fall in love with Princess Fiona.</P>
<P>"Shrek" is such an amazing film, that while watching it you can't help but 
just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company can't 
make movies like this. The animated graphics are so great, that they look 
every bit of realistic. I saw previews for this film all last year, and I 
thought to myself wow, what a great movie this will be. I must say I was not 
disappointed at all, and the film is the best of 2001 so far, and will go 
down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year.</P>
<P>The voice talents are brilliant as well, with the comic genius Mike Myers. In 
the past he has been a Wayne, an Austin, and a person married to an ax 
murderer. Now he is Shrek, not only does he do the voice talent...but he IS 
Shrek. With his Irish accent, and he lovable personality, Shrek becomes a 
friend to the audience and warms your heart.</P>
<P>Eddie Murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s "Mulan" does another bang 
up job here, and he is the comic relief in the film. The tones of his voice, 
the lines he utters, and the jokes he gives, he even outdoes the comic genius 
of Robin Williams in "Aladdin". The always beautiful Cameron Diaz gives the 
voice of Princess Fiona and she does a great job as well. She is very funny, 
and her character fits her to a T. Of course the best supporting voice is 
John Lithgow, who is personally one of my favorite actors. He as the bad guy 
Lord Farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same 
time.</P>
<P>At times I was so amazed by the computer graphics, that you can't help but 
just start looking at backgrounds. There is many hidden jokes in the film, 
and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera. "Shrek" is a 
definite kid film, but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire 
family to enjoy. There are many adult jokes in the film that the kids won't 
get, but the parents will be laughing. Believe me though, everyone will be 
laughing the entire way through.</P>
<P>In the end, "Shrek" gives a very important message to it's audience to enjoy 
and be who you are. Everybody out there is beautiful in their own way, even 
though it may be inside. There's not many words that can praise "Shrek" 
enough, but my words to you is to stop what you are doing and see this movie 
now. </P>
