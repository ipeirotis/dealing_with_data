SOME LIKE IT HOT
A film by Billy Wilder
Starring: Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Joe E. Brown
  </PRE>
<P>A miracle of filmmaking, "Some Like It Hot" is a brilliant film, and
maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with
clever sight gags and plot twists.  It is the pinnacle of writer-director
Billy Wilder's career, a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of
films he had helped make.</P>
<P>Jerry (Lemmon) and Joe (Curtis) are two stage musicians who go from gig
to gig, trying to earn enough money to feed themselves.  One night, as
they're playing at a banned Prohibition speakeasy, the place is raided.  As
it turns out, the owner, Spats Columbo (George Raft) was ratted out by
Toothpick Charlie (George E. Stone).  Several weeks later, on Valentine's
Day, Jerry and Joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a
gangland murder of Charlie by Columbo in a parking garage.  Eager to
escape, the duo are forced to take a job in Florida with all expenses paid.
 The only catch..its a girls band.  So Josephine (Curtis) and Daphne
(Lemmon), make their way onto the train and go to Florida.  On the way
there, they meet Sugar Kane (Monroe), a bombshell singer who is looking for
love.  Jerry and Joe immediately fall for the singer, but there's two
problems: 1) they're in drag, and 2) millionaire Osgood Fielding (Joe E.
Brown) falls madly in love with Daphne.  What follows in pure hysteria,
still complicated further by the arrival of Spats Columbo to Florida for
the "Italian Opera Lovers Festival".  </P>
<P>Tony Curtis is hysterical as Joe/Josephine, especially in his
preposterous attempts to woo Sugar.  Marilyn Monroe, in a wonderfully comic
performance, is Sugar, providing incredible timing and sex appeal, along
with true sincerity.  The scenes, however, are all stolen by either Brown
or Lemmon.  Lemmon is hysterical as Daphne. Cast as the less rational one,
Lemmon's performance is ridiculously crazy, it is disorder in the style all
Billy Wilder's.  Brown is particularly hilarious as Osgood, as we are
treated to the finest kind of comedic irony.  He manages to use Lemmon's
ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a
completely eccentric millionaire.</P>
<P>Every set-piece is flawless, as Wilder brilliantly changes settings
constantly, and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture.
Wilder's script is stunning, as he carefully combines gangsters,
cross-dressing, romance, sex, music, gender roles, and social taboos in a
riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness.  Wilder manages to create
scenes of utter hysteria, so pitch-perfect that the audience is dying of
laughter with the last comic piece, the final line of this absolutely
incredible film.  Wilder's is dead wrong when he says nobody's perfect:
Billy Wilder is, especially when he makes something this disastrously
funny.  Nobody's perfect but Billy Wilder.
