<P>     The scenery is great, the actors are appealing, and the special 
effects are suitably low-key… all that's missing from Ivan Reitman's SIX 
DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS is a plot with a moment's originality.  This movie 
takes chunks from ROMANCING THE STONE, THE AFRICAN QUEEN, FROM HERE TO 
ETERNITY, and even "Gilligan's Island", throws them into a blender set 
on "puree," and hopes we won't recognize the familiar taste that 
results.  Actually, there are moments when Harrison Ford and Anne Heche 
almost make us forget that we've seen all this before.  Their tropical 
island romance has its high points, and certain early portions of the 
film hint at an unfulfilled promise.  Then the pirates show up.</P>
<P>     Being stranded on an island is a common fantasy.  It's also one of 
those things that no one in their right mind would want to have really 
happen.  In keeping with this notion, everything in SIX DAYS, SEVEN 
NIGHTS is neat, sanitary, and relatively pleasant.  There are fresh 
peacocks ready to be skewered and eaten.  No one develops diarrhea after 
drinking the water.  The indigenous life appears to be relatively 
harmless (a scorpion and a snake both take a liking to Heche, but 
neither appears predisposed to turn nasty).  All-in-all, it appears to 
be the perfect place to spend a vacation.  Until those pesky pirates 
turn up, that is.</P>
<P>     The story is predictably thin.  A young, newly-engaged couple, 
Robin (Heche) and Frank (David Schwimmer), are spending a romantic week 
at a tropical island resort in the South Pacific.  Despite being on 
vacation, Robin, an assistant editor for DAZZLE magazine, is only a 
phone call away from her boss, and, when duty makes demands, she finds 
herself in need of a quick flight to Tahiti.  For $700, a local fly-by-
the-seat-of-his-pants pilot, Quinn Harris (Harrison Ford), agrees to 
leave behind his buxom playmate, Angelica (Jacqueline Obradors), and 
transport Robin to her destination.  However, it's not a smooth trip.  
Along the way, the duo encounter a storm, their plane is hit by 
lightning, and they crash land on a deserted island.  For the next 
twenty screen minutes, they pass the time by getting to know one 
another, tossing around sexual innuendoes, and starting to fall in love.  
Then the pirates sail into their verdant paradise.</P>
<P>     Led by ONCE WERE WARRIORS' Temura Morrison, these guys are big, 
bad, greedy, and stupid.  Their purpose is painfully evident -- they're 
on hand to add some action to the proceedings.  Who wants to spend 
ninety minutes watching Quinn and Robin grow closer over cozy peacock 
dinners?  So, instead, we get rubber raft chases, a foot race through a 
forest, and a fist fight.  All of this formulaic action isn't remotely 
exciting; the only thing it successfully accomplishes is padding out the 
running time so that the movie clocks in at a "reasonable" length.  </P>
<P>     The normally-laconic Harrison Ford shows more spunk here than in 
many of his recent outings.  This is an ego-feeding role:  Quinn not 
only gets the girl (who's about half his age) and saves the day, but he 
is also given the opportunity to engage in the kind of physical exertion 
that would kill many men 20 years his junior.  Anne Heche makes for a 
decent, if not superlative, romantic sparring partner.  She and Ford 
aren't exactly Hepburn and Tracy, but they trade barbs effectively and 
develop enough chemistry to keep us from going to sleep.  In supporting 
roles, David Schwimmer manages not to be painfully annoying and 
Jacqueline Obradors flaunts her obvious assets (which have nothing to do 
with acting talent).</P>
<P>     I suppose in this summer of moribund movies, it's possible to do a 
lot worse than SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS for light, escapist entertainment.  
Despite being a complete failure when it comes to action/adventure 
stuff, the movie is adequate as a romantic comedy.  And, while the 
screenplay isn't top-notch, it offers a few genuinely funny one-liners 
and a couple of scenes of surprisingly effective dialogue.  Ever since 
GHOSTBUSTERS, director Ivan Reitman has been a bankable name in 
Hollywood.  Sometimes, however, the on-screen talent he attracts for his 
movies is better than the material they're asked to work with.  SIX 
DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS, although not deserving to be numbered among 
Reitman's worst missteps, is a perfect example of this.</P>
