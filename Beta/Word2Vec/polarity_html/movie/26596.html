<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>There was a worm in the core of this turgid thriller that spoiled its
taste. The moody production of Smilla's Sense of Snow is adapted from
Peter Hoeg's best-seller. This is a film with so much unrealized
potential, about the icy heroine of the story, the tough-minded
half-American and half-Greenland Inuit, Smilla Jaspersen (Julia Ormond),
who seemingly stepped into a hole in the ice before the film's finale
and was ludicrously transformed from a captivating noir personality to a
typical Hollywood action heroine.</P>
<P>Smilla's Sense of Snow presents a mysterious story relying on tense
local atmosphere, enigmatic characters and twists in the plot, to spin
its dark tale of a heroine looking to find her roots again. The Danish
director, Bille August, who tries to be faithful to his fellow
countryman's source material, presents a glossy and sleek looking film
that inherits all the virtues and vices of the book, and comes up short
in the end because it cannot overcome how utterly ludicrous the story
becomes.</P>
<P>The film opens as a meteorite, in the Greenland of 1859, hits the ice
and crushes everyone in the vicinity, including an Inuit fisherman,
putting on a spectacular light show in the crushed ice, reminding me of
the pyrotechnics one would see at a July 4th celebration. The film then
switches to modern Coperhagen and the story involves the nefarious
dealings of a the Greenland Mining Company, whose secret research, which
turns out to be over parasitic worms coming to life from the fallen
meteor, becomes the crux of the mystery. But the personal story is about
Smilla being an Inuit living in a large modern city, using the boy's
death as an excuse to find out who she really is.</P>
<P>Smilla is a troubled young lady, never fitting into living in
Copenhagen, Denmark, where her father, an American doctor named Moritz
(Loggia), brought her after her mother was killed in a kayak accident
when she was six. She has remained detached from others in this
claustrophobic urbane setting ever since leaving the spaciousness of
Greenland, except she is drawn to a six year old deaf Inuit boy named
Isaiah (Clipper Miano) who lives in the same apartment building with his
alcoholic mother.</P>
<P>The mystery begins with Isaiah's puzzling death, which happens in the
film's beginning. The boy falls off the rooftop of his apartment
building and the only tracks on the snowy roof are his, as he heads
straight for the ledge. But Smilla questions the police that his death
is ruled accidental, as she notes the boy had a phobia about heights and
would never go up to the roof to play alone. She also relies on her
intuitions, as all her instincts tell her that Isaiah was murdered. As
she investigates the boy's death, writing a letter to the district
attorney to re-open the investigation and questions the medical doctor
who did the autopsy, and then becomes convinced she is right after
meeting with the mining company's secretary (Vanessa Redgrave), where
she learns from her of a secret company archive in the basement. She
even gets the unsolicited support of her nosy neighbor, who makes
friends with her and even becomes her lover. He is called the Mechanic
(Gabriel Byrne), someone whom she never quite trusts or knows what he
does for a living, but finds him useful as she finds that she is onto a
conspiracy, which puts her in danger and will eventually take her back
to her roots in Greenland.</P>
<P>Her investigation uncovers that the neglected boy's father died in a
mining explosion in Greenland, which resulted in the boy's recent
arrival to Denmark, where he is being examined by the mining company's
head doctor Professor Loyen (Tom Wilkinson), once every month, which
strikes her as being very strange.</P>
<P>What should strike the audience as even stranger is how the film ends up
in the same ice caves where the film opened up its story in the 19th
century. The last 30 minutes of this, until now, seemingly plausible
story, becomes unbelievable, as Smilla uses trickery to get herself on
board the Russian ship Kronos to Greenland. Aboard, she further
investigates the mystery of the boy's death by climbing inside a
dumbwaiter taking her to where the mystery passengers on ship reside,
where industrialist Andreas Tørk (Richard Harris), who is like one one
of those cartoonish James Bond movie villains, lusting for power, greed,
and fame, is confronted by our heroine who seeks only justice. This is
how one would do it in a formulaic Hollywood film, thereby putting a
damper on the terrific mood the film had just set. It was sort of like
going to dinner and getting a whiff of some sensual aromas and looking
at some appetizing food on display, but when getting down to the heart
of the meal with great anticipation, suddenly discovering the meal is
just not edible. If you can be satisfied with just the atmosphere and
not the story or any character being developed adequately, then you
might feel adequately nourished by what you saw. I wasn't. I was just
swept away by the moody setting, the fine stoic performance by Ormond,
and the potential for intrigue -- which, unfortunately, never
materialized as it could have.</P>
