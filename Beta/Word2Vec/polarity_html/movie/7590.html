<P>     Unemployment is a bane almost everyone can appreciate -- a=20
universal affliction that becomes a sobering reality for many people=20
during even the best of economic times.  And, while the loss of each=20
individual job is traumatic, that's nothing compared to what happens=20
when the livelihood and identity of an entire community are jeopardized=20
by a round of mass layoffs.  BRASSED OFF!, written and directed by Mark=20
Herman, takes a look at the plight of the British coal miner -- a dying=20
breed.  Once, mining was a thriving industry in rural England, with=20
whole towns built around each mine.  But, during the early 1980s, the=20
Tory government began converting the country to nuclear power.  The=20
resulting drop in demand devastated the coal industry, with hundreds of=20
pits being closed and a quarter of a million miners made "redundant." =20</P>
<P>     Grimley Colliery is a mine on the verge of shutting down.  The pit,=20
which employs more than 1000 miners, has been targeted for closure, but,=20
to sweeten the bitter taste for the workers, a healthy severance package=20
has been offered.  Still, there are those who are willing to fight to=20
the end, believing that no amount of money can make up for the damage=20
that Grimley's closure will bring.  Among the most vocal of the anti-
closing brigade are Andy (Ewan McGregor), a brash, young miner whose=20
lungs are still relatively clean, and Phil (Stephen Tompkinson), a=20
family man who's deep in debt and needs his job to make ends meet. =20
Meanwhile, Phil's father, Danny (Pete Postlethwaite), wants the mine to=20
stay open for a different reason.  He's the conductor of the Grimley=20
Colliery Brass Band (in fact, it's his life), and, if the mine closes,=20
the band will come to an end.  In fact, several members are considering=20
tendering their resignations to Danny when a pretty young trumpet=20
player, Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald), arrives in town and asks to sit in on=20
the practice sessions.</P>
<P>     BRASSED OFF! is a traditional feel-good motion picture with an=20
element of social commentary thrown in for good measure.  The film might=20
have been stronger had it displayed a little more anger throughout=20
instead of opting for a big speech at the end to get the point across,=20
but at least it imparts a measure of the pain that unemployment can=20
cause.  And BRASSED OFF! is less glib than Michael Moore's ROGER AND ME=20
in pursuing a similar aim.  While Moore's chief goal was a caustic=20
attack against General Motors, BRASSED OFF! shows the human toll of mass=20
layoffs.</P>
<P>     Even though two of the most prominent names in the cast are rising=20
stars Ewan McGregor (TRAINSPOTTING) and Tara Fitzgerald (THE ENGLISHMAN=20
WHO WENT UP A HILL=85), their performances are among the least noteworthy. =
=20
The best acting turn belongs to Pete Postlethwaite (IN THE NAME OF THE=20
FATHER), whose Danny is poignant and proud, followed closely by such=20
British stalwarts as Jim Carter, Philip Jackson, Peter Martin, and=20
Stephen Tompkinson.  If Danny represents BRASSED OFF!'s heart, then the=20
miners represent its body and soul. =20</P>
<P>     Actually, McGregor and Fitzgerald appear to be on hand largely to=20
inject some youthful appeal into the film.  Neither of their characters=20
is particularly necessary or effective.  However, without their rather=20
unconvincing romantic subplot, the movie probably wouldn't reach as wide=20
an audience.  They may not do much, but they're there, and their=20
characters fall in love.  That will be enough for certain viewers who=20
would otherwise ignore a dramatic comedy about a bunch of old geezers=20
who play in a colliery brass band.</P>
<P>     The plot itself is littered with familiar feel-good elements:  the=20
big competition, the critical illness of a key character (win one for=20
the Gipper!), and the redemption of someone who's viewed as a betrayer. =20
Despite this, or perhaps partially because of it, BRASSED OFF!=20
successfully presents its theme without ever becoming overbearing. =20
Certainly, this isn't a hard-hitting motion picture like GERMINAL, but=20
its heart is in the right place, it has a great soundtrack, and it keeps=20
the viewer entertained.  Anyone seeing BRASSED OFF! for its lighter,=20
less effective elements (the love story, the band competition) should at=20
least understand the message that Mark Herman is conveying.=20</P>
