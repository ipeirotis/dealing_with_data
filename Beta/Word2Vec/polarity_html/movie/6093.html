<PRE>                            THE RICH MAN'S WIFE
                       A film review by Ben Hoffman
                        Copyright 1996 Ben Hoffman</PRE>
<P>There has been very little worth seeing at the movies these
past couple of months.   Many of them look so much alike you would
have difficulty telling them apart.  I am talking about the gore, the
shooting, the psychos. . . the so-called "thriller."</P>
<P>In RICH MAN'S WIFE, Tony (Christopher McDonald) is "the rich
man."   Josie Potenza (the beautiful Halle Berry) is his wife whom he
neglects though it is hard to know why.   Instead he is deep into his
many business deals but finds time to be unfaithful.  When he gets
murdered, Josie is the natural suspect as she has the most to gain,
his wealth.  First she tells the police one story and then she
promises to tell the truth.  What are the cops to believe?
Josie turns to Jake (Clive Owen) for "comfort."  A bad move
as he is a friend of a psycho, Cole, (Peter Greene).  Cole wants not
only to have Josie but to also blackmail her.  Things get real
complicated but stay boring as the film has nothing new you have not
seen many times before.  Only the names are changed to protect the
innocent actors.</P>
<P>Halle Berry is beautiful and Peter Greene is slimy and
vicious.  It takes more than that to make a good movie.</P>
<P>Written and Directed by Amy Holden Jones</P>
