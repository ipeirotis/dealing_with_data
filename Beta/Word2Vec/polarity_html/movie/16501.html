<PRE>STILL CRAZY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>It was a sign from "the gods of Rock and Roll."  At an ancient Druid
circle where they were lamenting the death of Brian Lovell, their lead
guitarist, the members of the Strange Fruit band heard his music coming
over the hill.  At first they thought it was Brian, risen from the dead.
But then they saw a herd of sheep followed by a young shepherd carrying
a boom box on his shoulder.  Not many people played their music anymore,
so this had to be an omen.</P>
<P>Reunited for a twentieth-anniversary tour after years apart, the Strange
Fruit's last concert had quite a different heavenly encounter.  As they
played outdoors to a jam-packed crowd, their instruments were blown to
bits by "divine intervention" -- a lightning bolt struck nearby causing
a huge electrical surge.</P>
<P>Made by filmmakers with just the right credentials, director Brian
Gibson (WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT) and writers Dick Clement and Ian
La Frenais (THE COMMITMENTS), STILL CRAZY is a small, unpretentious
movie with a big-hearted story.</P>
<P>The Strange Fruit members went their separate ways years ago, but
they've been asked to come back together to play at a big twentieth
reunion concert.  They decide to play seedy clubs and small concert
halls, which they call "down and out venues," in order to prepare for
the big concert, which makes for a energetic ending to a delightful
movie.  Along the way, they have a blast reliving the good old times on
their tour bus.  And in this inviting movie, so will you.  Just kick
back and let the good times roll as the 70's music and the band's good
humor pumps up your day.</P>
<P>Each member of the cast has a sweet little story to tell.  As the
keyboard player, Tony Costello, Stephen Rea wears a tooth of Jimi
Hendrix around his neck.  A contraceptives distributor in Spain, he's
happy to give up his day job for a chance to relive old glory.</P>
<P>Juliet Aubrey plays Karen Knowles, the group's ex-gofer.  When we meet
her, she's wearing a standard issue coat and tie for her corporate
position as a business meeting organizer.  She quits in a flash to
rejoin her old buddies.</P>
<P>Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) leaves his roof repair job.  David 'Beano'
Baggot (Timothy Spall), who looks like a retired Hells Angel, abandons
his plant nursery position to rebuild the band.  MRS. BROWNS's Billy
Connolly plays Hughie, the tough looking, marshmallow of a guy who is
the band's driver and soundman.</P>
<P>With just this cast, the movie would have been enjoyable, but Bill
Nighy, as the band's troubled singer, Ray Simms, adds extra panache that
gives the movie its special ingredient.  Fond of long fur coats and
living in his mansion, Ray's a superrich guy.  Or is he?  His mansion is
up for sale and his finances are as low as his ego, which needs a lot of
stroking before he's up to singing in front of a crowd again.</P>
<P>Ray can't get used to his loss of fame.  When the pizza delivery guy
asks for his signature on the bill, Ray immediately signs it "Best
wishes to" and asks his name, while the guy looks back at him in
disbelief.  In order to muster the courage to perform, Ray practices in
front of the mirror uttering things like "take no prisoners" and
reciting the number of people in each city who attended their last big
concert tour.</P>
<P>"You know how old I am?" a despondent Ray asks Karen.  "How old?" she
replies.  "Old," he sighs simply.  Ray is an admitted alcoholic who's on
the wagon now.  He is so dedicated that he goes to AA meetings while on
tour.  The one in Holland proves problematic for him since it turns out
to be conducted in Dutch.</P>
<P>"The tragedy is that our lives peak too early," Ray complains.  The
movie argues convincingly that we do not have to accept this
conventional wisdom.  The upbeat film doesn't really care if we ponder
these little messages; it is happy just to entertain us by letting us
hang out with the band and vicariously enjoy their gigs.</P>
<P>STILL CRAZY runs a fast 1:35.  It is rated R for modest amounts of
profanity, sexuality and drug usage and would be fine for most
teenagers.</P>
