<PRE>HAPPINESS
A film review by Matt Williams</PRE>
<PRE>RATING: * * out of * * * *</PRE>
<P>Don't be fooled by the title.  There is happiness in Todd Solondz'
latest film, but it's not exactly what you would expect.  The film
explores several unhappy (and, in some cases, extremely dysfunctional)
people in their quest to find "happiness", wherever they can. Sometimes,
it is in the oddest and most unusual depths.</P>
<P>The film centers on the lives of three dysfunctional sisters, and the
dysfunctional people around them.  First of all, there's Joy (Jane
Adams), who starts out the movie with a painful breakup with her latest
loser boyfriend (Jon Lovitz).</P>
<P>Joy's sister, Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), is an outwardly successful
woman, beautiful and intelligent.  That's probably what attracts the
attention of her neighbor, Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the obscene
phone caller next door.</P>
<P>And finally, there's Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), a naive housewife
married to Allen's therapist, Bill (Dylan Baker).  Bill has his own
problems:  he's a compulsive pedophile serial rapist.  But, he still
tries to be a good dad to his son, while lusting after his son's young
friends.  And these are just a few of the sympathetic characters you'll
meet in Happiness.</P>
<P>A problem with Happiness is often a problem in ensemble stories like
this.  Some of the plotlines are considerably less interesting than the
others.  A good ensemble work needs balance...Happiness just seems
desperately uneven.</P>
<P>Surprisingly (or, well, maybe not that surprisingly) the film's most
disturbing characters are also its most interesting.  Heading out the
pack is Dylan Baker's serial rapist.  He's certainly not the type of guy
you'd want to spend too much time with, but he's fascinating to
watch...there certainly hasn't been another character quite like this
one before.  And then there's the insecure Allen, wonderfully played by
Philip Seymour Hoffman, who's so pathetic he's alternately frightening
and endearing.</P>
<P>In comparison, plotlines like the romantic travails of Joy, or the
separation of the sisters' parents seem hopelessly conventional and
bland.  The film establishes its own peculiar rhythm, but then
constantly loses it every time it trudges back to the mundane.</P>
<P>That said, even the interesting characters and plotlines here aren't for
everyone (if you couldn't tell just by the descriptions). Happiness is a
film that revels in depravity, and is definitely not a movie for the
easily offended (and perhaps many of the not-so-easily offended).</P>
<P>The movie is X-Mozilla-Status: 0009 treats.  Some are quite good, some
are quite bad, but you can be assured that you've never seen an
assortment quite like this before.</P>
