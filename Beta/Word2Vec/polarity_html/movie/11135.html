<P>     DANGEROUS BEAUTY is a lavish historical melodrama that has enough 
suds, sex, and flashes of flesh to appeal to soap opera-lovers and 
enough substance to attract those of a more intellectual bent.  However, 
while the movie does more than pay lip service to themes of female 
empowerment and religious intolerance, the main focus is the kind of 
hopeless, star-crossed romance that gave WINGS OF THE DOVE flight.  How 
do two young lovers, separated on their social terrain by a gulf of 
wealth and power, reconcile the hot reality of their passion with the 
cold truth that they can never marry? </P>
<P>     DANGEROUS BEAUTY came into being using the title THE HONEST 
COURTESAN (which is also the name of Margaret Rosenthal's "true story" 
novel, upon which the film is based).  That appellation was dropped for 
fear that audiences wouldn't know what it meant.  However, not only is 
THE HONEST COURTESAN a more apt title, but it's a more provocative one.  
The words "dangerous beauty" mean very little, especially in connection 
with this film.  In fact, a name like this sounds more apropos for a 
soft-core exploitation flick than a sumptuous tale of late-16th century 
Venice.</P>
<P>     The time of DANGEROUS BEAUTY is the era in which Shakespeare lived 
and thrived, and the region of the world in which this story transpires 
was one of the Bard's favorite locales.  As in many of Shakespeare's 
plays, the film makers have elected to have English-speaking actors play 
Italian characters.  What's more, there are no silly accents.  And, 
although the dialogue sounds more contemporary than archaic, the 
costumes, set design, and attitudes of the characters serve as powerful 
reminders that this is an historical tale.</P>
<P>     In 1583 Venice, women were regarded as little more than 
possessions.  Education and willfulness were negative traits, reserved 
only for those who plied their bodies for money.  Marriage had nothing 
to do with love -- it was a contract made based exclusively on 
considerations of wealth and position.  If a girl's family didn't have 
money, she had no hope of marrying an "important" man, no matter how 
deeply the two loved each other.  In a situation like that, if she 
wanted him, her only hope was to become his mistress.  And, if she was 
truly ambitious and skilled, she could become a courtesan, a mistress to 
dozens of men, all willing to pay for her services.</P>
<P>     Such are the circumstances of Veronica Franco (Catherine 
McCormack), who is desperately smitten with Marco Vernier (Rufus Sewell) 
-- and he with her.  But the difference in their social position makes a 
legal relationship impossible.  When Marco, not wanting to lead Veronica 
on, informs her of this harsh truth, she is devastated, and chooses to 
follow the advice of her mother (Jacqueline Bisset) and become a 
courtesan.  Soon, with her rare mix of beauty, intelligence, and wit, 
she is the most prized prostitute in Venice, desired by everyone from 
the local bishop to the King of France.  But, during the age of the 
Spanish Inquisition, power gained through "sinful" means can be a 
tenuous thing.</P>
<P>     Against the backdrop of Veronica and Marco's tumultuous 
relationship, director Marshall Herskovitz explores the injustices 
visited upon women at a time when they were universally viewed as 
inferior to men.  The obedient wives are presented as timid, uncertain 
creatures who dream of a better lot for their daughters while secretly 
envying Veronica's freedom.  For her part, although Veronica uses every 
weapon at her disposal to hold her own in power struggles with men, she 
would give all that she has away for a life with Marco. </P>
<P>     Catherine McCormack (who played Mel Gibson's lover in BRAVEHEART) 
is perfectly cast as Veronica.  The actress has a wonderfully expressive 
face and is capable of flowing effortlessly from an almost-comic 
portrayal to a more serious one.  Added to that, she shows a flash of 
Errol Flynn.  During the course of DANGEROUS BEAUTY, McCormack is given 
several opportunities to become involved in duels where the weapons vary 
from poetry to rapiers.  Playing opposite her, Rufus Sewell (COLD 
COMFORT FARM, HAMLET) displays both confidence and sensitivity, which 
makes him the ideal romantic lead.  It doesn't hurt that he and 
McCormack ignite a few sparks when they're together.</P>
<P>     One of DANGEROUS BEAUTY's subtle treasures is the top-notch 
supporting cast.  Jacqueline Bisset is calm and tranquil as Veronica's 
mother, who was once a famous courtesan.  Fred Ward shows real depth as 
Marco's uncle, who understands his nephew's longing for the seductive 
temptress.  And Moira Kelly (as Marco's sister, Beatrice), despite being 
relegated to the background for most of the film, has one scene of 
startling, unbridled vehemence when she launches into a bitter diatribe 
about the fate of women in a world that treats them with so little 
value.</P>
<P>     The actors, like the story, are helped immeasurably by the film's 
look.  Visually, this is a gorgeous motion picture.  Cinematographer 
Bojan Bazelli's camera loves the streets and canals of Venice, making 
the city as much a character as any of the people.  Filters only enhance 
the beauty.  Using Bazelli's photography as a catalyst, Herskovitz 
creates the perfect tone -- one that is often serious, but occasionally 
playful, and where serenity can be suddenly interrupted by a burst of 
passion.</P>
<P>     As is the case with too many melodramas designed to give the 
audience a triumphant rush, DANGEROUS BEAUTY goes over the top in its 
closing moments, offering speech-making and grandstanding that undercuts 
some of the film's drama.  Still, it's hard to argue that, contrived as 
it may be, there's something satisfying about the way things wrap up.  A 
"commercial" finale isn't the worst thing that could happen in a picture 
like this -- it may be emotionally manipulative, but, on a certain 
level, it works.  DANGEROUS BEAUTY isn't great art, but it is good 
entertainment.</P>
