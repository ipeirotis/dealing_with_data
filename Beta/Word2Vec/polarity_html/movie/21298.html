<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A realistic, hard-boiled peek at an old Irish, close-knit neighborhood,
in Boston's blue-collar Charlestown section. The neighborhood is
beginning to change a bit with "yuppies" moving in nearby; and, then,
there is the more dangerous threat to them of blacks possibly moving in.
This is upsetting to these insulated residents, fearful of what they
don't and can't understand. The focus of the film, is on Bobby O'Grady
(Denis), who is living with his mum, while being unemployed and hanging
out with Mousey (Ian) and his cousin from Dublin, Jason (Seamus), and
his other bar cohorts. They steal cars for the local crime boss of the
area, known as Jackie O (Colm), who tightly controls the neighborhood
with a menacing friendliness. Jackie O strictly enforces the code of the
neighborhood, making sure that no one squeals to the cops. His motto is:
"loyalty is what counts the most."</P>
<P>What makes this over-used type of storyline for many recent films, stand
out from the rest, is that there is no mistake, this is the actual
mentality of the neighborhood. The film is seen through the eyes of
Bobby, the film's low-life protagonist. We are stuck with him, perhaps,
to a certain extent even commiserating with him, seeing that he can't
escape from being born into a life of crime, even if he has a good mum
and doesn't appear to be a really bad sort of a person, just a little
wild and rough in spots. His main problem seems to be that he has no one
around to point him in the right direction. The one person, Jason, whom
he could talk to, he can't, because Jason could only express his anguish
that things are rotten over here and he does not find Bobby to be
receptive to what he says about altering his behavior. That is the deep
sadness about the film, it traps everyone into its malaise, and we feel
that there can be no getting out of the neighborhood or the criminal
ways these street people cling to.</P>
<PRE>It all seems so pointless.</PRE>
<P>When Jackie O starts rubbing out those close to Bobby, just on the
perception that they might have said something to the police, Bobby
starts a slow boil. He is unable to think straight about what he should
do; but, breaking the code of silence is never one of his options.
Thrown into the mix, is a sexy neighborhood girl, who is a bit of a
head-case herself, Katy (Famke). She is Jackie O's girl, but is seeing
Bobby on the side; and, is extremely jealous if Bobby goes after any
other girl. This is evident in the scene that really summarizes the
direction the story is going, when Bobby, out of frustration, at seeing
Jackie O and Katy together at the local bar they hang out in, decides to
pick-up an attractive yuppie, Annie (Jeanne). She came into the local
bar out of curiosity. This pick-up does not go well, and he is rejected
by her. Then the most annoying and daring scene in the film takes place,
as he goes riding with his pals, and they spot a black man in their
neighborhood, and even though nothing comes of this, as far as going
through with the actual violence they threaten him with, but the overt
violence and hatred shown to this outsider, clearly shows how narrow
their lives are. This incident becomes transfixed on our protagonist
forever, forewarning us, that there is no way out for him.</P>
<P>MONUMENT AVE. works well as a potently atmospheric film, that captures
the mood of a neighborhood but cannot penetrate the souls of the
individuals who live there. The boundary line from yuppieville to
blue-collarville, is Monument Ave., and our boy can't cross the boundary
line; that is, without being thieves.</P>
<P>There is a prevailing  emptiness in their lives. When they have inane
conversations about movie stars' tits and their frivolous neighborhood
adventures, while snorting coke and getting boozed up, it all seems to
be a tragically wasteful way of life. Even with all their bravado, they
feel and act like losers. The Irish cop Hanlon (Sheen) knows them as
well as any outsider really can, having grown up in the "hood," even
though, he now lives in the more affluent suburbs. He knows them from
his dealings with them, that their code of silence is all that one can
expect from them.</P>
<P>The power of the story has stalled out somewhere in the midst of all the
turbulence in the young men' lives, leaving them with no place to go
after all the cursing and shooting pauses for a break. As the message is
simply, that nothing changes here. If you don't go along with the way
things are done by the crime bosses, your only other choice is a
dead-end job.</P>
<P>Bobby has this anguished look on his face, as he does what he has to do
and is as successful as he will ever be in his lifetime after he settles
his old debts the only way he knows how to; and, his friends drink a
toast to him, and the inane bar conversation mixes in with the bar
music, as the picture fades out on this insightful but unfulfilling
film.</P>
