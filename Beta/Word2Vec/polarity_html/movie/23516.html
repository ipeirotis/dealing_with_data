<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>D.W. Griffith, always the showman, set out to make an epic from a small
story about sisters in trouble. He changed the story based on Adolphe d'
Ennery's 19th century play "The Two Orphans," by adding on the
historical events of the French Revolution and making that a major part
of the story, while keeping the gist of the original story intact. He
cast for this melodrama, his favorite actress, Lillian Gish, and had her
sister Dorothy to play the other sister. This was the last feature
Lillian would work with the director, having become such a big box
office star he urged her to take the money the big studios could afford
to pay her, which he couldn't. Lillian worked until she was 88,
co-starring in The Whales Of August (87). Orphans was also Dorothy's
last role with the director, like her sister, she signed with Henry
King's Inspiration Pictures, even working in the same film again with
her sister in Romola (1925).</P>
<P>The Charles Dickens influence is evident on Griffith's work, as the
complications to this simple plot keeps getting more involved in the
political trials of the Revolutionary times. It also gave the director a
chance to pontificate against the more current Bolshevic Revolution of
1917. At one point in the film he states: "The tyranny of kings and
nobles is hard to bear, but the tyranny of the maddened mob under
blood-lusting rulers is intolerable and others that stab at anarchy and
bolshevism."</P>
<P>Interestingly enough, it was filmed in the studio located on 14 acres at
Mamaroneck, New York.</P>
<P>The popularity of the play inspired at least one French and three
American film adaptations. It's not a film without major faults, which
include stilted acting, clumsy characterizations, an implausible tale,
and laughable melodrama. But somehow the well-intentioned sincerity of
the story plows its way through the mess and the film is interesting as
both a museum curio and for the raw emotions expressed by the suffering
sisters. It is also noted for its rough characterization of Robespierre,
its beautiful costumes and authentic looking mob scenes, capturing the
chaos of the times. But it still should prove to be of interest mainly
to film buffs rather than the general public.</P>
<P>It is the story of a baby from a wealthy family, named Louise (Dorothy
Gish), who is left on the doorstep of a poor couple, who have a daughter
named Henriette (Lillian Gish). The two girls are deeply attached to one
another and become as close as sisters. Their parents die in the plague
and Louise later on becomes blind. Henriette swears she will take care
of her sister and be her eyes. They decide to leave their country place
and come to Paris by coach in the hopes of seeing a doctor to cure
Louise's blindness.</P>
<P>They tragically get separated as a lascivious aristocrat (Wallace)
separates the sisters by kidnaping Henriette; he is lustfully attracted
to her because of her virgin looks. He brings her to his ball and plans
to have an orgy with her, figuring he won't get punished because of his
noble rank and her common one. At the ball, Chevalier de Vaudrey
(Schildkraut), a young nobleman of one France's most distinguished
families, comes to her rescue and fights a duel with the malevolent
aristocrat to free the girl.</P>
<P>When Henriette returns with Chevalier to the spot of the kidnapping, her
sister is not there. Louise was taken into a family of cruel thieves and
forced to work for them as a beggar. Mother Frochard (Lucille La Verne)
and her two sons, the cowardly Pierre (Frank Puglia) and the wicked
Jacques (Sheldon Lewis), who force her out in the snow to beg. A doctor
sees her begging and tells the one he takes to be her mother, Frochard,
that he can cure her, but she refuses to tell this to Louise so that she
can continue begging. One day when Louise is forced to beg by singing,
she meets her sister, who sees her from the balcony of her apartment.
But Henriette is being arrested by the police on a complaint by
Chevalier's father. He does not approve of his son's plans to marry this
commoner, especially when the King has chosen a suitable noble lady for
him to marry. As a result, Henriette is placed in a prison for fallen
women.</P>
<P>On the day the Bastille falls, as the revolution begins, Henriette is
freed and returns to her apartment. Chevalier who was exiled to the
country by his father, to keep him away from the commoner, returns to
her disguised as a commoner, but is recognized by someone who is now a
judge for the Reign of Terror and who seeks vengeance against the
nobleman's family because of how they tortured his father,
Jacques-Forget-Not (Leslie King).</P>
<P>The couple is sentenced to die by the guillotine, only to have Danton
(Blue), one of the leaders of the revolution, a great orator, a friend
of the masses, who Henriette befriended in a time of need for him, come
to the tribunal and plead for mercy for the two. It also shows
Robespierre (Herbert) as a cowardly leader (he is called a
pussy-footer), who was bloodthirsty to purge France of all vice. He was
someone who believed that if you didn't think like him, you were evil.
Tearfully the sisters meet at the trial, as Louise is rescued by Pierre,
who has a knife fight with his brother to free her. There is a glorious
last minute rescue of the couple, a tearful reuniting of the sisters,
and a happy ending, as Louise gets her eyesight back after her
operation.</P>
<P>The excessively melodramatic story is one that tugs at the heart
strings, but makes up for so much goo by conveying Griffith's history
lesson: that the French Revolutionists rightly overthrew a bad
government, but unfortunately allowed dictatorial mob rule to take over.
He said it was similar to what happened when the Communists came to
power in Russia after their 1917 revolution. How the film works for you,
depends on what you can overlook about it that is creaky and what you
can accept about it that is grandiose. It has not aged well, but I found
it worth seeing for its historical value and its chilling suspense. For
whatever the director's faults were, as for his politics being tainted
with contradictions, he, at least, always considered his art above all
else. It is filmed in a pleasant to look at tinted B/W.</P>
