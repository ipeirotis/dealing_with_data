<P>     WILD THINGS is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring 
day… provided, of course, that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy.  
There is, in fact, no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at:  
movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative 
target group.  This is film noir for the MTV generation:  fast-paced, 
slick, flashy, gleefully mindless, and hollow to the core.  WILD THINGS 
is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during 
the first eleven weeks of 1998.  I've seen more convincing drama (with 
nearly as much bare flesh) on that pinnacle of narrative quality, 
BAYWATCH.  </P>
<P>     WILD THINGS wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller 
with a real story.  What it is, however, is a series of increasingly-
improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists.  Everything in 
between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast, a 
spatter of blood, and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a 
Steven Seagal movie.  The film tries so hard to surprise its audience 
that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the 
most unlikely thing to happen, and that will probably be it.  Using this 
approach, I was right three times and wrong only once.  That's not a 
good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark 
about what's around the next corner.</P>
<P>     The ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie:  the hot, young 
cast and the old standby, sex.  Both have an abundance of screen time, 
although I'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less 
impressive than I expected.  Nothing about WILD THINGS is exceptionally 
risqué.  The soft-core sex sequences are generic, and don't generate 
much heat.  The lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in BOUND.  
Theresa Russell and Denise Richards have only token topless appearances 
(Neve Campbell, possessing an iron-clad "no nudity" clause in her 
contract, keeps her clothes more or less on).  The film's greatest 
curiosity is a full frontal shot of Kevin Bacon climbing out of the 
shower.  Maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed Leonardo 
DiCaprio for the thirteenth time in TITANIC to catch a glimpse of what 
Kyra Sedgwick (Mrs. Kevin Bacon) is familiar with.  </P>
<P>     The director of WILD THINGS is John McNaughton, whose last effort 
was the finely-tuned psychological thriller, NORMAL LIFE.  That movie 
featured copious sex, a pair of real characters, and a powerful script.  
It's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from 
the same film maker.  But I suppose we all need to put food on the 
table.  McNaughton appears to have completely lost his way here, in what 
is obviously a stab at mainstream success (his previous wide-release 
picture, MAD DOG AND GLORY, was a box-office disappointment).  Quick 
cuts and pretty sunrises can't even begin to cover up this movie's 
flaws.</P>
<P>     The main character (and I use that term lightly, since no one in 
WILD THINGS shows more than an occasional flash of personality) is Sam 
Lombardo (Matt Dillon), a guidance counselor at Florida's Blue Bay High 
School.  A student, the deliciously curvaceous Kelly Van Ryan (Denise 
Richards), has a crush on him.  One afternoon, she comes to his house to 
wash his car, and, when she leaves, her clothing is torn.  After 
confessing to her mother (Theresa Russell) that she was raped, she goes 
to the police station, where she tells her story to detectives Ray 
Duquette (Kevin Bacon) and Gloria Perez (Daphne Rubin-Vega).  They are 
skeptical about here claims until another girl, Suzie Toller (Neve 
Campbell), comes forward with a similar tale.  Meanwhile, Sam, convinced 
that he's being set up, goes to a shyster lawyer (Bill Murray) for help.</P>
<P>     The acting in WILD THINGS isn't very good, but none of the 
principals have much to work with. This is definitely not a character-
based motion picture.  Not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the 
possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit I.Q., 
but it doesn't bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a 
hint of depth.  The men and women populating the picture are there to 
look nice, but nothing more.  Matt Dillon is given plenty of 
opportunities to flex his biceps.  Neve Campbell gets to model the 
slutty look.  Denise Richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through, 
one-piece bathing suit.  And nothing in the film gets a rise out of 
Kevin Bacon.  The only one who's even remotely interesting is Bill 
Murray, and he seems to think he's in comedy, not a thriller (maybe he's 
got the right idea).</P>
<P>     Columbia Pictures has specifically requested that critics not 
reveal the film's ending, which prompts the question:  which ending do 
they want kept secret?  WILD THINGS has no less than three (one occurs 
during the end credits, so stay seated), all of which are jaw-droppingly 
absurd -- a feat that Joe Eszterhas (the writer of BASIC INSTINCT and 
SHOWGIRLS) would be impressed by.  Thanks to Jeffrey Kimball's polished, 
kinetic cinematography, WILD THINGS always looks great, and George S. 
Clinton's score keeps it pulsing and throbbing.  But, no matter how 
shiny the superficial sheen is, this is still trash, and, like all 
garbage, it stinks.  </P>
