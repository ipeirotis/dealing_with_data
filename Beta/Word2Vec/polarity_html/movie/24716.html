<P>Rated PG-13 for mild language, adult situations, drug use, martial art
action and violence.  107 minutes.  Super 35mm / Panavision (2.35:1)<HR>What can you say about Jackie Chan that hasn't already been said.
Since the release of 'Rumble in the Bronx" back in 1996 (the U.S.
release), Jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on
America's video shelves. Having made over 80 films, Jackie has finally
succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the West. His
latest release, "Shanghai Noon", is a joyful tribute / spoof of the
classic Western. And by adding Jackie Chan into the genre, the tag
line for the film ("The Western gets a kick in the pants") rings true.</P>
<P>Jackie stars as Chon Wang, a lesser Imperial Guard in the Forbidden
City of China. The royal Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is set to be
married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture.
Unwilling to follow her Father's wishes, Princess Pei Pei with the
assistance of her English tutor, decides to escape to America. But
this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard Lo Fong, which will lead to
the Princess' kidnapping and ransom.</P>
<P>Unable to take any legal action, the ransom demands are met and three
of the Forbidden City's bravest Guards (played by Cui Ya Hi, Rong
Guang Yu, and Eric Chen) are ordered to transport the ransom payment
to Lo Fong in Carson City, Nevada. Chon Wang pleads with the imperial
court and is given permission to join the team, as he is looked upon
as a buffoon.</P>
<P>On a train in the U.S. Jackie meets up with bandit Roy O'Bannon (Owen
Wilson). He is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog, looking
simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him.
With his gang in tow, Roy attempts to rob the train, when one of his
gang murders the Chinese interpreter of the Royal Court, who also
happens to be Chon Wang's uncle.</P>
<P>Chon Wang gives chase, foiling the attempted robbery, but also leaving
himself stranded in the desert. As the disgraced Guard wanders through
the desert, he again comes upon Roy, who has been left for dead by his
former gang. Buried up to his neck in the desert, Roy pleads with Chon
to dig him out. Chon demands to know where Carson City is. Roy directs
him, and Chon leaves. But not before sticking two chopsticks into
Roy's mouth and telling him to dig himself.</P>
<P>Chon soon finds himself confronted by angry Crow warriors, a friendly
Sioux tribe, gunslingers, a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog
and an Indian bride (Brandon Merrill), before once again running into
Roy.</P>
<P>"Shanghai Noon" is just good fun. The chemistry between the cast is
remarkable. The performances are all acceptable within the whimsical
levels of the film. Jackie's performance is as good as anything he's
done before. He's not called on to do much acting here, as the
character is not written with any depth. But Jackie's natural charisma
shines through, and his comic timing is so perfect, both physically
and (surprise) verbally that once again he commands the screen
whenever he is on.</P>
<P>Owen Wilson, last seen in the embarrassing remake of "The Haunting",
gives a good natured performance as Roy O'Bannon. His innocence is
refreshing and fun. A bad guy that's not really bad. His scenes with
Jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since Martin and
Lewis. Lucy Liu as Princess Pei Pei is given little to do in the
script, but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other
deviant. The character is a noble woman of status and wealth, but
finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment.</P>
<P>The rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances.
Nothing here is realistic, mind you. "Shanghai Noon" is first and
foremost a light, jovial film. And the performances match that style
with ease.</P>
<P>The Cinematography by Dan Mindel is gorgeous. Using Calgary, Alberta
as the prime location. Mr. Mindel is able to create a lush, romantic
western feel to the film. Nothing here really looks like Nevada, but
the locations are so beautifully shot and staged, the film can be
looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre. And as
such, the script by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar plays fast and loose
with history, but with reverence to past films. Homage to such films
as "High Noon" (obviously), "Red River" and most notably "Butch
Cassidy & the Sundance Kid" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the
film. It is a comforting experience. At a time when the Western is
considered either old hat or irrelevant, here is a film that embraces
those old attitudes and (dare I say) clichés and manages to make them
palatable and refreshing. Here is a film that is not contemptuous of
the genre. This is the purest "horse opera" since the days of George
O'Brian or John Wayne.</P>
<P>Director Tom Dey has crafted a loving tribute to Hollywood's past. In
this, his first film Mr. Dey shows both a love of character and of
craftsmanship that is refreshing to see. Nothing here really stands
out, or takes one's attention away from the story or action. And that
is as it should be, when Jackie Chan is your star.</P>
<P>And what of the action and stunts. Well, while not up to a level of
"Drunken Master 2" or any of Jackie's Hong Kong films, "Shanghai Noon"
is miles ahead of anything Jackie has done in an American film before.
His timing, choreography, and creativity are still as sharp as ever.
Jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films
(obvious to those of us that have seen those films, but refreshingly
fun for those unfamiliar). Finally Jackie can honestly say, that he
has made an U.S., his way and incorporating his style.</P>
<P>To sum up, "Shanghai Noon" is a fun summer confection. Not too heavy
and not too light. A fun and entertaining film that the whole family
can enjoy (parents be advised there are scenes of smoking, drunkenness
and peyote use). An enjoyable and charming film that can and will be
enjoyed again and again.</P>
