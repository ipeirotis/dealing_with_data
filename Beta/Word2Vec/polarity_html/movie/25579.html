<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>One of the really haunting films of the 1990s. A film about a life
hitting a wall and taking the starch out of a young person's sense of
being. It is so painful to see what existence means and doesn't mean to
a teenage girl, that it is hard to look at this film without thinking of
it as a documentary. Its underlying theme is about the impossibility of
leading a moral life and being moral, that no matter what one does,
existence supercedes everything else. This unusually bleak look at the
desperation of a young girl's life won top prize, the Palme d'or, at the
prestigious Cannes Film Festival. Emilie Dequenne, the 18-year-old star,
shared the best-actress award. She played the role with conviction and
gave a truly unforgettable performance.</P>
<P>The Dardenne brothers have made an urgent film about today's job market
that hits home on its universal pathos and how those on the bottom are
taken advantage of by unfair employment practices. The film tells of how
a young girl can't manuever out of the poverty she was born into. It's a
theme that forces you to look at the young girl in an introspective way
and at her poverty as something that is real and not something that can
be dismissed by other distractions in the story. Rosetta's life is more
reflective of how ordinary Americans manage to scrape by and actually
exist, than in all the ludicrous themes of the escape films most
Americans flock to see. This film is rich in all the things about life
that Hollywood chooses to gloss over in its need to get a blockbuster
film. Its star does not exude beauty and is not faced with episodic
adventures. It is the triviality of her life, watching her everyday
movements, as she changes her shoes, cuts her French toast, sells her
old clothes to get money, skirts the traffic as she crosses a highway,
which gives this film its realistic flavor.</P>
<P>Rosetta (Emilie Dequenne) lives in a trailer park with her alcoholic
mother (Anne Yernaux). She angrily comes home after being fired from her
job at a factory, even though she considers herself to be a good worker.
No reason is given why she is laid off, but it upsets her so much that
she lashes out at her boss and has to be restrained by the police. We
follow her strident movements as she takes a bus home and then crosses a
highway to a wooded area where she removes a rock from a hole in the
ground and takes off her work shoes and replaces them with boots she
keeps in the hole. Her trailer is just outside some unnamed small town.
At home, she accuses her mother of getting drinks from another trailer
park resident, saying that he only gets her drunk to fuck her. A
hand-held camera is steadily focused on the young heroine and follows
her around as she goes fishing in a muddy creek near-by and uses a
hair-dryer blower over her belly to relieve her hunger pains before
going to sleep. Her life is an unusually lonely one for a teen-ager, and
she has no adult to help her shape her life.</P>
<P>A young man, probably the same age she is, Riquet (Fabrizio Rongione),
with romantic designs on her, who works at a Belgian waffle wagon stand,
comes by her trailer park by motorcycle, as her first reaction upon
seeing him, is to angrily knock him off the bike. But as they wrestle in
the ground, he tells her, "There's a job available, my boss fired
someone."</P>
<P>Her way of seeing things has become so chilling, that she never allows
herself to loosen up and welcome the young man's attention, regarding
him only as a rival for a job she wants. She goes to Riquet's place for
French toast and a beer, and cracks a smile for the first and only time
during the film, as he tries to show off doing some gymnastics and
clumsily falls. After she is fired from this job of making waffles
because the boss's idiot son returns to work, Riquet visits her and
falls in the muddy creek trying to retrieve her fishing line and is
sinking in the mud, and she thinks of letting him drown in order to get
his job, but reluctantly saves him. When he offers her a job
moonlighting, a scam he is working on the boss (Gourmet), selling
waffles he makes on his own, she turns him down, telling him she wants
only a regular job. Then she does something that many would consider
reprehensible though morally correct, she drops a dime on him and tells
the boss of his swindle. The boss immediately fires him and hires her.</P>
<P>The Dardennes (La Promesse) are veteran documentary filmmakers of
leftist leanings, with a penchant for making films about social
problems. They have created a masterfully perfect visceral film, that is
unflinching in its realism and unsentimental in its study of her. What
makes this film so uncompromising and ironical, is that we are not asked
to like or even accept Rosetta, we are only allowed to understand that
she does what she has to in order to exist. Isn't that the way life
really is, anyway?</P>
<P>It is difficult to remove from one's memory Rosetta's prayers for
normalcy, uttered to the invisible person she pictures herself sleeping
next to, as she goes to sleep, telling herself
"Your name is Rosetta, my name is Rosetta. I found a job, you got a job.
I got a friend, you got a friend. I will not fall in a rut, you will not
fall in a rut. I will lead a normal life, you will lead a normal life.
Good night, good night." This is the study of someone desperately trying
to become the somebody she pictures for herself. In many ways, her story
is ours, there are no national borders to separate us from such agony.</P>
<P>This film seems to give up on everyone but the struggle of Rosetta,
fully focusing on her point of view, of her life and death struggle, one
that must strike at the heart of society that allows such employment
injustices to exist without doing something to correct things (as a
result of this film, the Belgian government did pass a more favorable
labor law, which it called "Rosetta's Law"). There is nothing more
important for most people in the world than in securing a job, and there
are very few films that take the pains to show that getting a job is so
serious a matter. I think that the film critics who downplayed this film
into the minor category because of its lack of action and tedium, missed
a chance to see a film that had much more to offer than the usual type
of escapist entertainment fare. This film has the distinction of being
troublingly unique, it is devoid of any philosophy, it is even different
from Bresson's "Mouchette," a masterful film it is most closely akin to.
Bresson had too many religious and Catholic agendas in his film to
achieve the starkness this film does. This is a film made for purists of
the cinema, those who don't want to see another disposable film, but who
wish to see a film that is unmistakably direct, a film that they can see
themselves in if they are not too calloused and frightened of life to
look at the dark side. It is society's mistake if they make someone like
Rosetta invisible, and it is our mistake as filmgoers and critics if we
ignore films just because they bring up unpleasant subjects and we don't
feel entertained by them. To be so prosaic in our viewing habits as
that, we would be on the same slippery footing as Rosetta, striving for
the same kind of ridiculous normalcy she was after.</P>
