<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a quintessential John Ford Western. There are all his stock
characters present, the rousing song to stir one's heart is there as the
cavalry troops ride by with Stan Jones singing  'I Left My Love,' there
is the formula story of the men in order to be respected  proving
themselves in combat, and finally the film has Ford's ongoing patriotic
message that this country is for everyone who has the guts to fight for
it.</P>
<P>Harold Sinclair's novel is based on this actual Civil War mission. The
film proves more interesting than its predictable outcome because of
Ford's odd touches in certain scenes and John Wayne, who is who he is,
giving the film a powerful symbol. In one such scene, the
pacifist-leaning surgeon Major Kendall (William Holden) and the gung-ho,
company commander, Colonel Marlowe (John Wayne), argue about what comes
first, humanitarian treatment or one's army duty, as after the outfit's
first squirmish, Kendall stops in a Negro cabin to deliver a child and
receives an order from Marlowe not to, saying the mission is the most
important thing. It is a fundamental argument that has plagued mankind
about war ever since the beginning of time, that is, what is the right
way to fight a good war when the object is to kill the enemy. The scene
also had a white Union soldier dying and a Negro child being born into
freedom with the help of the army doctor, symbolic of the war's effort
to be for a good cause.</P>
<P>The plot of the film is set in 1863, as the practical-minded Colonel
Marlowe is ordered by General Sherman to take a cavalry brigade 300
miles into enemy territory and destroy the railroad depot and all the
tracks between Newton Station and Vicksburg cutting off supplies to the
South. There is no plan made for how they are to return to friendly
territory, except they should incur as few casualties as possible.</P>
<P>Ford is more interested in the characters in the story than the story
itself. The characters are all familiar ones: the new Sergeant Major
Kirby (Judson Pratt) likes to drink but is a good fighter, which makes
him acceptable in Ford's eyes. Col. Phil Secord (Willis B. Bouchey) is a
politician in civilian life, with designs on using his army record to
help him get elected as a congressman back in Michigan. Ford doesn't
like politicians, they are too willing to compromise their principles.
Secord does his job but is too ambitious and sleazy to be thought of as
a hero. The heroes are Colonel Marlowe, a railroad engineer in civilian
life, who is asked in his military life to destroy what he builds in
civilian life. Marlowe is a bitter man, unhappy that his wife was
unsuccessfully operated on by two doctors, leaving him with only
memories of her and a deep hatred for doctors. But there is no question
of his ability to lead and his bravery in combat, and as hard-boiled as
he is, there will be the scene that shows he is a just man. Kendall is
an equally obstinate man, a medical man who is dedicated to saving lives
and is willing to stand up to his superior to fight for what he believes
in. He will also prove himself in battle as someone who is a dedicated
surgeon and willing to make the tough decisions needed to treat the men
properly.</P>
<P>To add some spice and romance to the tale, Marlowe takes over an
attractive Southern belle's mansion, Hannah Hunter (Constance Towers).
When she tricks him into thinking she's a bimbo and discovers his plans,
he is forced to take her and her loyal Negro slave Lukey (Althea Gibson)
along to prevent her from tipping off the Confederates. Hunter is
well-thought of by Marlowe for her feistiness, horsemanship, loyalty to
her cause, and the concern she has for Lukey. As the two fight with each
other throughout most of the film, by the film's climax they find they
are in love and look at themselves in a new light after all the battles
and horrors they have been through. For Ford, it is another heavy
symbolic moment, pointing out that the country will only stand strong
when it can love one another again and learn to respect those who fought
for what they believed in. Ford saves his anger the real enemies, two
Confederate deserters, one of whom is the character actor Strother
Martin, who is a vile thief. He gets knocked out by Marlowe and turned
over to the local sheriff as a deserter. Ford does not put up with
cowards in his films.</P>
<P>The film has a lot of gory scenes of surgery, which included showing the
amputation of a leg. That was a common operation during the Civil War
and so it gave the film an accurate historical perspective. It also
showed some violent battles scenes, especially when the Union forces
take Newton Station and the outmanned Confederate ragtag soldiers fight
bravely knowing they don't have a prayer. In one scene, children from a
military school are drawn into battle out of necessity by their elders
and Marlowe shows the good sense to retreat rather than to slaughter the
brave but foolish youngsters.</P>
<P>This is suprisingly the only film Ford made that was set during the
Civil War, and he does himself proud by pointing out the more noble
reasons the war was necessary. In Ford's oeuvre, this film would rate
somewhere in the middle or slightly better than that, it couldn't quite
get past all its static formula presentations to be a great film, but it
threw out some diverting ideas, making it a greater film than a typical
Western.</P>
