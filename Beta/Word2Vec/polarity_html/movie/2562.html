<P>     Throughout the ages, human beings have harbored a not-so-secret 
fascination about our kind.  "Children of the night" they call us, 
romanticizing the price that we pay for immortality.  If only they 
understood the pain, the hunger, the loneliness...  But I digress.  We 
are all aware of those things.  They are in our blood. </P>
<P>     Human movies made about vampires invariably get almost all of the 
facts wrong.  They see us as demons, beings motivated by evil.  They 
ascribe to our actions an eroticism that is never intended.  For the 
first time, however, a mortal has delved beneath the legends to find 
some strain of truth.  The movie is CRONOS and the director, Guillermo 
del Toro, has removed all the religious and sexual trappings from his 
tale - as well as the fangs (stupid things, fangs - wolves have them, 
not vampires). </P>
<P>    CRONOS follows the transformation of one Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi) 
from a human antiques dealer to one of us.  The stages of his change 
are familiar to those who have gone through it, although not 
necessarily similar to what other movies show.  Who among us has not, 
like Jesus, bent on hands and knees to lick spilled blood from a 
floor?  And who has not felt the sting of the insect as it tears into 
our flesh to change us from living to undead? </P>
<P>     Jesus accidentally discovers the "Cronos device", a golden egg-
shaped instrument that, if used properly, unlocks the door to immortality.  
Whether Jesus operates the gizmo correctly is immaterial (personally, 
I did things a little differently when it was my turn, but that's off 
the subject).  In the end, he gets his desire, although not in the 
manner he hopes for or expects.  Instead of living a full life, he 
becomes a member of the undead - the real undead, that is, not the 
fictitious creations of human storytellers. </P>
<P>     A mortal (Claudio Brook) is after the Cronos device for his own use.  
Dying of cancer, he will do anything to continue his feeble existence.  
So he sends his oafish nephew Angel (Ron Perlman) to procure the 
instrument at any costs.  Of course, Angel messes up and his actions 
unwittingly become crucial to Jesus' passage from the mortal world to 
that where we dwell. </P>
<P>     Since we can't be photographed, a real vampire obviously can't play 
the part of Jesus (more's the pity).  Instead, a human actor by the 
name of Federico Luppi, who reminds one of Geppetto in PINNOCHIO, is 
made up to look like one of us.  Actually, it isn't a very convincing 
makeup job.  The latex applications aren't all that realistic.  I, for 
one, would never be fooled.  One might have hoped that for the first 
genuine motion picture treatment of vampirism, they would have spent a 
little more money.  Oh well.  This wasn't made in Hollywood, after 
all... </P>
<P>     There's one disturbing thing in CRONOS that should bother all real 
vampires.  Jesus has a weakness that none of us would dare permit - 
his love for his granddaughter.  While such an emotion is 
understandable before the transformation, its presence afterwards 
serves only to dilute his viciousness and mute his killer instinct.   </P>
<P>     With the exception of Aurora (Tamara Shanath), Jesus' grand-
daughter, none of the humans are developed particularly well.  This is 
especially true in the case of Angel, who comes across as a bumbling 
idiot.  CRONOS is more concerned with ideas and atmosphere than 
people, which is fine with me.  I don't think much of the human race 
in general, so why waste precious movie time delving into their 
personalities? </P>
<P>     There's one really frightening moment near the beginning of the 
movie, where a vampire is shown with a stake through his chest.  This 
scene gave me the shivers and I felt myself reflexively patting my own 
left breast for reassurance.  Other than that, there were no unnerving 
images in CRONOS.  There's a lot of blood and gore - but that's rather 
routine. </P>
<P>     After sitting through countless re-tellings of the DRACULA story, 
it's refreshing to finally see something that gets close to reality.  I 
give all the credit to writer/director Guillermo del Toro, although I 
wonder where he got his remarkably accurate information from.  Has 
anyone seen Mr. del Toro between dawn and dusk, I wonder?  </P>
