<PRE>                                BODY SNATCHERS
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Gabrielle Anwar, Terry Kenney, Billy Wirth, Meg Tilly.
Screenplay:  Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli & Nicholas St. John.
Director:  Abel Ferrara.</P>
<P>     Abel Ferrara's BODY SNATCHERS marks the third screen adaptation of
Jack Finney's novel THE BODY SNATCHERS, and you'd think that there
wouldn't be all that much new to say about pod people by now.  Don
Siegel's 1956 INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS captured small-town
menace; Phillip Kaufman's 1978 version transferred the story to San
Francisco for a metaphor for big city alienation.  The scene for this
latest adaptation is an army base, and the metaphor has changed as
well.  Somewhere in BODY SNATCHERS is a poke at the military mindset,
but it's buried beneath layers of atmosphere, atmosphere which works
but doesn't make that extra leap to real terror.</P>
<P>     BODY SNATCHERS opens as the Malone family makes its way towards
Fort Daly, Alabama.  Dad Steve (Terry Kenney) is an Environmental
Protection Agency investigator sent to check out toxic waste storage at
the base, and he brings along daughter Marti (Gabrielle Anwar), new
wife Carol (Meg Tilly) and Carol's six-year-old son Andy (Reilly
Murphy).  It's not long after they arrive before it becomes clear that
things aren't quite right at Fort Daly.  The base physician (Forest
Whitaker) notes a preponderance of paranoid episodes among soldiers and
family members, and everyone seems just a bit too serene.  Eventually,
the full extent of the invasion is obvious to the Malones, and a young
pilot (Billy Wirth) becomes the only person they can trust to help them
escape.</P>
<P>     Director Ferrara (BAD LIEUTENANT) has crafted a stylish and spooky
look for the film, filtered in dark ambers and deep blues, full of
shadows and twisted angles.  The issue of identity is always present,
as actors frequently appear only as silhouettes against the light, or
veiled by other shadows.  Some early scenes highlighting the pod
people's uniformity, particularly a frighteningly comic scene where
young Andy realizes the other kids in day care lack a certain artistic
creativity, are extremely well-handled.  Ferrara also manages the
tricky task of directing his actors so that the transformed characters
appear clearly to have changed without playing the stock blank-faced
automoton.  Technically, BODY SNATCHERS hits just about all of its
marks, particularly with its rather graphic image of what happens to
the remains of a human body after the transformation has taken place.</P>
<P>     Yet while BODY SNATCHERS held my attention, it didn't do anything
particularly interesting which seemed to warrand a re-telling of this
already twice-told tale.  The idea behind setting the invasion on a
military base is sound; if everyone in the Army starts acting like
drones with a singular purpose, who's going to notice?  The
screenwriters throw in one speech by the base commander (FULL METAL
JACKET's R. Lee Ermey) which seems designed to emphasize this point,
but Ferrara doesn't do much with it.  Familial alienation seems to be a
more prevalent theme, as Marti deals with her step-family, and her new
friend Jenn (Christine Elise) copes with an alcoholic mother.  No
single theme really drives this BODY SNATCHERS, nor are any of the
characters interesting enough to pull it along with them.</P>
<P>     Structurally, BODY SNATCHERS suffers from a climax which seems far
too drawn out.  Once the Malones start running, the tension should
continue to build, but too many of the scenes involving confrontations
between "real" humans and the 'Snatchers lack punch.  There is one
wickedly chilling moment of revelation, but it is isolated.  BODY
SNATCHERS does a fantastic job of establishing its tone, and it does
offer a few decent scares.  The problem with Ferrara's pacing is that
it's like the Body Snatchers themselves:  too cool when the adrenaline
should be flowing.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 pods:  5.</PRE>
