<PRE>VENGO
A film review by Rachel Gordon
Copyright 2001 filmcritic.com</PRE>
<P>Set in Spain, Vengo is a standard mob story with a highly artistic
twist.  There isn't much of a plot, and what there is isn't that
important.  It is simply a frame within which to explore the culture of
some vibrant Spanish gypsies.  In fact, the actual "talkie" scenes
almost become too much of a distraction from the rich portrayal of the
community.</P>
<P>In Vengo, there are two warring families whom you can't tell apart until
they are yelling at each other.  You connect with Cacao (Antonio
Canales) because he is followed throughout the film.  He is charismatic,
even in arrogance.  Everyone loves and obeys him, somewhat at a
distance, as his daughter recently died.  He is the guardian of his
nephew because his brother shot a member of the Caravacas family, which
wants blood for blood, like any Godfather movie, while Cacao tries his
best to make peace.</P>
<P>Cacao spends time with his family, throwing parties with hired bands,
making sure his retarded nephew has a good time.  In between are moments
with those in charge of the Caravacas family, building a slow, poignant
path to revenge.  Every once in a while a few comedic notes are thrown
in as the older women of the village clean up after the youngsters.</P>
<P>Luckily the plot development is repetitively simple so that all of the
characters have room to be sympathetic.  There isn't an annoying "good
and evil" perspective placed on the viewer.  This film is not about
picking sides in an argument or making morality calls.  It's simply an
age-old dilemma of how one family deals with loss and another family who
must grudgingly accept responsibility for it.</P>
<P>But the music and dancing are the key roles in Vengo.  Between the
variety shown and the pride taken in skill and passing down of
tradition, it's easy to become mesmerized with the culture.  A nice
added touch is that men take as much pride as women in being able to
evoke physical grace.  And though the dancing does have a sexually
alluring quality, it is not the reason for participation.</P>
<P>It can be difficult to grasp the lyrics because they are only partially
subtitled.  This is unfortunate for outsiders who know little about
gypsy life because it's impossible to guess at the inspiration for such
emoting performances.  At least the emotional expression of the singers
provides an easily sympathetic intensity that evokes an understanding
about how attached the music is to tradition.  You can assume that for
every major change in their culture, there is a song to go with it that
is passed down from one generation to the next.</P>
<P>Gatlif has managed to utilize an old, almost boring, plot structure to
respectfully portray a culture much overlooked.  He obviously loved his
subject and the way in which it was filmed provides a contagious
appreciation for a people often misunderstood.</P>
