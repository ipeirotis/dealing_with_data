<PRE>                           TAKING ON THE KENNEDYS
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     So what are some of the characteristics one might look for in a
first time Congressional representative?  How about someone who worked
his way through medical school and then went on to set up an inner-city
clinic for women with HIV?  How about someone who is not wealthy and
who donates large portions of his time to serving the poor?  Rhode
Island's Kevin Vigilante has these credentials, so you might think he
would have a good chance when running for an open seat in Congress.
Well, if you did, you would be wrong.  He had the bad luck to run
against a young guy with the last name of Kennedy.  As the film says,
Vigilante was running against Camelot.</P>
<P>     Joshua Seftel's engrossing documentary TAKING ON THE KENNEDYS
chronicles the 1994 race of Vigilante against Patrick Kennedy.  The
film is not about ideology or political parties.  It focuses in on the
cachet of a famous name, the importance of money, the impact of the
media, and the efficacy of negative advertising, even if blatantly
false.  I saw the film as part of San Jose's Cinequest film festival.
I have been told that some PBS stations have played the film as well.</P>
<P>     After being treated for cocaine abuse in school and after all of
the negative publicity from his connection as a witness in the William
Kennedy Smith rape trial, Patrick Kennedy at the young age of
twenty-six might be considered an unlikely candidate for Congress.
Nevertheless, he announces his candidacy and starts with a fund raiser
hosted by his friend Tony Bennett.  Guests at the party get autographed
pictures of themselves with Bennett and Kennedy.</P>
<P>     Throughout the campaign, when Vigilante calls a news conference,
the media ignores him.  Patrick asks cousins John Jr. or Caroline to
visit, and not only do all the local reporters show up, even the
national media covers it.  These Kennedy events bear a remarkable
resemblance to a three ring circus.</P>
<P>     Kennedy uses his family's vast wealth to bury Vigilante in
negative ads.  Early on in the campaign, Kennedy's ads claim that
Vigilante is getting most of his money from the big pharmaceutical
companies.  In fact, he is getting less than ten percent from all
medical groups combined and most of his contributions were small ones.
Kennedy, on the other hand, is getting thirty percent of his money from
trial lawyers, labor unions, and Hollywood.  (I should point out that
the facts from this review come from the documentary which I have every
reason to believe are accurate, but I have no way of verifying the
facts as presented.)</P>
<P>     Perhaps most surprising of all is that with three weeks left in
the campaign and an unstoppable thirty percentage points ahead in the
polls, Kennedy buys $100,000 worth of television ad time to accuse
Vigilante of having faked an auto injury while in medical school and of
trying to extort money from the driver of the other car.  Up until this
point, Vigilante has been saying nothing but nice things about Kennedy
personally, no matter how false his negative ads are.  Vigilante says
the latest diatribe from Kennedy is too much, and that he never faked
any injury.  He and his wife go ballistic and feel that they must
finally turn negative on Kennedy.</P>
<P>     They snoop around a bit and find Kennedy's ex-landlady.  It seems
that she rented part of her house to him and even made him dinner
frequently as a gesture of kindness to him.  When he moved out
suddenly, he had amassed $3,800 in back rent.  He left without paying
it, telling her he could not afford to pay his debt to her.  Since he
never came back and paid and since she is a poor woman in her 80s, she
is not happy with Kennedy.  She agrees to do an ad against him.  Rhode
Island has one of the largest concentration of senior citizens in the
country.  Kennedy's ads targeting older people have been boasting
throughout the campaign that only he can be relied upon since Vigilante
is just a tool of the drug companies.  In the last week of the campaign
Vigilante runs an ad with the landlady telling her story. In it she
says that if Kennedy didn't care about me, why do you think he would
care you.</P>
<P>     As we now know, Kennedy won handsomely.  The ending credits tells
us that he is now the leading contender for Rhode Island's Senate seat
in the year 2000.</P>
<P>     The most prophetic scene in the film happens early in the campaign
when Vigilante is discussing health care with an older woman at a
senior citizens' picnic.  She, like Vigilante, is dead set against
Clinton's health plan.  Since they are both passionate on the issue, he
asks her if she would consider voting for him.  Heavens no, she
explains.  The other guy afterall is a Kennedy.  The others there
agree.  The only complaint they have with Patrick Kennedy is that his
autograph is a little too sloppy.  The Kennedy part of his name is not
as readable as they would like.</P>
<P>     TAKING ON THE KENNEDYS runs 57 minutes.  It is not rated but would
be a G.  I was mesmerized by the film.  I recommend it to people of all
political persuasions and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
