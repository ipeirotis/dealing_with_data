<P>     For the record, I don't tend to put much stock in conspiracy
theories.  I don't believe the CIA had Kennedy killed, I don't believe
there is a flying saucer hidden somewhere near Roswell, New Mexico and I
don't believe that polio vaccinations are part of a secret plot to place
tracking devices in our bodies.  Call me a starry-eyed optimist if you
must, but I think people are capable of quite enough selfish nastiness on
an individual basis, and that that very same selfishness makes cooperative
nastiness an endeavor riddled with problems.  When it comes to Hollywood,
however, I might be willing to make an exception.  Studios just may be
conspiring to sap from our brains the ability to recognize clumsy stories
which make only the faintest sense.  By comparison to the crimes SHADOW
CONSPIRACY perpetrates on an unsuspecting audience, the crimes in its
so-called plot seem positively benign.</P>
<P>     Charlie Sheen stars as Bobby Bishop, a Presidential speech writer and
advisor on his way up the Washington power chain through his deft ability
to doctor a spin.  It is just another day in the capital when a former
professor of Bobby's (Theodore Bikel) meets Bobby on the street to warn
him of a secret government cabal called Shadow -- just before the
professor is shot in the head by a brutal agent (Stephen Lang).  Suddenly
Bobby finds himself running for his life, able to trust only two people:
Jake Conrad (Donald Sutherland), Bobby's mentor and the White House
Chief-of-Staff, and Amanda Givens (Linda Hamilton), a reporter and Bobby's
former girlfriend.  Together, they must find out who is behind Shadow and
what their diabolical plans are.</P>
<P>     Sheen appears to be basing his film career on playing the dupe (he
was also a patsy sniffing out dirty doings in TERMINAL VELOCITY and THE
ARRIVAL), but if he could be suckered into taking on a script like this,
perhaps he's not doing all that much acting.  SHADOW CONSPIRACY, credited
to the writing tandem of Adi Hasak and Ric Gibbs, appears to be the
product of screenplay software, introducing hackneyed situations and
characters without enough energy to make the cliches tolerable.  The hero
is established as a cocky smooth-talker, but instead of giving him chances
to talk himself out of difficult situations the script keeps him
perpetually running away from the Terminator-like Lang (Linda Hamilton
must have been experiencing serious deja-vu).  Hamilton acts as the
obligatory romantic sparring partner, except that Bobby and Amanda grumble
at each other only briefly before settling into a dreary camaraderie.  The
betrayal, the chase scene, the narrow escape...all the ingredients are
there, but they sit there flatly without the benefit of a single moment of
imagination</P>
<P>     If the basic material is bad, then the execution is even worse.  The
direction (by RAMBO's George P. Cosmatos) and editing (by Robert A.
Ferretti) in SHADOW CONSPIRACY are inept to a degree that seems almost
(conspiratorially?) designed.  One chase flashes from a luxury hotel to a
homeless encampment to a sewer out of LES MISERABLES with a blissful
disregard for continuity; scenes designed for tension become
inconsequential blurs, and characters wander through the narrative for an
hour before you have a clue what they are supposed to be doing.  Cosmatos
doesn't even understand basic principles of drama, making a point of
showing us a tricky-to-unlatch seat-belt which then plays no further part
in the story, an un-fired gun which probably sent Chekhov to spinning in
his grave.  SHADOW CONSPIRACY is the kind of incomprehensible mess where a
highly trained agent is willing to run through a hotel and a city street
firing a gun in full view of hundreds of witnesses, then decides to get
secretive by building a remote-controlled toy helicopter to assassinate
the President.</P>
<P>     That climactic scene at least provides a moment of absurdist fun, the
only one SHADOW CONSPIRACY has to offer unless you count the floppy hats
Hamilton favors which are sure to gain a White House correspondent
professional respect.  Mostly, it is just a plodding and somber piece of
nonsense which seems to expect brownie points for showing us all the ways
the government can keep an eye on us, and ends with an ominous tracking
shot to the perspective of a spy satellite.  Personally, I feel more
threatened by the prospect of lazy, pre-fabricated thrillers foisted off 
on the American viewing public as entertainment.  If the people who
brought us SHADOW CONSPIRACY are supposed to be the ones to shine the
light on sinister conspiracies which threaten our freedoms, all I have to
say is:  who's watching the watchmen?</P>
