<P>     DAYLIGHT is an action picture without a villain.  Frankly, it 
doesn't have much of a plot, either.  Or characters, for that matter.  
In fact, the so-called dramatic elements of this movie are so shaky that 
you wonder if the film makers spent all of their money on a star 
(Sylvester Stallone, who reportedly got about $20 million) and special 
effects, then sort of made up the script as they went along.  This is 
the kind of effort that would make Irwin Allen proud. </P>
<P>     Unless you've been isolated from the overhyped promo campaign for 
DAYLIGHT, you already know the basic story.  An out-of-control car 
zipping through the Holland Tunnel crashes into a truck carrying toxic 
waste.  There's an explosion of cataclysmic proportions that causes both 
ends of the tunnel -- in New York and New Jersey -- to collapse.  
Although almost everyone inside is killed, there are a few survivors.  
But the situation looks grim.  Air is running out.  Water, seeping 
through the crumbling walls, is rising.  Where's John McClane when you 
need him?</P>
<P>     Although Bruce Willis is nowhere to be found, Sylvester Stallone is 
on hand.  He plays Kit Lauria, the former head of New York City's 
Emergency Medical Services who has been driving a limo since his forced 
resignation.  Now, because he's on the scene when the disaster occurs, 
he becomes involved.  Ultimately, that participation puts his life in 
jeopardy as he decides to navigate his way through a series of huge fans 
and enter the tunnel to help the trapped victims.</P>
<P>     When it comes to pyrotechnics, DAYLIGHT has the right stuff.  The 
explosion at the beginning is truly breathtaking, rivaling anything that 
TWISTER's tornadoes threw at audiences.  Unfortunately, the film brings 
out the best it has to offer first.  None of the other action sequences, 
which include floods, more explosions, and cave-ins, approach the level 
of spectacle offered by the initial flash-and-bang.  As a result, it can 
be rightfully claimed that DAYLIGHT is actually anti-climactic.</P>
<P>     For the most part, however, the edge-of-the-seat moments accomplish 
what they intend to.  In fact, this movie is at its best when it's in 
high gear, because the audience isn't tempted to think too deeply about 
the other aspects of the production, many of which are subpar.  
Adrenaline is nice, but it's all-the-more rewarding in movies like DIE 
HARD and SPEED, when there's a little more to go with it.</P>
<P>     Director Rob Cohen shows a deft hand with the stunts, but he chokes 
on the numerous "character building" moments.  Not that the script, 
credited to Leslie Bohem, is an asset.  Most of the dialogue is poor, 
and some of it, including a ludicrous "raw oyster pep talk", is 
downright ridiculous.  DAYLIGHT probably would have worked better if all 
the players had been mute.  </P>
<P>     On top of that, there are too many incidental characters.  Of 
course, they're all stereotypes, but each gets so little screen time 
that it's difficult to care about any of them.  First of all, we have 
the requisite dysfunctional family -- a mother (a shrill Karen Young), 
father (David O. Sanders), and daughter (Danielle Harris, who twice 
played one of Michael Myers' HALLOWEEN victims).  There's also an 
elderly couple (Claire Bloom and Colin Fox), a group of convicts (one of 
whom is Stallone's real-life son, Sage), a failed writer (Amy 
Brenneman), and a cop (Stan Shaw).  Viggo Mortensen has a brief 
appearance as a would-be action hero who can't quite get the job done.  
Then there's also the above-ground crew, which features about four 
recognizable faces (including Dan Hedaya and Vanessa Bell Calloway).</P>
<P>     On the acting front, Stallone isn't all that bad.  He's playing a 
flawed hero, and there are actually signs of the kind of emoting he did 
long ago in ROCKY.  Amy Brenneman (FEAR) has the Sandra Bullock role 
opposite Stallone's Keanu Reeves, although she can't quite match up to 
Bullock's star quality.  Viggo Mortensen's (CRIMSON TIDE) brief time in 
the spotlight is enjoyable, particularly since the potentially-annoying 
character doesn't overstay his welcome.  Of the others, no one stands 
out, except perhaps Karen Young (the title character in Tom Noonan's THE 
WIFE), who is irritating.</P>
<P>     On balance, I have trouble recommending DAYLIGHT because it is 
riddled with problems.  Nevertheless, I doubt that action fans (and 
Stallone aficionados in particular) will be disappointed.  For, although 
as a complete story this film has more cracks than the collapsing 
tunnel, thrill-seekers in search of two hours of cinematic action will 
find that DAYLIGHT falls considerably short of being a disaster.</P>
