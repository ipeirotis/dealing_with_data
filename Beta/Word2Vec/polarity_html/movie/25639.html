<P>***The following review contains spoilers***</P>
<P>"It's just... the way... we are." 
 --- A rapist (Matt Frewer) responds to Supergirl's (Helen Slater) query
as to why she's being attacked, an example of the mind-numbingly bad
dialogue in Supergirl. </P>
<P>I'll admit it... I love Superman III.  I know it's hated amongst the
Superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for
Richard Pryor, but I still think it's a worthy addition to the Man of
Steel franchise. Supergirl, a spin-off film of sorts from the series'
same producers (Alexander and Ilya Salkind), doesn't even rival Superman
III in terms of quality, let alone Superman or Superman II. </P>
<P>Supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for
the rest of its two hour plus running time.  As the film begins we see
the residents of Argo City, a commune like place consisting of refugees
from Krypton which resides in "inner space", go about their daily
lives.  Ok... what?  So these are exiles from Krypton, which blew up
right?  Were they living there before Krypton exploded?  How do you get
to "inner space"?  This whole "inner space" notion is never explained,
particularly in terms of how these people get information from the
outside world.  How do they know where Superman went?  How do they know
he took the name Clark Kent and now works at the Daily Planet?  These
kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me. </P>
<P>Argo City is kept running by a power source called the Omegahedron.  One
day the founder of Argo City, Zaltar (Peter O' Toole), gives the
Omegahedron to Superman's cousin, Kara (Helen Slater), for use as
inspiration in her art.  Kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which
immediately crashes through the layer of "whatever" that protects the
city.  In the chaos, the Omegahedron sails out through the opening,
dooming the Argonians to death... in three days time, or something. 
Kara then climbs into a pod which Zaltar had designed for
interdimensional travel and chases after the Omegahedron to save her
world. </P>
<P>The power source travels directly to Earth and lands in the bowl of dip
belonging to a minor-league witch named Selena (Faye Dunaway) who,
immediately before her dip was ruined, announced her desires to rule the
world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend Nigel (Peter Cook).  Selena
somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil
plans, and she sets out to achieve world domination. </P>
<P>Selena is unaware of course that Kara has also arrived on Earth, and
that she's arrived as Supergirl (complete with appropriate costume). 
Supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives.  Ok...
huh?  Why does the Omegahedron fall from the sky but Supergirl shoots
out of the bottom of a lake?  Attention movie: explain yourself!  I'm
sorry, I can only suspend disbelief so much.  I can't buy into any of
this nonsense just because the movie wants me to. </P>
<P>Knowing that she needs a secret identity, Supergirl basically "wills"
herself into a school girl outfit (complete with a different hairstyle),
picks the alias Linda Lee and enrolls into school.  She's given her dorm
assignment, and who happens to be her roommate?  Lois Lane's sister,
Lucy.  Ok, coincidence is one thing folks, but we're getting really
contrived now.  What follows are some generic all-girls school
hijinks... complete with evil bully girls (mean for no reason, of
course) and even a shower scene (!).  Best moment though comes when
Supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts
stuffing it with socks.  At this point I'm rapidly wondering why I'm
bothering with this nonsense. </P>
<P>There is some credit to give to the film however.  One lengthy and
elaborate sequence featuring an "evil" bulldozer destroying a small town
in search of its "prey" is very well done.  Also, its commendable to see
genders reversed in the film, whereas the women have all the power and
the men are merely objects and tools.  Hart Bochner (Die Hard) is
particularly fun as Kara's love interest, a lovesick landscaper who is
under a spell cast by Selena (although he is unfortunately part of one
of the film's more ridiculous moments, when he has to be rescued from
being tapped by some "menacing" bumper cars). </P>
<P>Then there were numerous little things that bothered me.  The flying
effects are never convincing for a moment... it's all too obvious that
Helen Slater is hooked to wires.  Instead of having her look like she's
flying, the filmmakers wanted her to be "graceful", so she poses a lot
and does ballet-type maneuvers.  Also, who are the first two humans to
meet Supergirl when she arrives on Earth?  A pair of truck
drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a "wacky"
demise.  There is also some rampant product placement in the film, most
notably for Popeye's, Tylenol, and A&W Root Beer, with the latter
actually putting its logo on the T-shirt of one of the rapists (?!). 
Finally, just one word: monsters. </P>
<P>Faye Dunaway and Peter O'Toole ham it up unmercifully, however when
O'Toole overacts he's entertaining and when Dunaway does it she's
annoying (her character actually says the line "Seize them!" at one
point).  Dunaway's henchmen (played by Peter Cook and Brenda Vaccaro)
fare much better, with Vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of Ned
Beatty's Otis character from the first two Superman movies.  Helen
Slater effectively portrays Supergirl as the innocent, naive character
she's written to be, as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with
the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable.  Believability
aside though, it's still annoying. </P>
<P>Now despite all this negativity (and I'm not alone here... Supergirl is
not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles), leave it
to the good people at Anchor Bay Entertainment to actually make people
not only interested, but excited about its release on DVD!  They have
released TWO separate editions of the film on DVD, to the delight of
many people (including myself... yet I'm still unclear as to why, since
this movie is so awful). </P>
<P>The first and most widely available DVD release features the
International version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the
print which ran in U.S. theaters.  The movie is presented in its
original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1, is enhanced for 16x9
televisions, and has been remastered in full THX glory.  Extras on the
disc include: a full length audio commentary track with director Jeannot
Szwarc and "special project consultant" Scott Michael Bosco, the
excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called Supergirl-The Making of
a Feature (dig that workout montage!), 5 trailers, 3 TV spots, talent
bios, in-depth storyboards (accompanied by score from the movie), and
assorted still galleries.  </P>
<P>The transfer on this International version is incredible... you'd think
you were watching a new release.  Images are sharp, colors jump off the
screen, and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts.  Only some
special effects sequences show the wear of time, and there just isn't
much that can be done about that (unless you're obsessive like George
Lucas).  The new THX approved audio is loud and clear in all the right
places, however you'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre Jerry
Goldsmith score (which is completely unrelated to John Williams' classic
Superman theme and sounds better suited for a Cannon Films' Golan-Globus
production). </P>
<P>The commentary track featuring director Szwarc and project consultant
Bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio
commentaries.  Bosco seems to be an expert in all things Supergirl and
is there with Szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track. 
Bosco probes Szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything
that comes onscreen, and we learn a great deal more about the film as a
result of his participation.  Although, at times you can tell that Bosco
is looking for a specific response from Szwarc, and is surprised when he
doesn't get that response. </P>
<P>We learn some fascinating tidbits on the track, most notably the
"almost" appearance in the film by Christopher Reeve.  Great detail is
given about Superman's proposed role in the original script before Reeve
(wisely) dropped out.  As it stands, Superman is written off early on in
the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of
light years away on some sort of peace mission.  For the sake of
brevity, I won't even get into that one. </P>
<P>Szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the Salkinds
(and everyone else agreed) that Supergirl needed to stand on its own,
replacing the science fiction of the Superman films with cutsy
"whimsical fantasy" nonsense.  Bosco also points out scenes not in the
American release as they come along, claiming that had they been in the
original release it would have been a hit at the box office.  Again, for
the sake of brevity, I won't even get into that one. </P>
<P>Anchor Bay has also released a limited edition (only 50,000 copies
pressed) two-disc set.  Disc one contains everything mentioned for the
regular release.  Disc two features the never before seen director's cut
of the film, which runs 138 minutes long.  The additions mainly consist
of scene extensions which don't add much of note, except for a few
moments which lengthen Peter O'Toole's screen time (particularly during
his latter appearances).  The print is rough in spots and the sound is
only in mono, but fans of the film won't care.  One question though...
shouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the
film? </P>
<P>I'd never seen Supergirl before I sat down to watch this DVD.  I was
nine when it was released to theaters, and even then I was smart enough
to inform my parents not to take me to see it.  So when I popped the DVD
into my player and sat down in my easy chair I had no idea what to
expect.  I knew the film wasn't beloved and I never had any interest in
it before, but I was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive
amount of work put into the disc.  As the disc began to spin I was
rather impressed with the opening sequence, which made me sit up and
wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong.  Come to
find out however it was just the Chase Digital Stereo logo... so I slunk
back into my seat as the nightmare started. </P>
<P>At the end of the film, Supergirl flies back into the lake with the
Omegahedron, and FLIES back to Argo City.  Ugh, I give up.  I'm
surprised I even made it to the end of the film not once, not twice, but
THREE times to review these discs.  Supergirl is definitely a terrific
DVD package, but a very lousy movie. [PG]</P>
