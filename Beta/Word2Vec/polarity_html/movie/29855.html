<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P> "Joy Ride" is calculated to draw fear from the viewer and does not attempt to
develop character or enlarge its story, as it goes on a wild cross-country ride
into dark terrain. This on the road film is set in the open spaces of the West.
Its menacing trucker theme reminded me most of Steven Spielberg's 1971 film
"Duel," though this one is played more for laughs. It's also aided by many
noirish images and small touches among the supporting characters that give the
film a quirky humor, as it scales familiar genre territory from remote gas
stations to dead-end dusty roads to hostile redneck bars. But here the material
is freshened with a different take on it. </P>
<P>A University of California student, Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker), calls up his
unrequited love, Venna (Leelee Sobieski), someone he's romantically interested
in but has only been Platonic friends with so far. She's from his New Jersey
hometown and is now a college freshman in Boulder, Colorado. He offers the
attractive girl a ride home for her summer break in a beat-up vintage 70s
Chrysler Newport he just purchased for this occasion. His good-for-nothing
brother, Fuller (Zahn), a petty criminal with oodles of manic energy and a gift
for trouble, is coincidentally being released from a Salt Lake City, Utah jail.
Lewis begrudgingly agrees to also pick him up on the request of his sister,
hoping he won't ruin his secret romantic plans. </P>
<P>Fuller buys a CB radio for $40 and uses the handle Black Sheep and goads the
more timid and straight-arrow Lewis into accepting the handle of Mama's Boy, and
then gets him to disguise his voice as a young lady with the handle of Candy
Cane. They play a practical joke on a trucker with the handle Rusty Nail (the
voice of Matthew Kimbrough), by getting him to come to the next-door room in the
Wyoming motel they are staying at with a bottle of pink champagne to meet her at
midnight. </P>
<P>They get a laugh over this as they listen in through the thin motel walls when
he arrives, but the trucker doesn't take the joke lightly. In fact, he fatally
disfigures the mistaken guy in that motel room, who is found unconscious on the
highway the next morning. </P>
<P>The brothers get no comfort from the Wyoming State Troopers investigating the
murder and find themselves on the road again and being followed by the trucker
in his gigantic rig, whose ominous voice we hear intimidating them over the CB
and telling them that they'll pay for that joke. But we never see him through
the hazy windshield of his rig, which makes him even more scary. When the
brothers reach Venna, they think they are out of the woods after telling their
twisted tormentor there's no young woman. They therefore fail to tell her what
happened--not wanting to scare her off. But returning to their Nebraska motel
after a bitter experience in a redneck bar, they receive a threatening call from
Rusty Nail and he mysteriously knows everything about them and Venna. How he
does--just doesn't seem to matter, as the film plays out its hand as a
sophomoric joke gone dangerously bad. Anyway, while the story is moving at a
frenetic pace, serious thought is not called for. There's B-film fun here if you
don't mind the many holes in the story and how slight the plot is and how the
sadistic trucker can set so many successful traps for them when it doesn't seem
possible, and that we are never let in on the secret of how he does it. </P>
<P>When the boys frantically get Venna to forget about the room she paid for and
jump into their car to hit the road, she only asks: "How scared am I supposed to
be?" Fuller nervously says, "Much more than usual." </P>
<P>There's a sense of the macabre in the Nebraska cornfields, as the psychopathic
homicidal trucker starts to do his thing as he closes in on them. But there's
always an element of fun in how absurd this all is, and the mostly teen-ager
audience where I saw this film laughed at parts of it and shrieked in fright
during the parts that were creepy. </P>
<P>It's not a terribly interesting film but the director John Dahl ("Red Rock
West"/"The Last Seduction") and his writers Clay Tarver and J. J. Abrams, have
made a film that knows its audience and knows how to pull its punches. It's an
easy film to critique for what it doesn't do, but what it does do very well is
take you for a comically dark fantasy ride and the filmmaker keeps this thriller
tense throughout. The result is a cleverly done cultish film that's scary,
building to that grotesquely violent finale in the motel. It's also a bit kinky
without any explicit sex scenes. A film that should be admired totally for its
entertainment value and filmmaking craftsmanship, and the engaging performance
by Zahn. </P>
