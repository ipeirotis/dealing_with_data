<PRE>OFFICE SPACE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>In writer and director Mike Judge's brilliant comedy, OFFICE SPACE,
Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is a software engineer who used to have a
big problem, his boring job, but he's fixed that. He's not quitting, but
since he doesn't like it, he has decided simply that he'll stop going
into the office anymore. Eventually, a relaxed Peter will show up every
now and then, but only on his terms.</P>
<P>OFFICE SPACE, the perfect movie for the cubical dwellers of the Dilbert
generation, has a low budget look, but its humor is right up there with
last year's THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. Whereas the latter used
raunchy humor to get its laughs, OFFICE SPACE uses dead-on, topical
humor that is only sporadically risque to produce laughs so hard you may
almost get sick. I know I got into so many laughing convulsions that I
found myself choking.</P>
<P>As the movie opens, Peter and his coworkers are stuck in a parking lot
masquerading as a highway as they inch toward a company called Initech,
where they work on banking software. Peter has 8 bosses, probably due to
the wonders of dotted-line management, and each of them love to come
cooing into his office, complaining in the nicest but most irritating
tone. Today's crisis is that he forgot to put the cover sheet on the TPS
report. His bosses keep dropping by to remind him that there was a memo
about it. "Did you get that memo?" they chirp with dripping sincerity.</P>
<P>In a small supporting role, Gary Cole, from A SIMPLE PLAN, delivers the
best performance of the movie. As Lumberg, Peter's main boss, Cole gives
a chillingly gracious interpretation of a boss who appears compassionate
on the surface but underneath is all of life's annoying bosses rolled
into one. Patronizing and unreasonably demanding, he infuriates Peter
and his coworkers, Samir (Ajay Naidu) and Michael Bolton (David Herman)
-- no, not that Michael Bolton.</P>
<P>As Peter battles his office aggravations with little success, he wonders
out loud to his coworkers where it will all lead. "What if we're still
doing this when we're 50?" he muses. He tries the thought exercise from
school, "What would you do if you had a million dollars?" The test is
supposed to reveal what you really want to do with your life, but the
question proves as useless as it is trite.</P>
<P>There are other discontented workers as well, the company being a hotbed
of disinterested and unmotivated employees. "There are guys in life who
don't have to put up with all of this, like that guy with the Pet Rock,"
Tom (Richard Riehle) declares with a hopeless tone that belies his
words. The script mixes honest poignancy with crisp comedy that packs a
wallop. Even minor actors, like the one that plays a magazine salesman
from the ghetto and who appears in a single, brief scene, are
wonderfully funny.</P>
<P>Jennifer Aniston plays a small but important part as Peter's girlfriend
and a waitress without enough "flair." She works at one of those themed
restaurants, in which she is required to wear at least 15 pieces of
sloganed buttons and other accoutrements on her clothing. Her manager
keeps ragging on her because she only wears the minimum number of
pieces. If she really loved her job as she should, she should want to
wear more, as he keeps reminding her. As sweet and lovely as Aniston was
in the part, I kept thinking of Parker Posey from her role in a similar
movie, CLOCKWATCHERS, and how Posey would have added a interesting
harder edge to the part.</P>
<P>After an amazing first act, the movie appears to have painted itself in
a corner with the writer having milked the angst-filled employees idea
for all it is worth, but then the movie takes off again with some quite
surprising twists. Only in the short concluding act does the story lose
its footing a bit. Still, the structure of the movie is relatively
unimportant. It is in the small episodes that the movie delivers its
punch. Typical of these is the way some consultants determine an easier
way for a manager to lay someone off -- just stop paying him and he will
eventually get the idea. And it reveals a secret way for cubical
dwellers to get that window office that they've always coveted. You'll
have to see the movie to learn the trick.</P>
<P>Some movies have universal appeal, and some are more narrowly targeted.
Whereas I think most people will find OFFICE SPACE quite funny, those
who live in high tech meccas like the Silicon Valley or those who work
in cubicles will undoubtedly love the picture. Finally, there is a
litmus test. If you've tried reading the Dilbert cartoons about the
working world and have never been able to understand why there are
funny, OFFICE SPACE probably isn't the movie for you.</P>
<P>OFFICE SPACE runs a fast 1:30. It is rated R for profanity and brief
sexuality and would be fine for teenagers.</P>
