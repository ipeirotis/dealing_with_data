<P>     DAS BOOT, Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 international sensation, has
become the latest motion picture to be remastered for a major re-
release.  Unlike a certain space trilogy, there aren't any "optically
enhanced" scenes, but the 1997 version of DAS BOOT is significantly
different from the first cut.  More than sixty minutes of footage from
the original German TV mini-series has been seamlessly woven back into
the movie's tapestry.  Jarring transitions have been smoothed out and
character development has been greatly enhanced.  The result is a more
complete viewing experience.  DAS BOOT, universally recognized as the
best submarine movie of all time and one of the most heart-pounding
thrillers ever filmed, is even better this time around than it was in
its initial release.</P>
<P>     During World War II in Germany, submarine duty was considered a
"glamour job."  It was nearly every young man's dream to be granted the
privilege of serving the Fatherland aboard one of the sleek, glorious U-
boats.  As is often the case, the grim truth proved to be radically
different from the shining fiction.  Submarine service was a grueling,
debilitating, dehumanizing experience, and DAS BOOT was the first motion
picture to de-mythologize it completely. </P>
<P>     The bulk of the film takes place within the boat, and follows a
group of characters as they are transformed from the clean-shaven,
energetic individuals who enter to the scraggly, dispirited men who
eventually emerge.  We see the story through the eyes of a German war
correspondent (Herbert Gronemeyer) who is on board the boat for a single
tour.  The men are presented as he views them -- a cadre of competent
sailors united by bonds stronger than family or blood.  The Captain
(Jurgen Prochnow), an officer of great intelligence, experience, and
compassion, has earned the respect of every man under his command. 
However, unlike in many war movies, this leader is not a tactical
genius.  He can, and does, make mistakes -- some of which are costly. 
The crew is comprised of a diverse group of individuals, including a
party member, a chief engineer on the verge of a breakdown, and a young
man who longs for a reunion with his French fiancee. </P>
<P>     The strength of the director's cut of DAS BOOT is that some of
these secondary characters, who were realized only sketchily in the
original film, have been fleshed out this time around.  Many are no
longer just familiar faces lurking in the background; they are fully
formed men with histories, hopes, and dreams for the future.  By
developing so many characters this well, Petersen adds greater depth and
urgency to the action scenes, and increases the poignancy of the
bitterly ironic final sequence.</P>
<P>     Since this is a story about human beings, not politics, it's not
difficult or ethically troubling for audiences to find themselves in
sympathy with DAS BOOT's characters even if, during the time period
represented, they were the enemy.  Within the bowels of the submarine,
there's no room for Nazi philosophizing or cheerleading.  In fact, the
Captain expresses disdain for the Fuhrer and his minions.  Although this
was made as a German film about a uniquely German experience during a
painful episode in German history, DAS BOOT possesses an acute insight
that allows it to be understood and enjoyed by viewers all around the
world.</P>
<P>     When it comes to action, DAS BOOT is at the top of the class, and
it's no wonder that, following its initial release, Wolfgang Petersen
became a sought-after director (his later credits include ENEMY MINE,
SHATTERED, IN THE LINE OF FIRE, and 1997's AIR FORCE ONE).  From the
moment the crew first descends into the sub and we are given a tour of
its innards, the sense of claustrophobia is suffocating.  This feeling
builds alongside the tension until the two, in concert, are almost
unbearable.  In later scenes, when the air supply is running out, we can
feel ourselves gasping alongside the men, as if the oxygen is being
siphoned out of the theater.</P>
<P>     The battle scenes are superbly executed, not so much from a special
effects perspective, but in the way that Petersen keeps us on the edge
of our seats.  The two standout sequences occur when the boat attacks a
British caravan and when it attempts to wend its way through the
treacherous straits of Gibraltar.  Both are intense, nerve-wracking
pieces of film making that are apt to elevate the heart rate of even the
most blase viewer.  These aspects of DAS BOOT are so well-crafted, in
fact, that they lose little impact on a second or third viewing.  Even
knowing exactly what's going to occur, and how it's going to happen,
does little to diminish the experience.</P>
<P>     In addition to being a great thriller, DAS BOOT also makes pointed
statements about human nature and war, and the visceral eloquence with
which they are expressed highlights the film's power.  War is one of the
great dehumanizing experiences -- it becomes "us" against "them."  The
objective is victory, simply because that's the only path to survival. 
This is true whether the battle is in the sky, on the land, on the sea,
or under the surface.  In DAS BOOT, the victims of the U-boat's attacks
remain faceless entities until one wrenching scene when the crew is
forced to confront the terrible ramifications of their actions.  Naval
battles often seems like the cleanest sort of warfare, with targets
distanced from their attackers by fathoms of water and hits registered
as blips on a screen.  DAS BOOT effectively dispels that illusion when
the men aboard the submarine are forced to look on helplessly while the
survivors of a ship they destroyed die by fire and water.</P>
<P>     I have often said that PATTON is the greatest war movie, but DAS
BOOT comes in a close second.  The battle scenes don't define either
film; superlative acting, top-notch writing, and exceptional direction
do.  Throughout the history of motion pictures, there have been many
fine movies set in the cramped confines of the submarine -- 1957's ENEMY
BELOW, 1958's RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP, 1990's THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, and
1995's CRIMSON TIDE -- but none approaches the impact achieved by DAS
BOOT.  This film takes all of the drama and suspense inherent in a
submarine-based story and delivers it in a near-perfect package,
establishing DAS BOOT as not just a terrific adrenaline rush, but one of
the best movies ever made.</P>
