<P>RATCATCHER (director/writer: Lynne Ramsay; cinematographer: Alwin Kuchler;
editor: Lucia Zucchetti; cast: William Eadie (James), Tommy Flanagan (Da), Mandy
Matthews (Ma), Lynne Ramsay, Jr. (Anne Marie), Michelle Stewart (Ellen), Leanne
Mullen (Margaret Anne), John Miller (Kenny), Jackie Quinn (Mrs. Quinn); Runtime:
94; BBC Films/Holy Cow Films; 1999-UK) </P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A gritty and realistic tale about a troubled adolescent boy of 12, James
(Eadie), growing up in the slums of Glasgow who dreams of escaping. Lynne
Ramsay's brilliant debut film as director (she also wrote the screenplay) is set
around a tenement block of project houses during a garbage strike in the
mid-'70s where the streets are lined with bags of garbage, as she captures in a
beautifully significant way the pathos and squalor of slum life. </P>
<P>The film opens as an omen to death is presented, as a preadolescent boy named
Ryan is spinning his whole body around while he is wrapped around a lace window
curtain that resembles a shroud; the scene shifts from slo-mo to real time as
his mother angrily pulls him out of the curtain, and he runs outside to play in
the muddy canal--which is filled with vermin, but is the nearest thing to a park
the neighborhood kids have to play in. </P>
<P>Ryan meets James there and they get into a playful spat, and James accidently
drowns him and runs away. This sets the lugubrious tone for the film, as this
secret haunts him as he retreats into a world of solitude, bitter friendships, a
relationship with an older girl who is the neighborhood slut, and a strange
relationship with his family. He deems that the answer to his problem, is to
escape from the neighborhood by moving into a new home. </P>
<P>To make matters worst, as far as his guilt, the dead boy's mother (Jackie Quinn)
gives him her son's new shoes because he reminds her of her son. </P>
<P>The film paints a grim picture of his family, though it's certainly not the
worst family to raise kids. There's his father (Flanagan) who is usually drunk
or watching TV, which he's more interested in than he's in the kids; his earnest
ma (Matthews), who remembers when she used to dance joyfully to pop music but is
morosely overwhelmed by raising the family in a caring way; there's his
secretive older sister (Stewart) who treats him with contempt; and, his bratty
younger sister, Ann Marie (Lynne Ramsay, Jr.), who will drop a dime on him to
her daddy without changing her innocent childlike expression. The family is
rooted in poverty and are trapped by their lack of ambition and education. </P>
<P>The film's most tender moment comes when James seeks comfort more than sex with
the neighborhood slut, Margaret Anne (Leanne Mullen), and he seems sated to just
clean the lice out of her hair and take a bath with her. They imitate in their
encounter what they think a contented married couple should be like. </P>
<P>This impressive debut film is visually very powerful, it has plenty of images to
relate to what's burning inside James. The camera follows James around town as
he hangs out with the more rugged older neighborhood boys, his daffy friend
Kenny who sends his pet mouse to the moon on a ballooon, or when we watch him as
he wanders across a yellow field to look at a new housing development site going
up while he dreams of living there. This audacious film seems like a nightmare,
or a dream that James can't wake up from. The result is a lyrical work that has
a numbing affect because of its sparseness and tight images; it's a film of high
quality. </P>
