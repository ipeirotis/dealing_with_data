                           WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN              
                        A Film Review by Scott Renshaw 
                         Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw </PRE>
<P>Starring:  Andy Garcia, Meg Ryan, Lauren Tom, Tina Majorino. 
Screenplay:  Ronald Bass and Al Franken.
Director:  Luis Mandoki.</P>
<P>     This is the contradiction of WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN:  as
impressed as I was with most of its parts, I kept coming up with 
better ways to piece them together.  It's that rare film that pulls 
very few punches in its examination of a family in crisis, but there 
is a schizophrenia in the perspective.  There are some extremely 
effective performances, but director Luis Mandoki shows us far too 
much from the perspective of the alcoholic character.  Ultimately 
there is more right than there is wrong with WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN, 
yet is also makes choices which are more safe than they are 
appropriate.</P>
<P>     Michael (Andy Garcia) and Alice (Meg Ryan) are a San Francisco
couple who, in the parlance, "seem to have it all."  Michael is an 
airline pilor, and Alice a school counselor; they have a lovely home, 
two daughters (Tina Majorino, Mae Whitman) and an au pair (Lauren 
Tom).  They also have a problem:  Alice is an alcoholic. The problem 
seems "under control" until two close calls froce the Greens to 
confront the situation.  As Alice goes into rehab, Michael is left to 
hold the family together.  But that might be even harder than it first 
appears, as the lack of social lubricant exposes cracks in Michael and 
Alice's relationship, and the time comes for hard decisions.</P>
<P>     WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN is grounded in two expertly developed
characters, well-acted by Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan.  Michael is the 
consummate co-dependant, blinding himself to Alice's alcoholism 
because it's easier and more satisfying for him to play the problem- 
solver.  He doesn't respect Alice, and a couple of great scenes 
demonstrate how he treats her like one of his children.  Most 
effective are scenes where Michael realizes that the girls, who are 
always around when he is off on a trip, are much more aware of what is 
going on than he is.  Ryan is solid as the fragile and frightened 
Alice, and plays a very restrained drunk.  She also makes a believable 
transition after her detox, leading into a fine bit of acting in a 
counseling session.  The big showdown between Michael and Alice is 
completely raw and very compelling, and Garcia and Ryan have 
tremendous chemistry.</P>
<P>     The problem is that WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN doesn't commit to
its point of view.  I felt this was essentially the story of the 
family's response to and discovery of the extent of Alice's problem, 
and not the story of Alice and her recovery.  Consequently, I wasn't 
bothered by the slickness of the production, because it fit with 
Michael's lack of awareness of what was going on beneath the surface.  
But then Mandoki and screenwriters Ronald Bass and Al Franken seem to 
want it both ways, showing us Alice sneaking into the street for a 
drink, or in the middle of a case of the DT's.  When the nuts and 
bolts of Alice's addiction were given the spotlight, the polish seemed 
inappropriate.  I wanted all of our discoveries about Alice to come as 
Michael discovered them (like well-handled scenes of Alice comforting 
a friend from rehab out of our hearing), so that I didn't feel Ryan 
was just being given showy scenes because she's a star.  A focus on 
Michael would have mad this a very different film from most films 
about substance abuse, but WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN retreats into the 
obvious.</P>
<P>     One key element of WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN which bears
specific mention is the dynamic performance of Tina Majorino as eldest 
daughter Jess.  The child of Alice's first marriage, Jess brings a 
host of abandonment issues to the table, and a worldliness beyond her 
years which still seems very real.  Majorino's eyes are filled with 
profound sadness, and her reactions to Alice's final washout are 
stunning.  It was moments like her last scene with Garcia which 
finally brought me to tears, and convinced me that there should have 
been more family moments.  The original title of WHEN A MAN LOVES A 
WOMAN was SIGNIFICANT OTHER, but it really should have been 
SIGNIFICANT OTHERS.  When it lost sight of the others affected by 
alcoholism, it missed the chance to be truly special.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 significant others:  6.</PRE>
