<P>     If you decide to see THE SPITFIRE GRILL, bring a handkerchief.  Or, 
better yet, make that a whole box of tissues.  The only dry eyes at the 
end of the film will belong to movie-goers who recognize writer/director 
Lee David Zlotoff's gauche and shameless manipulation.  Cynic that I am, 
I left the theater dry-eyed, realizing that, had Zlotoff not been moved 
to inject overblown melodrama into this simple character-based piece, 
THE SPITFIRE GRILL could have been an enjoyable little picture.  By 
failing to curb certain excesses, Zlotoff damages the film's emotional 
balance.</P>
<P>     It's understandable why this motion picture took the audience award 
at this year's Sundance Film Festival, especially when you consider the 
fete's growing commercial tendencies.  With THE SPITFIRE GRILL, if you 
don't think too hard about what's going on, it's easy to be drawn in by 
the film's apparent sincerity.  The movie pushes all the right buttons, 
and viewers inevitably react.  However, the bottom line is that, while 
THE SPITFIRE GRILL is a tearjerker, it's too clumsily-constructed to be 
considered a skillful one.  </P>
<P>     Actually, the movie follows up a strong start with a solid middle.  
It's only in the last half-hour that things start to go bad.  It's as if 
Zlotoff, not knowing how to end the story, decided that the easiest way 
to tie up loose ends was to go for the quick, cheap way out.  The 
concluding quarter of THE SPITFIRE GRILL contains a few too many 
contrivances -- missing money, a "surprise" revelation (which is 
anything but unexpected), white water rafting without the raft, and an 
"emotional" speech that strikes the wrong chord.</P>
<P>      The Spitfire Grill is the only place to grab a bite in the small 
town of Gilead, Maine -- the North's answer to FRIED GREEN TOMATOES' 
Whistle Stop Cafe.  With her bad leg, the proprietress, Hannah Ferguson 
(Ellen Burstyn), is finding the Grill progressively more difficult to 
run.  So, when the sheriff comes to her with an offer of help, she 
reluctantly agrees.  Her new waitress/kitchen worker is named Percy 
Talbot (Alison Elliott), and she's an ex-con, having just been released 
from Windham Prison after serving a five-year term for manslaughter.  </P>
<P>     When Hannah suffers an incapacitating injury, Percy is forced to 
take over the day-to-day operation of the Grill.  Since she's a terrible 
cook, she's grateful for the help of a local woman, Shelby Goddard 
(Marcia Gay Harden), who's a godsend in the kitchen.  Shelby's bitter 
husband, Nahum (Will Patton), is far less helpful, however.  Convinced 
that Percy means no good, he'd like nothing better than to run her out 
of town.  Meanwhile, a mysterious watcher in the woods lurks around the 
Grill by night, coming into the open only to collect a bag of canned 
goods that Hannah leaves outside for him.</P>
<P>     As a character study of Percy, THE SPITFIRE GRILL works.  Although 
parts of her past are painted with broad strokes, she is fleshed out 
with amazing aptitude by actress Alison Elliot (the "woman left behind" 
in THE UNDERNEATH), who's easily the best thing about this movie.  
Elliot's performance keeps us involved for nearly the entire film, and 
almost gets us through the turbulence of THE SPITFIRE GRILL's 
dissatisfying climax.</P>
<P>     Playing roles that are variations of familiar stereotypes, none of 
Elliot's co-stars are especially noteworthy.  Ellen Burstyn is the 
crusty old woman with a good heart who hides a terrible, tragic secret.  
Marcia Gay Harden is the meek wife who finds a backbone as a result of 
her association with Percy.  And Will Patton is the hard-hearted cynic 
who distrusts the newcomer from the moment that she sets food in Gilead.  
Burstyn's performance is robust, and Harden is effectively pathetic 
(despite the uneven accent), but Patton's unsubtle, unsympathetic 
portrayal is unfortunate.</P>
<P>     There are numerous similarities between THE SPITFIRE GRILL and 
FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, but, while both movies shamelessly go for the 
tearducts, Jon Avnet's 1992 feature has a level of emotional honesty 
that's missing here.  I wanted very much to like THE SPITFIRE GRILL, in 
large part because Alison Elliot made me care about Percy, and, for the 
better part of ninety minutes, I was willing to forgive the movie its 
few, mostly small, narrative problems.  Unfortunately, those flaws 
multiply at an alarming rate as the end draws near, and I left the 
theater feeling somewhat let down.  THE SPITFIRE GRILL isn't a bad 
movie, but, like Percy's breakfast special, certain overdone portions 
are difficult to digest.</P>
