<PRE>                             THE EVENING STAR
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     For those of you who have been waiting for the sequel to that
quintessential tearjerker and excellent movie TERMS OF ENDEARMENT
(1983), it is finally finished.  Called THE EVENING STAR, it is a
disaster.</P>
<P>     Shirley MacLaine is back as Aurora Greenway, but her humanity is
gone and only her humorous side remains.  The script is by the director
Robert Harding, and all his jokes fall like stones.  So what is good in
the film?</P>
<P>     In almost a cameo part at the end Jack Nicholson returns as
astronaut Garrett Breedlove.  His performance is fairly mechanical, but
infinitely better than the rest of the film.  The only other positive
aspects of the picture worth mentioning are the classic tacky clothes
that the costume designer created for Aurora.  They consist of
combinations of purples and pale blues accentuated with silly little
frills.  I have now exhaustively listed every good part of the film.
Do not bother looking for any others.  There are none.</P>
<P>     Set in Houston in 1988, the show contains a cacophony of bad Texas
accents, but the worst is Miranda Richardson's as Aunt Patsy.  She has
cliched lines including, "I'm just a poor little old Texas gal.  Struck
oil at the altar."  We even get a tour of her Imelda Marcos sized
walk-in closet.</P>
<P>     Winning the award for the worse performance in the film is Bill
Paxton as Aurora's therapist Jerry.  Poor Bill looks as though he
suffers from gas through most of the film.  I hope he has gotten to
feel better.  There is a unbelievable romance between Jerry and Aurora.
The romance is little more than a plot device inserted in a failed
attempt to shock the audience.  You see, Aurora is old enough to be
Jerry's mother.</P>
<P>     Usually interesting Juliette Lewis plays Aurora's granddaughter.
I just knew she would be able to make something out of her badly
written part, but she wasn't.</P>
<P>     The show is full of bad taste masquerading as comedy.  Patsy's
doorbell plays "The Yellow Rose of Texas."  Now, that is an original
idea.  When a sweet old character dies in the middle of the show, the
director peppers the funeral with little sight gags.  We can not even
bury the dead properly in this show.  Believe it or not, there is even
a airplane food fight between Aurora and Patsy.  Is the world ready for
TERMS OF ENDEARMENT meets ANIMAL HOUSE?</P>
<P>     Child actor Shawn Taylor Thompson plays Aurora's obnoxious
great-grandson Bump.  They cut away when he talks, and it sounds as if
they are using an adult to talk like a funny toddler.  Bad taste
abounds in this picture.</P>
<P>     The ending comes totally out of left field, but I guess I should
not have been surprised.  If it weren't for being a critic, I would
have been spared the ending.  There is no reason to stay if for some
reason you find yourself watching this movie.  Vote with your feet.
And vote early.  I wish I could have.</P>
<P>     THE EVENING STAR runs way too long at about 2:10.  It is rated
PG-13.  There are sexual situations, but no sex, nudity, or violence.
The language is much worse than it needed to be and had several uses of
the F word.  The film would probably be okay for kids 10 and up, but
why bother?  I recommend you stay as far away from this film as
possible.  This being the Christmas season, I am going to be charitable
and give it a single *.  My brain told me to give it less.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
