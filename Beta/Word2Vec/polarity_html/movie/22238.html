<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This seemingly laconic B&W pseudodocumentary-styled noir film, with a
patriotic message supporting the U.S. war effort in Korea and offering a
scathing commentary on counterfeiters, comparing them to saboteurs, as
the film states the most powerful weapon in America's arsenal against
Communism- is money, turns out to be basically a promotional movie for
the work that the Treasury Department agents do.</P>
<P>Southside is directed and written by Boris Ingster, who directed the
first American noir film, "Stranger on the Third Floor" (40). In this
film, he never brings about any tension or real shock to the story, as
he did in his first noir work. He simply goes about stating his case
against a master counterfeiter, Eugene Deane (Morris Ankrum), who is
serving a life sentence in San Quentin, and tells how he was able while
in prison to engrave some plates of money currency and smuggle them out
of prison by fooling the prison chaplain (Spencer) and hiding it in the
liner of his bag.</P>
<P>The movie reminds me of the 1950s TV series, Dragnet. It is played in
the same sobering tone, with no room for comedy or any quirkiness to the
vanilla story unfolding. In the end, it is a certainty that everything
will be wrapped up in a tidy manner.</P>
<P>Deane has gotten religion while in jail and is considered to be a model
prisoner, perhaps making peace with his maker because he is very ill and
about to die soon. So it seems strange that he would be interested in
still pursuing his criminal activities, especially since money can't be
of use to him anymore. In his cell, he is always seen with his Bible,
and he is quite fond of showing off his knowledge of the scriptures,
even correcting the padre on one of his sermons about money being the
root of evil, as he tells the padre, St. Paul in his epistle said, it is
the love of money that is the root of evil, not money itself.</P>
<P>A bunco cop working the beat in an unnamed baseball park, which looked
to me like Yankee Stadium (but the story takes place in Los
Angeles-which goes to show you how widespread the counterfeit money
operation is), spots a pickpocket (Harmon), and when arrested the cops
realize that this is "queer money." The secret service is informed about
this and they put a tail on the man who was pickpocketed, the traveling
salesman, Mr.Evans (Barry Kelley). He leads them to a smoke shop where
he exchanges good money for counterfeit ones, and the secret service
arrest the smoke shop owners and Evans. Federal agent John Riggs (Don
DeFore) now tails Evans when he is out on bond, who is facing a 10-year
sentence if convicted. But when a trap is set for Evans to meet his
contact man, a wily criminal, Reggie (Tobias), the criminals lose the
cop's tail and the cop's pigeon is thrown out of a window, and there
goes the best lead that they had.</P>
<P>But Riggs goes undercover, using the name Nick Starns as he checks into
a hotel that he knows Evans frequents. He poses as an underworld figure
and a bank robber, and catches the attention of the hotel manager, Nora
Craig (Andrea King). They get to know each other and soon become
romantically and professionally linked together, though she suspects
that he might be a cop and has him watched by Reggie.</P>
<P>To make a short story shorter, she's the daughter of Deane and the big
boss of the syndicate. When Deane escapes from prison to see her, after
he dies, she looks through his belongings and recognizes a sketch her
father made of Riggs, depicting him as a T-agent. Since her boys are in
the middle of a counterfeit deal with Starns, she goes to warn them that
he's a copper.</P>
<P>The climax shows Nora to be a real bitch, as she doesn't hesitate for a
second to give Reggie an order to kill Riggs. He was outwitted by the
ever-careful Reggie, who foiled any attempt at being followed to the
gang's building where the deal was to go down, but Riggs was smart
enough to have a $10 bill with an emergency message and the number SO
1-1000 of the local secret service agency on it, which was used to pay
for the beer he ordered in a grocery store, and he was lucky enough to
have the immigrant grocer's wife who looked at the bill, call the
agency.</P>
<P>The agents arrive in time to rescue Riggs from being burned to death and
arrest all the criminals, but for Nora, who runs into the downtown area
and across a trestle and slips to her death onto the railroad tracks
below. Her embrace of hatred for him on the trestle is contrasted to
their loving embrace in her apartment. This final scene was filmed
aboard Los Angeles' "Angel's Flight," a cable-car service dangling 40
feet above the ground.</P>
<PRE>The film was based on a true story, and seems as if it were a
documentary.</PRE>
