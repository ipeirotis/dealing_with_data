                       A film review by Scott Renshaw

<P>     Miramax is marketing INTO THE WEST as a "family film," and while
it's admirable to do so, I'm not sure it's the best idea.  On the one
hand, the deliberate pace appeared to lose the children in the audience
when I saw the film.  On the other, adults without children tend to
stay away from "family films," and that would be a shame.  INTO THE
WEST is a charming, wise and gentle film that shows enough confidence
to build slowly to a satisfying climax.</P>
<P>     INTO THE WEST is the story of two Irish youngsters,
twelve-year-old Tito Reilley (Ruaidhri Conroy) and his eight-year-old
brother Ossie (Ciaran Fitzgerald).  Raised among the nomadic
Travellers, the boys are brought to Dublin by their widowed Papa
(Gabriel Byrne), a hard drinker dealing with his wife's death by
removing himself from his past.  On the day they arrive in Dublin,
there is another new arrival:  a fantastic white stallion called Tir na
nOg (Gaelic for "land of eternal youth") who attaches himself to
Ossie.  When authorities discover the horse in the Reilley's flat, they
remove it and sell it off to a nasty horse breeder (John Kavanagh) who
turns Tir na nOg into a champion show jumper.  The two boys, however,
have other ideas, and decide to free the horse, becoming fugitives in
the process.</P>
<P>     I spent the first half hour or so of INTO THE WEST a bit edgy and
uninvolved, but it slowly began to occur to me that there might be an
intentional reason.  The scenes set in Dublin are dark and
claustrophobic, but as the action spreads into the Irish countryside
the film takes on a lyrical majesty.  INTO THE WEST juxtaposes the
mundane modernism represented by the city with the mythical wonder of
the Old Ireland, shown as both the boys and Papa travel into the
untamed West.  It's a theme similar to the one director Mike Newell
explored in his last film, 1992's ENCHANTED APRIL:  the lifting of
spirit caused by removing oneself from the city.  While INTO THE WEST
is not quite as successful overall, there is still a quiet grace to the
visual narrative, thanks to cinematographer Tom Sigel's beautiful
photography of hills and coastlines.</P>
<P>     The performances are not quite as engaging as the look of the
film.  Gabriel Byrne, as the dour and laconic Papa, doesn't carry off
his emotional scenes particularly well.  David Kelley is crusty but
basically cliche as the boys Old World grandfather, and Ellen Barkin,
Byrne's real-life wife, has a bland role as a Traveller who helps Papa
search for the boys.  Fortunately, the two young newcomers who carry
the film are better.  Ruaidhri Conroy is sharp and good-natured as the
protective older brother, if at times a bit affected.  Ciaran
Fitzgerald, however, is a scene-stealing charmer with great comic
sensibility.  The two are just right as brothers, and their scenes
together are light and well-directed.</P>
<P>     If Jim Sheridan's script is a bit thin, it's because the story is
secondary to the feel of the film.  The villainous horse breeder and
his police-officer henchman are perfunctory characters; the story might
have been done just as well without them.  I also thought the portrayal
of the Travellers was underdeveloped, but I'll admit that's because
I've studied Celtic folklore and wanted to see more.  Still, I never
really minded the lack of depth because the mystical tone seemed right
on.</P>
<P>     I noted earlier that INTO THE WEST was less successful as afilm
for children, and that assessment comes simply from listening.  If
you've ever seen a movie with an audience comprised largely of
children, you know that you get a minute-by-minute account of what they
think about it.  One girl said to her mother, "I don't know what he's
saying;" it seems the Irish accents were a problem.  An older boy said
simply, "Nothing's happening."  While hardly a scientific test, these
and other comment seemed to suggest that young ones without long
attention spans might be less than enthralled.</P>
<P>     INTO THE WEST may be, as my young audience-mate noted, a film
where "nothing's happening."  It's not a rollicking adventure, or a
HOME ALONE-style comedy.  However, for anyone with a taste for rich
atmosphere spiced with a touch of magic might be pleasantly surprised.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 magic stallions:  7.</PRE>
