<PRE>                               FOR LOVE OR MONEY
                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     Doug Ireland (Michael J. Fox) is the concierge at an upscale New
York hotel, where his attention to the guests sometimes goes beyond the
call of mere duty as he plays the role of a "genie is a suit", helping
them realize their less grand dreams.  But Doug has a dream of his
own--building the "ultimate" hotel--and all he needs is a $3 million
investment from super-rich tycoon Christian Hanover (Anthony Higgins).
Hanover seems interested, but first he wants Doug to babysit his
mistress, Andy Hart (Gabrielle Anwar).  At first, Doug has no trouble
with the task, but as he begins to fall for Andy, he realizes that he
may have to make the choice between the girl and the dream.</P>
<P>     "Cute" is the operative word to describe FOR LOVE OR MONEY, and
there are numerous times when this picture takes cuteness to an
extreme.  It's nice when a movie gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling deep
inside, but too much sweetness can turn sickening.  FOR LOVE OR MONEY
has its moments, but it's debatable whether there are enough of them to
justify the movie's existence.</P>
<P>     Michael J. Fox and Gabrielle Anwar make a good pair, and there's a
decent rapport between them, but the script fails to take full
advantage of the chemistry.  Despite the amount of screen time that
they share, the development of their romance is fitful and incomplete.
For a romantic comedy, this is a serious flaw, and it makes the
inevitable conclusion less satisfying than it should be.  For those who
enjoy this sort of lighthearted, frothy boy-meets-girl sparring, last
year's THE CUTTING EDGE is a far better choice.</P>
<P>     There are a number of seemingly unnecessary subplots going on, the
inclusion of which damages the early pace of the movie.  When the
audience wants to see more Michael J. Fox/Gabrielle Anwar interaction,
they are instead treated to Doug trying to duck the earstwhile,
seemingly-incorruptible IRS agent Drinkwater (Bob Balaban).
Admittedly, things get tied together in the end, but the conclusion is
so feeble that it doesn't warrant all of the excess garbage that leads
up to it.</P>
<P>     There are a number of charming scenes sprinkled throughout FOR
LOVE OR MONEY, most of which feature the delicately growing
relationship between Doug and Andy.  There's also a very funny mistaken
identity incident that shows the promise of a more enjoyable film than
the one we're presented with.</P>
<P>     The ending, in addition to being unaccountably rushed (the movie
weighs in at a light 95 minutes, so there's no obvious reason for
things to be truncated so suddenly), is disappointing in its
unoriginality.  Since this is basically a modern-day fairy tale, we
know everything is going to turn out right--in fact, we'd be
disappointed if it didn't--but the manner in which things are smoothly
resolved is far from satisfying.</P>
<P>     This is one of Michael J. Fox's better film performances (put it
alongside his BACK TO THE FUTURE and DOC HOLLYWOOD roles).  The movie
itself isn't that great, but Fox is affable, and seems the perfect
choice for Doug.  Gabrielle Anwar, who had a quick scene in SCENT OF A
WOMAN and a much larger role in WILD HEARTS CAN'T BE BROKEN, is a
refreshing as Andy, perfecting a breezy attitude.  Unfortunately for
Ms. Anwar, she is forced to wear a number of too-tight outfits whose
presence indicates that sex appeal is one of her main functions of her
part.</P>
<P>     Romantic comedies have become something of a scarce breed of late,
and this is a prime example of why (there's an old saying that if you
can't do something right, don't do it at all).  Although FOR LOVE OR
MONEY is a marginal film by any standards, it isn't unwatchable, and it
does fit nicely into the "date movie" niche.  I can't honestly
recommend the movie, but it isn't completely without redeeming
qualities.</P>
