<P>     Move over, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS!  COPYCAT has usurped the position
at the top of the all-time serial killer movie heap.  With its rare
mixture of intelligent plotting, flawless acting, and start-to-finish
tension, COPYCAT is a force to be reckoned with--hopefully both at the
box office and when Oscars are given out next spring.  It amazes me that
an entry from this genre, which is normally known for pointless gore and
contrived storylines (see--or rather don't see--DON'T TALK TO
STRANGERS), has turned out a motion picture this keen and complex.</P>
<P>     COPYCAT opens in a college lecture hall.  Dr. Helen Hudson
(Sigourney Weaver), a psychiatrist who specializes in serial killers, is
giving a talk on her pet subject.  Her words drive home the point:
these people get turned on by what they do.  They feel no remorse--only
anticipation of the next kill.  After finishing the seminar, Helen heads
for the restrooms, where she comes face-to-face with Daryll Lee Cullem
(Harry Connick Jr.), a man with murderous intentions who has been
stalking her.</P>
<P>     Thirteen months later, Helen is an agoraphobiac recovering from a
nervous breakdown.  She hides inside her apartment, connected to the
Internet while downing pills and booze in roughly equal quantities.
She's useless to herself or anyone else.  Then the police, led by Mary
Jane Monahan (Holly Hunter) and Reuben Goetz (Dermot Mulroney), arrive
at her door.  They need help tracking a serial killer who has been
terrorizing young women in the San Francisco area, and who better to go
to than an expert with 20 years of having "serial killers on the brain"?
Although at first reluctant, Helen eventually relents and lends her
experience to the investigation.  Her first contribution is to identify
the killer as a copycat.  He is mimicking the great serial killers--the
Boston Strangler, Son of Sam, the Hillside Strangler, Dahmer, and
Bundy--and there's no way to tell who or how he will murder next.  On
top of everything, he has decided to play Internet games with Helen, the
"Muse of Serial Killers."</P>
<P>     It's a difficult task to perfect this sort of story.  There are so
many areas where the script can fail that it's astounding how seamlessly
COPYCAT overcomes all obstacles.  There are no stupid characters,
contrived resolutions, or deus ex machinas.  The police are smart, but
so is the killer.  And the movie doesn't play games with the villain's
identity--we aren't left wondering whether he's one of the supposed
"good guys."  Like SEVEN, COPYCAT isn't concerned with whodunnit, but
why they did it and how they will strike next.  In contrast to the Brad
Pitt/Morgan Freeman movie, however, this picture has a rock-solid
storyline with no gaping holes in logic.</P>
<P>     I've never been a big fan of Sigourney Weaver, but what she
accomplishes here is impressive.  I can't help wonder how much better
DEATH AND THE MAIDEN would have been had she turned in a similar caliber
performance there.  From the opening scene in COPYCAT, Weaver has a good
sense of Dr. Hudson, and she holds onto the character through all the
emotional ups and downs.  This is doubtlessly the actresses' best work
to date.</P>
<P>     Holly Hunter, following her Oscar-winning mute role in THE PIANO,
shows her range by doing something radically different.  Strong-willed,
tough, and extremely competent, her MJ Monahan is the kind of smart,
multi-layered role actors relish, and Hunter is on target with her
portrayal.  This is a contained, dynamic performance without a hint of
overacting.  In many ways, what the actress does here exceeds what she
managed in Jane Campion's New Zealand period drama.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast is solid.  Dermot Mulroney projects a likable
cockiness as Monahan's partner.  Harry Connick Jr. is creepy as Hudson's
stalker.  While no Hannibal the Cannibal, Connick's Daryll Lee is still
a frighteningly demented man.  Equally disturbing is William McNamara as
the title character, one of the most chilling since Michael Rooker's
lead in HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER.</P>
<P>     The worst thing that can happen in a movie like this is for the
characters to be a step behind the audience.  That's not the case in
COPYCAT, where the viewer is in synch with what's occurring on-screen.
Tension and atmosphere are excellent, and director Jon Amiel pays
careful attention to detail.  Parts of this film are frightening, and
will have many viewers either on the edge of their seat or hiding their
eyes.  And, unlike in many so-called thrillers, the ending is not a let-
down.  Comparisons with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS are inevitable, but this
movie is no mere copycat of Jonathan Demme's 1991 feature--it's a
well-crafted improvement.</P>
