Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     I don't blame Paul Schrader for thinking he could get away with
voice-over narration where so many others had failed.  After all, he did
set the standard for ideal use of the device when he let us into the mind
of Travis Bickle in TAXI DRIVER.  Every once in a while, a talented writer
will figure out just when he can get away with the narration crutch, and
for what purpose.  Schrader forgot those things while adapting Russell
Banks' AFFLICTION.  Working with all the elements for a raw dramatic
masterwork, he appears unclear how to tell the story through to its
conclusion.  And in a fit of panic, he turns the final minutes of the film
into a mess of ham-fisted plot summary and perplexing epilogue.</P>
<P>     It's a crying shame, because the set-up for AFFLICTION is so utterly
compelling.  Nick Nolte stars as Wade Whitehouse, a lifetime resident of a
small New Hampshire town.  Recently divorced, Wade spends his days as a
civil servant -- running the snowplow and serving as crossing guard --
while also acting as the town's lone part-time cop.  He's trying to put
his life back together, even beginning a new relationship with a long-time
friend named Marge (Sissy Spacek), but his life has been permanently
scarred by his abusive, alcoholic Pop (James Coburn).  The death of his
mother brings Wade back into his father's house, rekindling long-buried
emotions just when his suspicions of foul play in a recent hunting
accident have him on edge.</P>
<P>     The heart, soul and twisted guts of AFFLICTION lie in Nick Nolte's
performance as Wade, as beaten-down a human being as the screen has ever
seen without turning him into a "lovable loser."  Whipped into a
psychological submission by his Pop, Wade crawls through life on his belly
-- working menial jobs at the whim of a town Selectman (Holmes Osborne),
feared and abandoned by his ex-wife and daughter because he has abandoned
them emotionally, taunted by a wealthy man to whom he tries to serve a
traffic ticket.  Afraid of turning out anything like his father, Wade
absorbs every bit of pain for fear that releasing it will cause him to
lose control.  He's tragic and pathetic and doomed, and Nolte nails him.</P>
<P>     Schrader, on the other hand, doesn't seem convinced that he has
nailed Wade.  The film opens with narration by Wade's younger brother
Rolfe (Willem Dafoe), narration which appears at irregular intervals.
Initially, the narration is simply florid and unnecessary; later, it
begins to repeat entire scenes just completed, as though afraid we might
have just walked in from the lobby and missed something.  Finally, the
narration becomes absolutely insufferable, summing up every theme from the
previous two hours in a few tidy sentences that makes you wonder why you
spent your time with Wade instead of his self-appointed shrink.  That
narration is part of an attrocious conclusion that nearly ruins the film,
tagging on explanations of much that has gone before and some that comes
after.  Either Schrader ran out of money to show us all this significant
material, or he ran out of ideas regarding how to do it.  </P>
<P>     Perhaps such a gaping hole in the resolution of the protagonist's
story should have ruined the film, but there's too much else that works in
AFFLICTION.  Cinematographer Paul Sarossy, who captured Russell Banks'
winter mindscapes previously in THE SWEET HEREAFTER, captures a sense of
chilly isolation, and the supporting cast -- notably Coburn's casually
emasculating turn as Pop -- is solid top to bottom.  There's an ache at
the core of AFFLICTION as painful as the rotting tooth that, in a
Shakespearean display of psychic corruption manifested through physical
corruption, torments Wade through much of the film.  There will also be an
ache in the head of many viewers, as Schrader spends the film's critical
final minutes beating them with a Moral to the Story that anyone able to
add single-digit numbers should comprehend unassisted.  It may have worked
for Travis Bickle, but here Schrader's use of narration nearly trumps
Nolte's triumph.  It's enough to make an edgy critic ask, "Are you _still_
talkin' to me?"</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 winter overkills:  6.</PRE>
