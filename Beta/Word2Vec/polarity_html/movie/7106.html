<P>     Before SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW, the last time director Bille August
gut hold of a mysterious, best-selling novel was 1994's THE HOUSE OF THE
SPIRITS.  If that thought doesn't send a shudder of dread through you at
the prospects for SMILLA, you were probably fortunate enough to miss THE
HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS.  SPIRITS was a disastrous combination of mis-guided
casting and even more mis-guided story-telling, and it lost all sense of
Isabel Allende's magical realism.  Peter Hoeg's _Froken Smillas
Fornemmelse for Sne_ (Miss Smillas' Feeling for Snow) presented a
similarly challenging combination of atmosphere, character and plot, and
August, but this time around he has been much more faithful to the source
material.  Unfortunately, the result still isn't a particularly good film.
As tense and evocative as SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is during its first hour,
it shares the fundamental flaw of the novel:  a strange plot device which
may leave you wondering if you've just seen "The X-Files" movie.</P>
<P>     Julia Ormond stars as Smilla Jaspersen, an arctic researcher living
in Copenhagen, Denmark.  A woman of Greenlandic Inuit descent who has
never felt comfortable in Denmark, Smilla has lived a life closed off from
all other people, with the exception of a young Inuit boy named Isaiah
(Clipper Miano) who lives in her apartment building.  That one friendship
is shattered when Isaiah is found dead on the sidewalk outside the
building, the victim of an apparent accidental fall from the roof.  But
Smilla has a special sense of snow, and her instincts tell her that
Isaiah's death was no accident -- he was running from something before he
fell to his death.  As Smilla investigates with the help of a neighbor
(Gabriel Byrne), she finds herself in the middle of a conspiracy which
will lead her back to the beautiful desolation of her icy homeland.</P>
<P>     You'd never expect a film with the plot I just described based on the
first scene in SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW.  It shows a 19th century Inuit ice
fisherman rudely interrupted from his labors by a crashing meteorite,
which proceeds to create a tidal wave of crushed ice sufficient to supply
the planet with daquiris for several decades.  The moment is spectacular,
but when the scene suddenly shifts to modern Copenhagen and the film
becomes a dark, moody mystery, you might wonder whether you've just had an
out-of-genre experience.  More to the point, you might fear that August
has snapped his cap.</P>
<P>     Actually, August is simply preparing the audience for the radical
shift still to come, a shift which wasn't nearly as radical in Hoeg's
novel.  For about three-quarters of its length, SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW is
a fairly compelling character study anchored by a strong lead performance.
Julia Ormond may be a bit young for Hoeg's Smilla, but she makes the
character her own with an unapologetic toughness uncommon in female screen
characters.  Smilla's relationship with the neglected Isaiah is skillfully
established in flashbacks, and though Smilla is not a particularly
pleasant person her loyalty and determination win the audience over to her
side.  Screenwriter Ann Biderman has done a fine job of paring down the
novel's often-cumbersome plot and its glut of conspirators, allowing the
focus to stay squarely on Smilla and her relationships.  Ormond's
performance and August's direction capture Hoeg's lyrical, haunting
psychological drama, a style reminiscent of _The English Patient_ author
Michael Ondaatje.</P>
<P>     But then there's that third act, and there's nothing August, Biderman
or anyone else can do about SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW's unexpected
metamorphosis from Michael Ondaatje to Michael Crichton except take it all
the way overboard.  The Greenland-based climax includes some splendid
landscapes by cinematographer Jorgen Persson, and the arctic vastness
suggests the coming of a resolution with an internal dimension -- Smilla
coming to terms with her life, her land and her heritage.</P>
<P>     Well, the resolution is internal, all right, only it's the interior
of an ice cave, where villainous industrialist Andreas Tork (Richard
Harris) is up to no good with some mutant parasitic worms and the same
meteorite which spoiled the day of our old friend the ice fisherman a
hundred years and five reels earlier.  The finale is so utterly bizarre --
and so unsatisfying -- that it taints the entire two hour experience of
SMILLA'S SENSE OF SNOW.  Perhaps Bille August needs to choose something
simple for his next project, a story which doesn't begin as an emotional
journey and end as a cross between a James Bond film and THE BLOB.</P>
