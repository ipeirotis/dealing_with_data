<P>GO (director: Doug Liman; cast: Desmond Askew (Simon Baines), Taye Diggs
(Marcus), William Fichtner (Burke), J.E. Freeman (Victor Sr.), Katie
Holmes (Claire Montgomery), Jay Mohr (Zack), Timothy Olyphant (Todd
Gaines), Sarah Polley (Ronna Martin), Scott Wolf (Adam), Breckin Meyer
(Tiny), 1999)</P>
<P>A zippy youth oriented Christmas movie (though there is no Bing singing
White Christmas in this one) marketed for the druggie generation of
post-teens and those in their late 20s, that is perhaps a cut above the
rest of the mindless offerings flooding the market to capture filmland's
largest share of ticket buyers, as it tells its somewhat derivative
black comic tale, (PULP FICTION type dialogue and style), fuelled by the
originality of its accelerated pace, using the cool life-style in LALA
land as its backdrop, and telling about its main characters who either
work in a supermarket or are involved small time in using or pushing
pills.</P>
<P>GO is made up of three interconnected stories, which are told in
different versions from the point where Ronna (Polley ), as the
supermarket cashier strapped for rent money, about to be evicted on
Christmas Eve, is on the phone, as her fellow supermarket cashier, the
Britisher, Simon (Desmond), who needs to go to Las Vegas with his mates,
makes Ronna an offer, giving her his pay up front, if she takes his
shift at work.</P>
<P>The first story is about Ronna, who shows some spunk, interacting with
her fellow workers by playing a funny kind of guess the celebrity game
while on a break, but is quickly dislodged into reality when the manager
tells her the break is over, and she is back at work filling in for
Simon, after finishing her 14- hour shift. In this frenetically paced
film, the innovative young director, Doug Liman, following his indie
debut feature, SWINGERS, shows that he has a feel for these young people
and their problematic world, as he grapples with their realities, giving
us a good look at how they view themselves, their job and their
customers. On Ronna's check out line are two good-looking guys,
appearing to be swish, to the dismay of one of Ronna's cashier
girlfriends, Claire (Katie), as these two, Adam (Scott Wolf) and Zack
(Jay Mohr), ask for Simon, and quickly let on that he is their drug
supplier, while telling Ronna they will deal with her because they need
the stuff, immediately, for a party. This gives Ronna some ideas that
she can do the deal herself  by going to Simon's supplier, Todd
(Olyphant); but, he tells her she needs all the money up front to make
the deal. From there on, what can go wrong for her, does. The most
amusing bit, is that we see her pushing aspirins and sinus pills as
substitutes for the hallucinogenic ectasy pill, at a party, where those
who are there, are so high already, they don't know the difference from
one pill to the other.</P>
<P>The second story is one that I must have seen a dozen times by now in
films, about the guys who go to Vegas, gamble over their head, get into
trouble, have a car chase, meet some gangsters and Vegas showgirls, and
have themselves a vacation they can't forget. What saves this story is
not the story, but the charm of the hapless Simon in Vegas, and the mood
set by the glitzy Vegas world of neon, that blends violence in with the
loud background music, as the bouncers chase after Simon and his
friends, all because Simon put his hands on a lap dancer and wounded the
bouncer who was pummeling him. But it is the very likable nature of
Simon's amusing friends, as they chatter away, one conversation has the
white Tiny (Breckin) telling the black Marcus (Taye), that race is a
state of mind, other conversations include one about Tantric sex, that
saves the day in Vegas.</P>
<P>The third and final story traces Adam and Zack, the two TV actors and
lovers, who got busted and are now wired to catch other drug offenders,
such as Simon and Ronna, with the promise by the weird undercover
officer in charge of them (Fichtner), that if they cooperate, they will
be let completely off the hook. I though Fichtner was the funniest and
most malevolent one in the film.</P>
<P>I don't think the film had much to say about much of anything, including
the use of drugs, but it hit hard at being an hilarious film, with its
fast-paced mood swings, its sharp editing cuts and frequent light
changes, allowing its story to be easy to watch, and imbuing the
characters with a certain attitude about them, that made their
performances seem eclectic. I especially liked Sarah Polley, when she
wasn't on the screen the film seemed to lack purpose.</P>
<P>In any case, GO has watch ability because of its raw energy, and the way
it was able to get inside a pill poppers head and to convey on screen
how hallucinatory his world looks when he is high. Yet the film for all
its innovative features, still could not escape, from being on the edge
of sitcom and not on the edge of innovative filmmaking. And the only
reason for calling it a Christmas story, is because it happens during
the holiday season, probably accurately showing how some generation
x'ers now spend their holidays. The film's appeal is still mostly with
the younger generation. They are the ones who are mostly likely to be
amused at how the main characters in the story comport themselves, while
the older generations might not be as amused, and feel put off by the
lack of any character depth or real wit in the story. And the benign
ending, not only didn't make sense, but seemed artificial and
embarrassing to watch. It was as if this film after using all its energy
in rebellion, now wants to conform and give the adults a happy ending.</P>
