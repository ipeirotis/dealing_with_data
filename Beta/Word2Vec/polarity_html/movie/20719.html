<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Stir of Echoes is firstly a ghost story and then it's a murder story,
taking place in a working class Chicago neighborhood, where the
neighbors party together and seem to be close-knit and concerned about
one another. In either case, writer/director David Koepp (writer of
Snake Eyes, The Lost World and director of The Trigger Effect) has come
up with an emotionally disturbing film.</P>
<P>Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is a telephone lineman and as a hobby plays
guitar for a rock band. He is down on himself for his life being so
ordinary, yet he tells his expectant wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) that he
is a happy man because he has her. One of their problems, is that their
5- year- old son Jake (Zachary David Cope) sees ghosts and carries out
conversations with them in a most peculiar fashion. He asks a
ghost,"Does it hurt to be dead?" If I were his dad I would have gotten
the kid some professional help before I attended another neighborhood
get together.</P>
<P>But this ghost story is about the ordeal of the most unlikely believer
in such supernatural tales, the hard-hat father of Jake, the one who has
always repressed his extra-ordinary visionary gift. Therefore the film
chooses not to focus too much on the precocious kid's gift, going almost
exclusively for his father's nightmarish visions to tell its tale.</P>
<P>Tom's common man persona will quickly change during one of those
gatherings, when his sister-in-law Lisa (Illeana Douglas), her sardonic
humor much appreciated by me, talks about hypnosis and the drunken and
skeptical Tom challenges the very amateur hypnotist to put him under. As
a result, the lesson being becomes: never play mind games you don't
understand with someone inexperienced and not completely reliable who
has you under their power. As it turns out, our man is a Receiver (which
in the supernatural trade, means that he has the gift, he could see
things in the other world). Tom is told to think of an empty theater,
with that in mind visions come to him very violently of some ill-doings
in the house he is renting, giving him the impression someone's buried
there. When out of the trance, he says he felt no pain and is surprised
when told he had a pin stuck in him. He remembers nothing of his visions
but still has x-ray vision and severe headaches and a foreboding fear
that he better do something about these visions or else his family will
be in danger. The next day when he turns to ask the kooky Lisa what she
did to him, she tells him she only suggested to him that he keep the
door open, to have an open mind.</P>
<P>He starts calling in sick to work, and his worried wife thinks he's
cracking-up. And even after he tells her what's going on inside his
head, she doesn't get it that this could be something requiring
professional help; she seems to be more concerned that he's used up all
his sick days. But the kid understands his father, they are now both on
the same wavelength and hold frequent chats together in private, afraid
that what they are talking about would scare mommy.</P>
<P>Tom is now obsessed with the vision of a ghost in the house, which he
soon identifies as a missing neighborhood teenager, Samantha Kozac
(Jenny). She is mentally retarded and the sister of Debbie (Liza Weil),
who babysits for Jake for only the first time at the suggestion of Jake.
Debbie's presence gets the ghost story really rolling, as Jake blurts
out to her his visions of Samantha being in the house. Though, at times,
the story is close to losing it, getting enveloped in melodramatics, it
manages to pull back and return to the family and their struggle with
the existence of a ghost in their house and their marital problems,
keeping the film suspenseful, allowing you to overlook if you care to,
the many holes in the story. It isn't until the climax that the film
really falls apart and reverts to a conventional ending, as it tries to
do justice to the murdered ghost. The film just lost control of what it
had going for it that made it different from, let's say, another recent
ghost film, The Sixth Sense, and plummeted it back into the world of the
run-of-the mill films of that genre.</P>
<P>When both father and son share ghostly visions of Samantha and the film
moves into the afterworld to tell its chilling story, the tale is
compelling. It is illustriously shot and its ghostly visions are
stunningly creepy. It also captures in its sights the good, bad, and
ugly of Chicago. This fast moving film has hooked onto the nuances of
its working class neighborhood completely, and by being grounded with
this kind of reality the ghost story becomes more effective.</P>
<P>>From this character driven film, we learn that ghosts get angry when we
don't respond to them properly. That the afterworld is a place that some
of us more than others have a chance to penetrate and if we do, we
better learn how to listen. Kevin Bacon plays the role convincingly,
with just the right amount of skepticism and psychological tension,
coming close but never going over the top, like a lesser actor might
have been tempted to do. Kathryn Erbe is solid in her role as the loving
wife who doesn't see what the rest of her family sees supernaturally but
in her own brave way tries to manage to keep the family together.
Zachary David Cope seems like a child who is used to seeing strange
things all his life and is rather placid and accepting about it, playing
his role as well as could be expected. But I did have some problems that
what was happening to him was not more fully developed. I felt I didn't
really know much more about him by the film's end than from its
beginning. In both sequences ghosts are communicating with him. I just
had the feeling that the kid could end up being a basket case if his
folks didn't take some time to help him deal with his gift, and that
even though they were hard working and nice people, they were not a very
perceptive couple.</P>
<P>What transpires is an ok ghost story, a suspenseful story of an ordinary
couple trying to cope with something that they are not prepared for, and
a weak murder story, that ruins the film, as it brings it down to earth
in a most desultory manner.</P>
<P>Is the film worth seeing? Yes. It is entertaining and spooky, and you
get taken on an emotional roller coaster ride. No. It is earthbound and
contrived, and the ending is a stinker. Take your pick, both answers are
correct.</P>
