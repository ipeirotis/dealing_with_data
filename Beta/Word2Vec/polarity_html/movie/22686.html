<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Tod Browning's (Dracula/The Unholy Three) outstanding film addresses the
point about watching a film such as this one, with a long-winded
rejoinder (this "crawl" was added to the film after its original release
by the producer who bought the film from MGM, Dwain Esper). It is
basically an apology to his audience for the freaks used in the film,
taking note of the usual revulsion most people have when they view the
abnormal, as he points out that the majority of freaks, themselves, are
endowed with normal thoughts. Looking at those who are pinheads,
limbless, dwarves, a bearded lady and her baby bearded girl, twins
physically attached to each other by the hip, and the assorted other
real freaks used in this film, has its initial shock to those not used
to seeing the abnormal, but that should soon wear off and what remains
is how sympathetic the audience becomes to the freaks, who are part of a
travelling circus sideshow. They seem so childlike in nature and
close-knit, as they bond together for protection from a hostile outside
world. This apology was not needed.</P>
<P>MGM  has foolishly edited out 30-minutes of the film, thus reducing this
B&W horror film to around 63-minutes. The price paid, is that character
development for some of the subplots fails to materialize with any
conviction felt.</P>
<P>This movie was banned in Great Britain until 1963. Which is a revolting
statement about where that country's sense of freedom of speech is at,
more than it was a reflection of how gross the picture was.</P>
<P>Browning, who had a background in the circus and made two previous films
about circus life, The Unknown and The Show, was tarnished by the studio
system after he made this film, a film that lost money for Irving
Thalberg's studio and one the executives despised having their name
attached to.</P>
<P>It is film that will build to a climax, escalating in violence and
tension, turning to a nightmare, where revenge for the obscene villains,
who happen to be the ones who are normal, but are tormenting a midget,
progresses to a point where it only seems right that the freaks gang up
on them and give the heavies the due they deserve.</P>
<P>The story revolves around two midgets who are engaged and are part of
the travelling circus, the sideshow ringmasters, Hans (Harry Earles) and
Frieda (Daisy Earles), who in real life are siblings. He lusts after a
full-grown woman, a trapeze artist in the circus who looks like Mae
West, Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova). She finds it amusing to be with him
and relishes her role in breaking up his engagement with Frieda, as she
gets him to keep giving her expensive gifts and laughs callously at him
behind his back, with her boyfriend, the brutish strongman in the
circus, Hercules (Henry Victor). When Frieda confronts her to stop
making a fool of Hans, she mistakingly reveals to Cleo that Hans has
inherited a fortune. This prompts the cold-hearted Cleo to get Hans to
marry her.</P>
<P>The wedding celebration turns into a macabre scene, that is both vexing
and titillating to a certain degree. Cleopatra passionately kisses her
obnoxious strongman in front of the groom. The normal friends of the
strongman are laughing derisively at the spiritually crushed Hans, as a
limbless freak starts to insanely chant "gooble-gobble" while perched on
the banquet table. The freaks then all chant repeatedly in unison, "One
of us; we accept her;" but Cleopatra turns colors, the joke is over, as
she defiantly says I am no freak and calls them freaks.</P>
<P>Back in Cleo's carnival wagon, she poisons Hans' drink, but Venus
confronts her former sadist lover, Hercules, and threatens him unless he
tells the doctor treating Hans about the poison. With the medicine the
doctor gives, Cleo attempts to poison Hans again as she gives him his
dosage, but this time she is surrounded by all the freaks who band
together and attack her, as she somehow gets mutilated offscreen. She is
last heard clucking like a chicken.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, in the heavy rain, Hercules goes after Venus (Leila Hyams), a
seal trainer, who is pulling her carnival wagon out to escape from his
fury when Phroso the clown (Wallace Ford) comes to her rescue, and when
he can't handle Hercules by himself, the freaks stick the heavy with a
knife and that's the last we see of that dude. Reportedly, the part of
him being castrated was cut from the film.</P>
<P>The final scene, which has the look of being tacked on, was indeed
tacked on, as the studio insisted on a happy ending. Hans has gone into
retreat, living like a millionaire in an elegant house, but is unhappy,
when Phroso and Venus bring along Daisy and the two lovebirds reconcile.</P>
<P>I would have to think because of the way the film was cut, the
characters of Phroso and his lady friend Venus, were never developed and
remain dry portrayals. Their roles were just not that interesting.</P>
<P>The final revenge of the freaks, is that they made Cleopatra a part of
the sideshow, she is featured as the "Feathered Hen," a limbless figure
with feathers, unable to talk, who puts a fright into the visitors
viewing her in a cage. She is introduced by a carnival barker who
manufactures some story to go with her condition about a royal prince
shooting himself for her love. That is how the film opened and closed.</P>
<P>The director did make three other films (Mark of the Vampire (1935)/The
Devil Doll (1936)/Miracles for Sale (39)) after this one that were
moderately successful, and then retired to live a very rich life.</P>
<P>The obvious themes of the film are that there is strength in numbers,
that the beauty of an individual should be judged by their inner
character and not by their outward appearance, that we are all human
beings and that to mock someone else is like mocking ourselves, and that
one shouldn't prejudge individuals in a biased way. If those aims are
controversial, then it is no wonder there is still so much irrational
hatred in the world. And by the way, Browning did not exploit the
freaks, as the critics in the 1930s said, he made the normal people who
were intolerant to be the grotesque ones.</P>
