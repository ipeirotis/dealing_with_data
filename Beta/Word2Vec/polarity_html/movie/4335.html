<P>     Around the time that Mike Figgis began production of LEAVING LAS
VEGAS, John O'Brien, the author of the book upon which the film is
based, shot himself in the head.  This story, according to O'Brien's
father, is his son's suicide note.  And what an epitaph it is...</P>
<P>     By their nature, most love stories are relentlessly optimistic.  An
upbeat tone and a happy ending are almost mandatory.  So it's unusual
for a romance to delve as deeply into the dark realms of the human
psyche as LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  This motion picture is an examination of
both the power and the impotence of love.  That emotion is not, as some
would have us believe, a magical cure to wipe away life's troubles and
tribulations.  Neither is it an unqualified gateway to salvation.</P>
<P>     LEAVING LAS VEGAS tells the story of Ben (Nicolas Cage), an
unapologetic drunk, and Sera (Elisabeth Shue), a prostitute.  After Ben
loses his LA job, he takes his termination pay and heads to Vegas, that
American mecca of glitz and greed where souls go to die.  His intent is
not to gamble, however, but to do something more certain:  take a room
in a flea-bag motel, buy as much booze as he can afford, and drink
himself to death.  By his estimation, that should take only a few weeks.
But Ben is a lonely man and, even as his body craves alcohol, his heart
yearns for companionship.  So, when he sees Sera walking the streets, he
offers her $500 for an hour.  As it turns out, though, what he needs
more than sex is a friendly ear.  Thus begins the relationship that
forms the film's core.</P>
<P>     One of the reasons LEAVING LAS VEGAS is so heartbreakingly haunting
is that the unconditional love between Ben and Sera blossoms against a
backdrop of desperation, loneliness, and self-destruction.  Ben's only
plea to Sera is that she never try to stop him from drinking.  This is
not a lesson movie like WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN, where the triumph over
alcoholism forms the central dynamic.  Instead, LEAVING LAS VEGAS is
about passion that flares brightly for a moment before being
extinguished.  The audience understands when Sera says, "We both
realized that we didn't have that much time.  I accepted him as he was
and didn't expect him to change.  He needed me.  I loved him--I really
loved him."</P>
<P>     LEAVING LAS VEGAS wouldn't be as difficult to sit through--equal
parts transcendent beauty and unbearable pain--if it weren't for a
pair of magnificent performances.  Since this is essentially a two-
character story, nearly every scene is built around Ben, Sera, or (more
frequently) both.  Actor Nicolas Cage, who has a track record of
immersing himself in parts, gives one of the year's most powerful acting
turns.  In this movie, the charisma and outward energy form a fragile
shell over a pit of despair and self-loathing.  Yet at the same time,
there's a sense of freedom--for Ben, death has lost its power to
frighten.  Cage melds all those elements into this complex, multi-
layered portrayal.  Meanwhile, Elisabeth Shue, whose filmography is far
less impressive, matches Cage scene-for-scene, emotion-for-emotion.
There's no glamour in this role, but we still see the beauty that
attracts Ben--tarnished and dulled, perhaps, but still obviously
there.</P>
<P>     Rarely does a motion picture create such conflicting emotions in
the viewer.  Like the French film SAVAGE NIGHTS (about living with
AIDS), but far better crafted, LEAVING LAS VEGAS has no taboos.  It
doesn't moralize about its characters.  Mike Figgis (INTERNAL AFFAIRS)
has filmed an amazing dual character study.  Like great poetry where
each verse strives for new highs and lows, LEAVING LAS VEGAS draws its
audience along a rarely-traveled path whose scope can only be fully
appreciated in the silence of the aftermath.</P>
