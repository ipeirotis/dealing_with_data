<PRE>                              THE STAR MAKER
                          (L' UOMO DELLE STELLE)
                       A film review by Edwin Jahiel
                        Copyright 1996 Edwin Jahiel</PRE>
<P>THE STAR MAKER (L'UOMO NELLE STELLE)(Italy,1995)  *** 1/2  Directed by 
Giuseppe Tornatore. Written by Tornatore and Fabio Rinaudo. Photography, 
Dante Spinotti. Editing, Massimo Quaglia.Production design, Francesco 
Bronzi. Music, Ennio Morricone.  Cast: Sergio Castellitto (Joe Morelli), 
Tiziana Lodato (Beata), many professionals and non-professionals. A 
Miramax release. In Italian with subtitles. 113 minutes. Rated R (sex)</P>
<P>Behind his battered but professional  movie camera, Joe Morelli 
instructs his subjects: "Right profile. Left profile. Center profile." 
Center profile indeed! It makes as much sense as the streams of rural 
Sicilians who pose for what has been sold to them as a "screen test." </P>
<P>You know right away that they are all the victims of a fraud.  In 
postwar Sicily,  scam artist Joe covers villages and small towns. The 
phony talent scout arrives in a truck covered with Hollywood posters, 
its loudpseaker blaring come-ons. He sets up his equipment in a large 
tent, dazzles people with name-dropping ("great actors I have 
discovered") and especially with the astronomical earning of stars. He 
then offers to shoot screen tests that will be examined by a big film 
studio in Rome. " I promise nothing" says "Doctor" Morelli, but that 
won't kill any dreams.  </P>
<P>He adds that a small service fee will be charged - 1,500 lire, which was 
about a dollar, not a trivial sum for impoverished Sicily around 1950.   </P>
<P>Naivete, ignorance, hopelessness propel the locals into Joe's tent, but 
there are as many diverse reasons as there are faces among the 
wannabees. And voices. Joe records them on what must have been the last 
of the wire-recorders. (Its high fidelity is astounding). He has them 
learn a sentence or two from "Gone With the Wind," which adds to the 
ludicrousness and comedy of the situation, one made even more enjoyable 
for those who know Italian and are aware of Sicilian speech. (When Joe 
thinks that the local cop is on to him, he is relieved to find out that 
the man just wants his own test, to recite The Divine Comedy" which he 
had translated into Sicilian). </P>
<P>Sicilan-born Giuseppe Tornatore's second big screen feature (he came 
from photography and then TV), was the splendid, Oscar-winning "Cinema 
Paradiso." It was a hard act to follow, but the next movie, the entirely 
different "Everybody's Fine," was a very good picaresque road film about 
a Sicilian widower. Tornatore then did an excellent episode in an 
omnibus film. Then, the 1994 "A Pure Formality" broke with the 
writer-director's Sicilianness, was an ambitious, semi-Kafkaesque 
failure. With "The Star Maker" Tornatore follows the hard act of "Cinema 
Paradiso" with  confidence and ease.  Not with a sequel but by working 
the downside of the movies'magic.  </P>
<P>The film's early section is one of light irony and mockery. Yet in a 
tour-de-force that is not at all obvious, Tornatore's sensitive script 
and Castellitto's layered acting never allow condescension toward the 
subjects. Joe may be fleecing his customers, Joe sometimes mutters " 
Animals, dumb beasts, rednecks!" but at the same time he has soft spots 
and a  comprehension of the underprivileged. There's a duality here. Joe 
shoots his footage on outdated film, yet on the job he seems to have an 
odd sort of professional conscience.</P>
<P>Gradually, the film gets more serious as it goes from the amusing to the 
satirical to the pathetic. Joe is perceived as influential in the film 
trade. A penniless mother offers him her body, hoping to promote her 
daughter.  A man in a Mussolini hat, delivers a Duce-style harangue.  An 
aged veteran who never spoke after his return from  the Spanish Civil 
War,   suddenly finds his speech before the camera, and, in Spanish, 
speaks insultingly of Franco, lyrically of his "Fifth Regiment." </P>
<P>He is touching. Pathetic too is the gay hairdresser who states that all 
others, including bandits and women (sic) now have rights, but not the 
gays. Eventually though, this moment with Joe, this confession to the 
camera, result in courage and optimism, change the man's life for the 
better. Later too, Joe is reproached for hearing more confessions than 
any priest. But, like a priest,  he does nor intrude on privacy -- and 
some confessions may have a salutary effect. </P>
<P>The encounters are not mechanically plotted. Tornatore can go from a sad 
moment to an outlandish scene, as when, in an episode worthy of The Book 
of Chutzpahs,  bandits who rob Joe end up by paying him for screen 
tests. Or as when Joe must take pictures of a never-photographed, now 
dead, Mafia Don. The sendup of Mafiosi is a gem. </P>
<P>Pathos arrives again on the scene in the shapely form of Beata,  
convent-born and bred, age 15 or 18 (she doesn't know),a cleaning woman 
for many, including an older man who gives her the 1,500 lire for a 
screen test, in exchange of Beata giving him a look at her naked body. 
Joe, moved by her simplicity, shoots additional footage of her, as 
though -- in another key to the movie -- he himself took his scam for a 
reality. In intriguing ways, Beata now becomes, off and on,  part of 
Joe's life.</P>
<P>More travels through Sicily show the land's uniqueness and beauty, never 
postcardish,   never artsy,  but as glimpses on what is part of the 
action. </P>
<P>Joe's manipulation of his customers is a scaled down version of politics 
and exploitation.
He gives a ride to an educated doctor who tells him of a  whore who 
cheats villagers, as all others do, from the government to the local 
authorities. "We don't want those who sell dreams, like you, to take 
advantage of us." There's always a bigger fish that swallows the next 
size down. Soon, Joe himself uis victimized.  </P>
<P>"The Star Maker," has superior photography  (especially in the tricky 
tent shots) and one of those scores in Italian movies that cleverly use 
American pop songs, "Stardust" in this case. Subtler, much less 
sentimental, nostalgic or audience-manipulating than "Cinema Paradiso," 
the new film will, for those reasons, not attain the earlier movie's 
popularity. A pity, since it speaks volumes on a specific society and 
its culture. </P>
<P>In a sense Joe's travels are like Gulliver's (but among the gullible) 
and even closer to the classic 1941 film "Sullivan's Travels"  which  
concluded  that the more miserable people are, the more they need to 
escape into fantasy. Like Joe's clients who have stars in their eyes and 
get their little moments of dreaming movie dreams. </P>
