<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Douglas Fairbanks plays his first action hero role as Zorro, the sort of
part he will play for the rest of his film career, before this very
popular film he was cast only in light comedies. He also produced the
film, as he formed a studio called United Artists, that also included
partners Mary Pickford, D.W. Griffith, and Charlie Chaplin.</P>
<P>This fun-type of swashbuckler, gave him a chance to show-off his
athletic ability, as he himself did all the dueling scenes and acrobatic
routines the story required. He is dressed in a black mask-and- cape,
which gave the role a certain amount of appeal to audiences.</P>
<P>The film is not much on character study, instead it's filled with action
sequences and a melodramatic love story between Zorro, who hides his
true identity of being the son of the aristocratic rancher Don Alejandro
(De Gray), and the sweet Lolita Pukido (Marguerite).</P>
<P>He is forced by his father to seek a wife, Lolita, and appears to be
very unmanly to her, forcing her to reject him even though he is so
wealthy and her father wants this marriage. She is the daughter of a
blue-blooded Spanish family that has fallen on hard times, her father is
Don Carlos Pulido (Charles Hill Mailes) and her mother is Dona Catalina
Pulido (Claire McDowell).</P>
<P>The reason for the Zorro disguise, is because he just returned three
months ago from studying in Spain and wants to secretly organize the
caballeros against the oppressors who are, especially, cruel towards the
poor, the natives and the priests. He leaves his trade-mark of a Z on
the skin of those oppressors he duels with.</P>
<P>The action takes place in 19th century Southern California, where the
corrupt governor, Alvarado (Periolat), who is from the northern part,
where he controls the colonial territory, comes south because he is
upset with Zorro's interference in his affairs. He will post a reward to
get him dead or alive. There is no mistake about who the goodguys and
who the badguys are in this childlike adventure story. The heavies are
played like heavies were played in the old days of filmmaking: and are
the governor and his henchmen- Sergeant Pedro Gonzalez (Noah Berry) and
Captain Ramos (Robert McKim).</P>
<P>A typical action scene, is the one in the cantina, where Zorro suddenly
appears and fights a duel with Sergeant Ramos while keeping all the
other soldiers at bay. It reminded me of a Charlie Chaplin routine, the
one where he's the tramp and is kicking the cop in his behind. Zorro
likes to laugh a lot and play cat-and-mouse games with his enemies,
all-the-while courting danger, as he disarms his opponent and toys with
him.</P>
<P>The film disappointed me in many ways, not the least being, that his
plan to help the poor, seemed misplaced, and that this was more a story
of aristocrats and those of wealth versus bad politicians rather than
the Robin Hood story it projected itself to be. It was really a stretch
to believe that the noble Zorro was anything but a rich aristocrat
having a bit of sport, and finding love with someone he could have
easily found love with anyway without going through his masquerade. The
story itself was a cliche, featuring his cardboard-typed father wanting
his son not to be an idler and make something of himself, while the son
feigns being fatigued all the time and acting effeminate, performing
silly magic tricks when he should be seriously courting the eligible
senorita his father fixed him up with. There is also the faithful native
servant, Roberto (Tote Du Crow), who knows Don Diego Vega's secrets, but
cannot speak, he can only hear. It was the type of part you can almost
expect to see in a film like this, and one that is void of any real
human emotions.</P>
<P>There are no surprises in this predictable costume actioner, but it is
pleasantly shot in B&W with a tinted look to it. It should please those
who like their films to be lighthearted. Because it was such a
successful film box-office wise and was a precursor to the type of film
Hollywood is noted for putting forth, it could be interesting just to
see how this silent yarn compares with the viewer's take on the more
modern action films.</P>
