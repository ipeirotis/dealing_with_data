<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Griffin Dunne, actor-turned-director, directs this mockdocumentary, with him
becoming part of the action in a purposefully obtrusive way. "Famous" was
created by two unemployed actors who also star in it, Nat DeWolf (Tate Kelley)
and Laura Kirk (Lisa Picard), which as it turns out is a fictional story about
two unemployed actors who seek fame and fortune. It's a theme that's been done
often, but in this very witty and bitter-sweet comedy the characters are truly
endearing and funny. </P>
<P>The project got off the ground four years ago when Nat and Laura were living in
NYC and were co-scripting a movie. Mira Sorvino was in the same acting class as
Laura and read the script. She laughed so much, that she decided to co-produce
the project with Dolly Hall, a lifelong friend of Griffin Dunne. That's how
Griffin got aboard and took control, as he was able to get funding and lineup a
host of celebs doing cameos. The actors improvised a script by doing readings in
their apartment and when it came time for filming, they had a tight script which
they adhered to about eighty percent of the time. There was one scene they did
by an elevator, where a guy who had a bit part in a minor film just became part
of the film unexpectedly as he was interviewed by Dunne. The film was shot on a
digital camera. </P>
<P>Lisa Picard is the focus of a documentary. She's the potentially famous actor
whom the filmmaker, played by Dunne, is searching the streets of Manhattan for:
"An actress who would talk to me before she got famous," and he believes it's
imminent that the one who is so willing to talk to him, Lisa, will become
famous. She's already on her way in the business, as the soft porn commercial
she did advertising a 'Wheat Chex' cereal got her some notoriety. She also by
chance got a bit part in Melissa Gilbert's upcoming made-for-TV movie "Phone
Call For Help." Her gay best friend is also a struggling actor, Tate Kelley. His
claim to fame is as an extra on a soap opera, and he is diligently pushing a
one-man off-off Broadway play about his anger at the public's homophobia and to
celebrate his own gay pride. He performs in his underwear and gives a shrill
performance that is bound to turn everyone off; the filmmaker manages to get in
a dig at newspaper theater critics and their supposed good taste, by having one
of them give it a rave review. This gets the attention of celebs Spike Lee and
Charlie Sheen, who bring it to Hollywood and change the story and almost leave
the dull Tate completely out of the film--as they just credit him with the film
being based on his play. </P>
<P>What makes the two leads hilarious, is that they are ambitious to the point of
being narrow-minded and are humorless about their situation. They can't stop
from being self-centered. Lisa has a few very funny scenes with her pliable
boyfriend (London), who supports the self-absorbed actress through thick and
thin and when he is no longer useful to her gets pushed aside by the pushy but
not-famous-yet actress. She was also very funny auditioning for an Advil spot
which she doesn't get, as behind the humor it shows how being rejected is part
of the business but it is very difficult not to take it as something personal.</P>
<P>The film does a savage job dissecting the thirst there is for fame, in a
storyline that is very much New Yorkish in attitude and spirit. Buck Henry has
some funny comments as a talking head on how fame makes you feel good, while
noted underground filmmaker, someone who is not famous, David Holtzman, comments
he has known famous people tell him their fame is like eating all the time. It
might not be all new material and the characters do grow somewhat weary after a
fast start but, all things considered, it was surprisingly a lot of fun. </P>
<P>When at the Williamstown Film Festival, where I saw it, Nat was asked his take
on fame and replied: "I bought a tux for the Cannes Film Festival and ended up
wearing the tux the remainder of the year to do catering work." The two are
presently working on two other comedy scripts, but as of yet fame has not come
their way. The two are still unemployed and are contemplating any offers for a
TV series. But they are concerned on how the characters they created would
change if a TV series picked it up, as they don't want to sell out or get
fame--but they do want employment in their chosen field. </P>
