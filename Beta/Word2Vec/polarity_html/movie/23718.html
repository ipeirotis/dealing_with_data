<P>Hong Kong cinema has been going through a bad spell. The last few
productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both
the best and worst of American filmmaking with the same qualities of
Hong Kong films. In a nutshell, the current crop of films from Hong
Kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous.
With the one time British colony reverting back to Mainland ownership,
a lot of Hong Kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on
U.S. productions. Such talents as Jackie Chan (Rush Hour), Chow
Yun-Fat (Anna & the King, The Corrupter) and Yuen Woo-Ping (The
Matrix) have all moved into the budget bloated world of Hollywood
filmmaking with mixed results. Now we can add two other Hong Kong
filmmakers to the mix with star Jet Li and Director and Fight
choreographer Corey Yuen Kwai. Unfortunately "Romeo Must Die" bears
all the trademarks of a typical Hollywood action film and none of Hong
Kong's rhythms.</P>
<P>The film opens in a nightclub as an Asian Couple is necking. Enter a
group of Chinese gangsters led by Kai Sing (Russell Wong). Kai
confronts Po Sing (Jon Kit Lee), the son of Kai's boss and leader of
the local Chinese family. A battle breaks out between the bodyguards
of the club and Kai, who handily kicks and punches his opponents down.
It's not until club owner Silk (rapper DMX), bears down on Kai and his
henchmen that the fight ends.</P>
<P>The following morning Po Sing is found dead. Suspicions escalate, as
Issac O'Day (Delroy Lindo) is told of the murder. His concern that the
war between his and the Chinese family may explode and ruin his plans
to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate
venture. Issac implores his chief of security, Mac (Issiah Washington)
to watch after his son and daughter.</P>
<P>The scene shifts to a prison in China, where Han Sing (Jet Li) learns
of his brothers murder. He fights with the guards and is dragged off
to be disciplined. Hung upside down by one foot, Han recovers and
battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight
choreography and stunt work. Escaping to the U.S. Han sets out to find
the person responsible for his brother's death.</P>
<P>"Romeo Must Die" is in many ways a fun film. It is both absurd and
assured. The basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate
echoes "The Godfather". The relationship between Jet Li's Han and
Aaliyah's Trish O'Day reminds us of Abel Ferrera's "China Girl",
except that Romeo Must Die's couple never once exchange more than a
loving glance towards one another. Their romance is much more
puritanical than any other romance in film history.
The performances are adequate if not fully acceptable. Li, of course
has the showiest part, having to express both an innocents and
steadfast determination. Allayah, in her feature film debut manages to
carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace. It's
obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic. But,
still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor
performance would not have affected it. Delro Lindo as Issac O'day
carries himself well in the film. An unsung and under appreciated
actor, Mr. Lindo turns out the films best performance. The other
performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for
D. B. Woodside as Issac's son, Colin. The performance is undirected,
with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with
whatever location he is in. An unfocused performance that should have
been reigned in and / or better written.</P>
<P>First time director Andrzej Bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in
handling the film. Having a career as one of the industry's best
cinematographers, Bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots, and "Romeo
Must Die" does look good. But the pacing of the film is lethargic,
only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes. The script
by Eric Bernt and John Jarrell is not focused in such a way that we
can care about the characters or the situations they are in. The big
gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of
a sports center for a NFL team is needlessly confusing. And of course
the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the
film becomes painfully obvious here as Anthony Anderson as Allayah's
bodyguard, Maurice has no comic timing whatsoever.</P>
<P>The best things about the film are its fight scenes. Jet Li is a
master of these intricate physical battles. One needs only to see his
film "Fist of Legend" to understand that the man is without peer in
the realm of Martial Art combat. Here, Jet is given the opportunity to
show off in a way that "Lethal Weapon 4" (Jet's U.S. debut) didn't
allow. Unfortunately, a lot of Jet's fights are aided with computer
effects that detract from his ability and precision. Also "Romeo Must
Die" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever
committed to film, and that is an x-ray effect that appears three
times during the course of the film, showing the effect of bone
crushing blows on an opponent. Obviously a homage to the famed x-ray
scene from Sonny Chiba's "Streetfighter", the scenes here are just
pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film. It's as if the
film has stopped and a video game has been inserted.</P>
<P>One problem though about the fight scenes. Those that are familiar
with Hong Kong action know that even though the films are fantasies
and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon. They do have
an internal rhythm to them. A heartbeat, so to speak in their
choreography. The fight scenes in a Hong Kong film breath with an
emotional resonance. This is created by the performance, the direction
and the editing. Here in "Romeo Must Die", there is no staccato. Every
fight scene, even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring
as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a
set pattern. The rhythm is monotonous. A Hong Kong film has a tempo
that changes, heightening its emotional impact. 'RMD' is limited to a
standard 4/4 tempo, not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever.</P>
<P>A fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple
of Jackie Chan's films.. watch the restaurant fight from the film
"Rush Hour" and notice that the context of the fight, while
technically amazing is rather flat (the framing and cut always do not
help). Now look at the warehouse fight from "Rumble in the Bronx".
There you have a heartbeat, and emotional draw that doesn't let the
audience catch its breath. The stops and pauses for dramatic effect
work perfectly, causing the viewer to be both astounded and
flabbergasted. Here in 'Romeo Must Die', the fight scenes have no more
emotional content or character than any John Wayne barroom brawl.</P>
<P>Jet Li is a grand and personable screen presence. it's a shame that
his full talents were not used to full effect here. One day filmmakers
here in the U.S. will stop making films by the numbers and start to
embrace the style and emotion that has made Hong Kong action pictures
such a commodity. Until then, we'll be left with emotionally hollow
product like "The Replacement Killer" and, currently "Romeo Must Die".</P>
