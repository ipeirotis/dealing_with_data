<P>     I note the following in the interest of fairness:  a smattering of
audience applause greeted the conclusion of A DOG OF FLANDERS at the
screening I attended.  That audience consisted almost entirely of parents
and pre-teens, causing me to ponder comments I've received over the years
regarding whether "family films" should be held to a different critical
standard.  Sure, A DOG OF FLANDERS could appeal to children without very
discriminating tastes; yes, parents may be happy to find something warm
'n' fuzzy for the young'uns.  I, however, watched as someone who expects
little things like decent performances, a narrative with a point, and a
script that doesn't feel like it was written _by_ children instead of
_for_ children.  A DOG OF FLANDERS is simple, non-threatening, harmless
family filmmaking that also happens to be thoroughly uninteresting on
almost any level.</P>
<P>     Based on a 19th century children's tale by Ouida, A DOG OF FLANDERS
tells the story of a young boy named Nello Daas (Jesse James) living in
Belgium -- presumably the late 1800's, presumably around Antwerp.  A poor
farmboy living with his ailing grandfather (Jack Warden), Nello dreams of
being a great painter some day like his idol Peter Paul Rubens.  Despite
the support of kindly local artist Michel La Grande (Jon Voight), however,
Nello seems trapped by his social station.  Class conflict grows more
evident when the teenage Nello (Jeremy James Richter) encounters objection
to his friendship with a merchant's daughter (Farren Monet), and even
finds himself accused of arson.  But Nello always perseveres, entering a
youth art contest and maintaining a pure and honest heart.</P>
<P>     If you notice the conspicuous lack of any dog mentioned in that plot
summary, there's a very good reason.  Despite the title, Nello's pet
Bouvier des Flanders, Patrasche, plays only a token role in the film's
events.  That's not just unfortunate because it's somewhat deceptive --
it's unfortunate because the dog may turn in the film's best performance.
The young performers, particularly newcomer Farren Monet, at least have
inexperience as an excuse.  Voight and Warden, who fuss and knit their
brows and play with ever-varying accents, earn no such slack.  A DOG OF
FLANDERS may be a youth melodrama, but there's not a moment of real
character-based emotion to make the film tolerable as a narrative.  It's
hard to imagine how a production like this avoided the direct-to-video
dustbin.</P>
<P>     It's also hard to imagine from this version that the story is such a
classic that it has already been filmed three previous times.  Without a
familiarity with either the source material or the earlier film
incarnations, I can only assume that a story with such appeal had to focus
on the adventures of a boy and his faithful dog.  This film focuses on the
adventures of a boy as he discovers the pitfalls of his poverty, takes
milk into town, draws pictures of his childhood sweetheart, discusses art
theory with his mentor La Grande, and learns hard lessons about the
politics of youth art contests.  There is a colorful encounter with a
traveling circus, it's true, and one moderately rousing chase and knife
fight with Patrasche's cruel former owner.  Otherwise, A DOG OF FLANDERS
delivers the kind of timeless youth appeal one usually associates with an
evening of CNN.</P>
<P>     I suppose it's pointless to add the cartoonish villainy of Nello's
landlord (who also yells at his wife and calls her "woman," so we know
he's a really bad guy), or to note the retina-rattling eye-rolling that
accompanied a Yoda-like apparition of Rubens himself, or to snicker at the
WIZARD OF OZ denouement which includes a not-at-all startling revelation
of parentage.  Those who enjoy the film will probably find ways in which
those elements complement the story perfectly.  For me, A DOG OF FLANDERS
lacked any of the elements which bring life to a family film -- emotional
resonance, strong relationships, well-drawn characters.  I'm not going to
deny the appeal of a protagonist who perseveres and maintains a pure and
honest heart, especially for parents looking to teach strength of
character.  It would have been nice, however, to build a watchable film
around that strength of character.  I'll leave this one to those parents
and children who watch with a heroic generosity of spirit, those who won't
leave thinking the real dog is the film itself.</P>
