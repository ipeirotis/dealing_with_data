<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>French director Agnès Varda's "Kung Fu Master" tells the intriguing
story of an illicit romance between a 14-year-old and a middle-aged
divorcee. It is adapted from an idea by English actress and singer Jane
Birkin, who plays the older woman, and it is sensitively directed by the
real-life mother of the boy.</P>
<P>The film takes us into territory film's rarely traverse. It crosses the
emotional boundaries of a forbidden love. What starts out as a longing
desire develops into a strong desire for love on the part of the older
woman, as the slender Mary-Jane (Birkin) becomes attracted to the
pathetic look the smallish Julien (Demy) has after she helps him vomit
when he gets drunk. He is attending a birthday party for her daughter
Lucy (Gainsbourg), who is his classmate. The relationship picks up steam
when he makes a bold sexual move on her and she feels flattered by it,
as it stirs up something indescribable within her.</P>
<P>They meet again when she feels compelled to search him out in school and
they go with her young daughter Lou to a nearby cafe, where Julien is
content to play a difficult video game he is obsessed with, Kung Fu
Master. He is adept at moving around an animated karate master who must
save a damsel in distress. The meditative approach he has to the game is
the same one he applies to catching the older woman, as they both suffer
from the aches of loneliness. He is an outsider in his group because he
wears braces and is small, while she can't connect with anyone since her
divorce. Timing, which is a key to all romances blooming, is just right
here.</P>
<P>The film leaves the world of reality and plays more like fantasy, when
Mary-Jane takes Julien along with her on a holiday to meet her parents
in London. In her parents' English garden she is spotted by Lucy kissing
Julien, and the daughter gets revolted by what she sees. To the rescue
comes Mary-Jane's mother (Campbell), who suggests she take Julien and
Lou to a deserted island to test the strength of this romance. On the
island, we see them kiss and are not made aware if anything more
intimate took place.</P>
<P>The boy's parents and the school principal learn of this affair, and she
is marked as a corrupt woman. Lucy goes to live with dad and Julien is
forced to change schools and never contact her again.</P>
<P>The film asks the question about what makes us love someone. When Lucy
is asked what kind of boy attracts her, she has a list of things that
include the boy has to be tall and not wear a leather jacket, he must be
easygoing, not a gossip, and not be stupid. Mom's ideal is hardly less
childish which is the point Varda is making, the ideal mate sought is
all about one's feelings and they are irrational.</P>
<P>This is a suggestive film, touching a tabu subject, but it handles it
delicately with an unflinching directness. This affair is viewed with
the same frankness Varda thinks we should view all things in life. For
her, condoms are a fact of life and should be made available to all who
need them. The current AIDS epidemic must be faced with humor and real
knowledge, or else ignorance about it will cause more damage than good.
Perhaps lovers have to look also at what is real and what is fantasy,
and face themselves and what it is they desire and not worry about what
society thinks. This film did not exploit an exploitive situation, and
it provided much fuel for thought.</P>
