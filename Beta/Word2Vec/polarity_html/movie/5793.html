<P>"Unlike earthquakes, their fury is precise. Unlike hurricanes, their
reach is unlimited. Unlike fires, there is no way to combat them.
Unlike floods, their terror is sudden." - excerpt from TWISTER
production notes</P>
<P>I'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen
tornadoes (or twisters) before. I for one, have only seen the
devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on TV
and personally, I feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near
the destruction caused by hurricanes and
earthquakes........that is until I saw TWISTER. The destruction caused
by twisters may be precise (not widespread but it moves very fast and
its path of destruction is unpredictable. It will suck in cars,
houses, livestock, etc..... basically anything in its path that is not
firmly rooted to the ground and in TWISTER, you'll get to see all this
- close up!</P>
<P>TWISTER tells a tale about a group of Storm Chasers. These people are
basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on
twister-occurrences, they risk their lives by literally chasing
tornadoes, trying to get as close as they can.....that is if the
tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them! Jo
(Helen Hunt) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes. While they are
gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite
recon, Bill (Bill Paxton), a former co- leader of the team returns to
settle some divorce papers with Jo. Apparently, Bill has left his
rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a
television weatherman. He catches up with his old-self and follows the
pack like the good ole days, bringing his wife-to-be Melissa (Jamie
Gertz) along, a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone. Jo has
finally implemented Bills initial idea of a device called Dorothy
which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on
how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system
can be implemented. The problem is, the device has to be placed very
near the twister, and in its path (which is practically unpredictable)
of destruction in order for it to function. To add to their current
challenge, there is another group of Storm Chasers that is
corporation-funded led by Jonas (Cary Elwes) and they too have a
similar device. Thus begins the race; Jo's cheap government equipment
with beaten-up vehicles against Jonas's high-tech computers and
satellite link-ups with their sleek, black all-terrain vans.</P>
<P>Plot wise, there are not really anything to shout about. TWISTER is as
predictable as any summer box-office hit can get. There is the danger
of the twister, the competition with Jonas^Os more well-off team and
of course, the settling of differences between Jo and Bill (this part
gives the film its human substance). Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton and the
rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of
them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister
itself! Thanks to the impressive digital effects by ILM (Lucasfilm's
Industrial Light and Magic), we get to see the terror and destruction
caused by tornadoes up close; from stripping barns and houses to
lifting up livestock!</P>
<P>Jan de Bont once again proves his visual abiility (thanks to
his years of experience as a director of photography for action films)
for action sequences. Like his previous film SPEED, the tornado
sequences (which are essentially THE action sequences) are well
visualised and edited. Audiences will be holding tight to their chairs
everytime a tornado comes on screen! The surround sound effects sure
does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister! (The cinema must
at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this)
TWISTER is definitely an effect-dependent movie.</P>
<P>Now that ID4 fever has begun to reside, and people are getting bored
of watching Will Smith whoop ET's ass for the umpteenth
time......TWISTER is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent! Watch it in
a good theatre...please.</P>
<P>THE FLYING INKPOT's rating system:
* Wait for the video.
** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!
*** Pretty good, bring a friend.
**** Amazing, potent stuff.
***** Perfection. See it twice.</P>
