<P>     All through its production and into the early days of its initial, 
aborted pre-release publicity, HARD RAIN bore the appropriate moniker of 
THE FLOOD.  Ultimately, however, Paramount Pictures, nervous that this 
movie would be confused with 1996's other, underperforming disaster 
films (DANTE'S PEAK, VOLCANO), changed the title and shifted the release 
date by nearly a year.  But, to paraphrase the Bard, swill, by any other 
name, would smell as rank.  No number of name changes can help this 
picture.  It's not just about a disaster, it is a disaster.</P>
<P>     HARD RAIN is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with 
every passing minute.  The best shot occurs during the opening credits, 
as the camera pans over the streets and byways of Huntingburg, Indiana 
as the water level slowly rises.  The community, protected by an 
overworked dam, is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour 
relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies.  From that moment on, it's all 
downhill.  Whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has 
long since drained away by the halfway point.  It takes forever to get 
to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute 
motion pictures I have recently endured.</P>
<P>     Basically, HARD RAIN is one extended, dull chase sequence 
punctuated by occasional shoot-outs.  There's a lot of water, broken 
glass, gunfire, and explosions.  It's all very routine and uninteresting 
because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally 
makes sense.  The film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost 
worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the 
monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the 
myriad subplots that are floating around.  </P>
<P>     Action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating 
as they rush towards a conclusion.  Graham Yost, the writer of both 
SPEED and HARD RAIN, surely understands that principle.  Unfortunately, 
neither he, nor cinematographer-turned-director Mikael Salomon (A FAR 
OFF PLACE), applies it.  The action in HARD RAIN grows tedious through 
repetition.  We see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases, flood 
damage, shoot-outs, etc. -- over and over again.  The movie constantly 
recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time 
out to an acceptable movie length.</P>
<P>     The storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in 
contrived circumstances.  There's Tom (Christian Slater), the one-
dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored 
car full of cash.  He and his partner, Charlie (Edward Asner, TV's "Lou 
Grant"), get stuck on a street that's rapidly turning into a river.  A 
group of men, led by Jimmy (Morgan Freeman), arrive on the scene not as 
rescuers but as robbers.  After Charlie is killed in a shoot-out, Tom 
hides the money, then runs.  As he swims and boats his way through 
Huntingburg's roads, he encounters some of the locals:  Karen (Minnie 
Driver), a would-be love interest; a bickering old couple (Richard 
Dysart and Betty White), who are on hand to provide comic relief; and 
the easily-corrupted Sheriff (Randy Quaid), whose seeming helpfulness 
hides sinister ulterior motives.  </P>
<P>     There isn't any real acting in this film.  Christian Slater utters 
a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera.  Tom is 
easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the 
screen.  Randy Quaid sneers a lot, and is totally unconvincing.  Morgan 
Freeman and Minnie Driver both attempt to give legitimate performances, 
but they are defeated by the script.  Freeman, one of the best cinematic 
thespians working today, looks suitably embarrassed to be here, but I 
suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time.</P>
<P>     Following in the wake of TWISTER, this is yet another natural 
disaster movie that doesn't trust nature's fury as the chief engine of 
conflict.  As a result, we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad 
guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale 
could have had.  TITANIC proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a 
movie where everything goes under water.  HARD RAIN successfully 
demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible.  Thus far this year, 
Hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem 
by fire (FIRESTORM) and water (HARD RAIN).  Fortunately, there are only 
two elements left.  </P>
