<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>First-time director Cameron Crowe who was to go on and make many
successful films (Singles/Jerry Maguire), including his latest "Almost
Famous," gives his due respect to these teenage characters, whose
character are rarely treated in such films in such a plausible human
way. That alone is enough to make this a superior film, but besides
that, the film was superbly scripted and acted, with tremendous use of
the characters interacting in a real way. John Mahoney as James Court,
plays a role that is usually one-dimensional but here it has surprising
depth- as the protective and caring single-parent for his daughter Diane
(Skye), the high school valedictorian, who has received a scholarship to
study in England. John Cusack plays Lloyd Dobler, the graduating high
school student who has a crush on the brainy Diane, whose interest is
not in scholarship but kickboxing. He lives with his older sister (Joan
Cusack, his real sister) and her little boy, while their father is
stationed in the Army, serving in West Germany.</P>
<P>Lloyd calls Diane for a date, even though he doesn't travel in the same
circles as she does, though they are both children of the same
middle-class upbringing. He is attracted to her because of her eyes and
does not give up when she says no. In the habit of 'saying anything'
when nervous, fast-talking his way through situations, he gets the date,
as Diane is impressed that he made her laugh. Most boys are scared to
even ask her out, even though they find her attractive, as they are
intimidated by her brains. But Lloyd shows that he is a very confident
young man.</P>
<P>Diane worships her father, believing he is the best man in the world, as
she chooses to live with him rather than with her mother. For a
graduation present, he gives her an expensive new car, something no one
else graduating received.  He dedicates his life to giving the patients
in the nursing home he runs the best care that they can receive, which
really impresses Diane. She has a special relationship with him, where
he is not only her father but her best friend, as they have a deal where
they do not lie to each other, and she tells him everything about
herself and what she does. On her date with Lloyd, she tells him that
he's a little nutty but that she enjoyed going out to a party with him
and meeting his zany friends. She finds that she trusts him, that he is
gallant, and that he impressed her deeply when he swept aside some
broken glass on the sidewalk with his sneakers so that she could safely
walk by. She feels that he will always be there for her.</P>
<P>But the father becomes wary of Lloyd at a dinner conversation, when his
future plans seem so vague, saying he wants to become a professional
kickboxer. The father finds this career move unacceptable for someone
serious about his daughter, as he sees her as someone moving in more
elite academic company. And when she tells him that they slept together,
the father is glad that she is honest with him, but wants her to break
the summer relationship off, telling her that she will soon be in
England and it is better to have no ties  with a boy who has no solid
future. She tearfully obeys her father and resists Lloyd's attempts to
win her back, as he parks his car in front of her house and serenades
her by playing on his boom box the Peter Gabriel CD recording of "In
Your Eyes."</P>
<P>Since honesty is the key to their relationship, a surprising development
occurs when he lies to her about what he did, even though he did it
solely for her benefit. The IRS investigates her father for making huge
profits due to phony billing procedures at the nursing home and he is
charged with tax evasion, charges that will result in prison time.</P>
<P>The film resolves the relationship she has with the two men in her life,
both of whom she dearly loves, in a very satisfactory and intelligent
way. Finally, we have a teen film that doesn't dumb down its story line
and play it as a goofy teen film. The important thing here is that
everyone was presented in a real way, even the IRS agents were given
more than one dimension, and therefore it meant something to see how the
relationship between the teenage couple developed.</P>
