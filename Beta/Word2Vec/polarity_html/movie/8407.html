<P>     When you consider motion picture concepts that never should make it 
past the planning stage, a dog playing basketball has to be near the top 
of the list (alongside a remake of CASABLANCA and a big-screen version 
of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER).  Nevertheless, because this is Disney, a company 
that's never met a dumb animal movie premise it didn't like, AIR BUD not 
only survived development hell, but emerged to plague the late summer 
box office.</P>
<P>     Someone should consider a law banning Disney from making sports-
related movies.  I still shudder every time I think of their ANGELS IN 
THE OUTFIELD remake.  THE MIGHTY DUCKS movies are the worst examples of 
crass commercialization.  And now there's AIR BUD, which lavishes the 
same kind of sickeningly skewed attention on basketball that the Mouse 
Corporation had previously bestowed upon baseball and hockey.  Somewhere 
along the way, Disney confused "family entertainment" with "mindless 
stupidity."  </P>
<P>     AIR BUD starts out like a severely watered-down version of the 
recent (and infinitely better) SHILOH.  12-year old Josh Framm (Kevin 
Zegers), a newcomer to the quiet town of Fernwell, Washington, makes 
friends with an abused golden retriever.  The dog, named Buddy, has run 
away from its nasty owner, the sniveling Norm Snively (Michael Jeter).  
After proving over a two week period that he is responsible enough to 
care for the dog, Josh is allowed to keep him.  Then, one night, while 
Josh is shooting baskets, Buddy reveals an amazing talent:  the ability 
to sink a lay-up.  Soon, the dog has become the mascot for Josh's school 
basketball team, and, with Buddy's support, they appear headed for the 
finals.  That is, until Snively gets wind of who has his dog, and shows 
up to claim the animal.</P>
<P>     In actuality, the first hour of AIR BUD is watchable, since all 
it's doing is recycling diluted elements from SHILOH and HOOSIERS.  
During the final thirty minutes, however, things become painful (to the 
point where I used the mantra "It's almost over" to keep from walking 
out).  Does Josh's team win the championship?  Does the dog save the 
day?  Does Snively get what he deserves?  Does anyone not know the 
answers to these questions?</P>
<P>     Early during the end credits, AIR BUD makes note of the fact that 
"no special visual effects were used in the filming of the basketball 
sequences."  That's fine, but, to involve me in a movie, something a 
little more impressive is required than a dog that can bounce a ball off 
its nose.  There is no attempt to fashion anything more ambitious or 
interesting than an obligatory storyline around this circus act.  And 
director Charles Martin Smith makes some ill-advised choices in 
developing AIR BUD's tone.  For the most part, the movie is presented as 
a simplistic melodrama that takes itself far too seriously (with 
occasional, unfunny instances of slapstick comedy thrown in at odd 
moments).  A movie featuring a basketball playing dog should probably 
use a somewhat less earnest approach to its subject matter.</P>
<P>     In the acting department, the weakest performer is the human lead, 
Kevin Zegers.  Zegers is adequate at best, but, at a time when there are 
an increasing number of superlative adolescent actors, that's not good 
enough.  In Zegers' defense, however, it should be noted that it's 
difficult to give an effective performance while constantly being 
upstaged by a dog.  Meanwhile, Michael Jeter is irritating as Snively -- 
watching his scenes is akin to enduring someone scraping their 
fingernails across a blackboard.  Bill Cobbs is suitably wise and 
helpful as the school's janitor-turned-coach.  And Wendy Makkena, who is 
best known as one of the singing nuns in Whoopi Goldberg's SISTER ACT, 
radiates maternal sweetness as Josh's mother.</P>
<P>     The screenplay is credited to Aaron Mendelson and Paul Tamasy, and 
it's astonishing that the attention of two writers was needed to fill in 
the blanks of this by-the-numbers script.  Once upon a time, I emerged 
from movies like this thinking that I could easily pen something with 
more originality and intelligence.  What I eventually realized, however, 
was that those qualities are not what studios like Disney are looking 
for in their family fare.  They want familiarity and banality, and AIR 
BUD wears both of those characteristics with the comfort and fit of a 
second skin.</P>
