<P>     According to writer/director Lars von Trier, BREAKING THE WAVES is 
"a simple love story", but "simple" hardly begins to describe this 
deeply disturbing, multi-layered drama.  In fact, nowhere is the 
picture's complexity more evident than in its study of contrasts -- it 
is highly spiritual yet anti-religious, triumphant yet tragic, and 
personal yet universal.  Love forms the film's core, but rather than 
approaching the subject from a cliched perspective, BREAKING THE WAVES 
examines no less than six facets of the emotion:  transformative love, 
sacrificial love, redemptive love, destructive love, romantic love, and 
sexual love.  And, despite a slightly disappointing conclusion, this 
movie still rates among the best of the year.  </P>
<P>     To date, von Trier's best-known international effort was the 1991 
release, ZENTROPA (called EUROPA outside of North America).  Those whose 
familiarity with the director dates to that movie will find BREAKING THE 
WAVES a surprising experience.  Gone are the artistic, stylized flairs 
that dominated ZENTROPA.  The nearly-antiseptic perspective has been 
replaced by something far more involved and intimate.  It's easy to view 
the characters in ZENTROPA from a detached vantage point; a similar 
approach is impossible for BREAKING THE WAVES. </P>
<P>     This epic-length film is divided into nine sections:  a prologue, 
seven "chapters", and an epilogue.  BREAKING THE WAVES transpires 
sometime during the 1970s in Scotland. (The exact year is irrelevant 
since there's a timeless quality to the material -- it could be taking 
place today if the music, clothing, and automobiles didn't argue for an 
earlier decade.)  Most of the action occurs in a closed village with 
deeply-rooted fundamentalist Christian beliefs.  According to the elders 
who rule with an iron fist, life isn't for enjoyment; it's for serving 
God.  Sex isn't for pleasure; it's for procreation.  Outsiders aren't 
welcome; they're consigned to hell.  So when meek, kind-hearted Bess 
(Emily Watson) announces that she intends to marry oil-rig worker Jan 
(Stellan Skarsgard), an unbeliever, the entire community is stunned. </P>
<P>     Despite the stern disapproval of all the elders, the marriage goes 
ahead, and Bess finds herself happier than she ever could have imagined.  
She enjoys sex almost as much as she does the simple joy of lying in her 
snoring husband's arms.  But heartbreak looms ahead.  Jan returns to his 
rig, leaving a lonely Bess behind.  Even her best friend and sister-in-
law, Dorothy (BEFORE THE RAIN's Katrin Cartlidge), can't lift her out of 
her profound depression, but when a local doctor (Adrian Rawlins) is 
called in to evaluate her mental state, he proclaims her sane.  Then 
tragedy strikes as a freak work accident renders Jan paralyzed from the 
neck down. </P>
<P>     Central to the narrative is Bess' relationship with God.  For most 
of the movie, von Trier keeps it ambiguous whether she is psychotic or 
truly involved in some kind of special communion with the Almighty.  
Does she really hear God's voice, or is she exhibiting signs of a split 
personality?  Is she His instrument of salvation, or is she merely 
experiencing potentially self-destructive delusions?  Unfortunately, in 
a late scene, von Trier tips the balance in favor of one interpretation, 
and this dilutes the film's overall impact. </P>
<P>     That said, there's little doubt that von Trier is using BREAKING 
THE WAVES as an opportunity to contrast the elders' rigid, unforgiving 
attitudes with Bess' gentle, giving spirit.  Because her unorthodox 
attempts to save her injured husband involve breaking the Law, she puts 
her status within the community at jeopardy.  To further emphasize the 
strength of her position's spiritual foundation, von Trier parallels 
Bess' sufferings with those of Jesus -- she is condemned by the holders 
of the Law, suffers for the sake of those she loves, and, ultimately, 
offers a path to salvation. </P>
<P>     BREAKING THE WAVES is presented as an excursion in cinema verite.  
Von Trier, in collaboration with cinematographer Robby Muller, uses a 
handheld camera throughout.  In addition, in order to obtain a grainy 
image with muted colors, the film makers took the original widescreen 
print, transferred it to video, then brought it back to film.  So, while 
there are times when BREAKING THE WAVES may threaten to induce nausea 
(especially to those who sit close to the screen), this style 
effectively creates a faux documentary environment that breaches 
invisible barriers and brings us into painfully close contact with the 
characters. </P>
<P>     One area where von Trier errs is in his use of artistic "chapter 
breaks".  Each chapter has a title that's presented during a brief 
intermission from the action which features a richly-hued, painting-like 
image on screen while '70s rock tunes (like Elton John's "Goodbye Yellow 
Brick Road" or David Bowie's "Life on Mars") play in the background.  
The biggest problem with these inserts is that, while they offer a brief 
respite from the film's unrelenting intensity, their interruption of the 
mood becomes an unwanted intrusion. </P>
<P>     As the deeply disturbed Bess, British stage actress Emily Watson 
turns in an award-worthy performance.  Since Bess must endure a number 
of physically and mentally degrading events while her volatile 
personality veers from emotional calm to complete hysteria, Watson's 
task of creating a believable character becomes more difficult as the 
movie progresses.  To her credit, she never falters.  The supporting 
players, including Stellan Skarsgard and Katrin Cartlidge, do fine jobs, 
but none captures the lens the way Watson does. </P>
<P>     There's no denying that BREAKING THE WAVES is a difficult motion 
picture to endure, yet, despite its length, it holds the viewer's 
attention for the full one-hundred fifty-nine minutes.  Excepting the 
chapter breaks, there isn't a wasted moment.  And, if not for a somewhat 
forced catharsis during the epilogue (the weakest segment of the movie), 
BREAKING THE WAVES would have been more wrenching than it is.  This 
achievement announces that von Trier's aptitude for fashioning 
characters equals, if not exceeds, that which he has previously 
displayed for images. </P>
