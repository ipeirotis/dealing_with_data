<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This neglected low-budget B/W noir film from the 1950s is a beaut, an
absolutely superb thriller. It reminds me so much of Jean-Pierre
Melville's great existentialist character studies he presented in his
noir films, such as in Le Samurai (67), where the point of the film
remains less on the story and more on how the protagonist is suave and
calculatingly dispassionate.</P>
<P>"Murder by Contract" is a gritty depiction of a handsome man, Claude
(Vince Edwards), who makes a career move to go from making an honest but
poor living to becoming a contract killer. He considers his work a
business thing, instead of price cutting, he does throat cutting. The
risk is high, but so is the profit. His only personal desire is to
purchase a house by the Ohio River, something he could never afford,
unless he worked all his life and saved. The one who recommends him for
the job is a Mr. Brink, who is unseen throughout the story.</P>
<P>Entering Mr. Moon's (Granger) apartment, he introduces himself as
someone Mr. Brink recommended, even though he has never done a contract
killing before but convinces the reluctant Moon that he is a natural for
this line of work. Moon makes him sweat for two weeks in his hotel room,
as he tells him not to leave the room, he'll call him only one time for
the job, if he's out he'll never call again. Claude exercises when he
gets restless waiting for the call, trying to always be cool.</P>
<P>He does a series of minor killings until he becomes noted as a
proficient contract killer, as we see him use his smarts to kill someone
in a barber shop by pretending to be a barber, he pulls the life-support
machine of another victim, and we see him return to Moon's apartment and
knife him to death, on a contract for Mr. Brink. He will work as a hit
man for anyone who'll pay him, as he develops a reputation for being
efficient and cool under pressure.</P>
<P>Claude accepts an assignment for the huge sum of $5,000 to go out to
Southern California and kill a federal witness in an upcoming mob trial.
He soon learns that the witness is Billie Williams (Caprice Toriel), a
woman piano player who is testifying against Mr. Brink. The two men who
are his contacts in California, the surly Marc (Pine) and the affable
George (Bernardi), want him to get the job done right away, as they fear
if he goofs up, they'll get killed. But Claude takes his time, not
concerned with the two week time period before she testifies. He wants
to see the Pacific Ocean and the other sites in this sunny paradise, and
he also follows the two men to see if they are being tailed. His only
concern is that it is a woman who is the target, not because he cares
about women, but because he considers them unreliable, they never stand
still. He wants double for killing a woman, but the boys refuse to call
the boss and ask, saying that would mean they'll all be dead after the
job.</P>
<P>The job is tougher than Claude realized, as Billie's house is guarded by
the police and she is so scared, she never leaves her house. But he
questions a maid she just fired and learns that she watches TV all
morning. He devises an explosive device attached to the high-voltage
wires that will detonate as soon as she turns on the TV, but she uses a
remote-control and the explosion doesn't kill her.</P>
<P>With just 48 hours to go, Claude comes up with another ingenious scheme,
he has George
shoot a flaming arrow into the outlying brush around her property, which
distracts the police. When a woman opens the door to look out of
curiosity, he kills her with a shot from a high-powered rifle, as he is
perched on a hill above her house. But that woman turns out to be a
policewoman sent in the last moment because Billie wants a woman around
the house. He learns that from a hooker, as he kills some time waiting
for the next train back east. It seems that the police tried to cover up
the botched hit by telling the papers that she died, hoping it would
convince the mob. Claude is ready to give up, saying the woman is a
jinx, you can't go against a jinx or you end up dead.</P>
<P>In the suspenseful conclusion, the amoral Claude deals with the new
situation in his third attempt to kill the witness, in the same
professionally detached and coldly objective way he always deals with
his problems. But first he must kill George and Marc, as he realizes
that the boss wants him killed because he botched the job, even though
it is no fault of his.</P>
<P>This is a perfectly nuanced film, with the atmospheric noir
cinematography by Lucien Ballard, plus a brilliantly appropriate one-man
guitar musical arrangement heard in the background. The film also had a
beautiful feel for who the character is and the situation he was in, as
there were no phony contrivances, as everything about this film felt
natural. They don't make noir films better than this. Interestingly
enough, the director and screenwriter never went on to something even
close to the quality this B film achieved, while this role deservedly
catapulted Vince Edwards career into stardom.</P>
