<P>     THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE, the natural culmination of a '90s revisionist 
Brady fad, is part homage and part parody.  It takes the inimitable clan 
of eight and time-transports them, '70s attitudes and dress style intact, 
into 1995.  Instead of being regarded as the perfect American family, 
they have become outcasts and weirdos.   </P>
<P>     Brady fans will find a lot of familiar things lurking throughout the 
film.  The house has been recreated with excellent care to detail.  The 
new actors resemble the old ones without being dead ringers.  Literally 
hundreds of references to original episodes are included, from the "pork 
chops and applesauce" bit to Marsha's obsession with Davey Jones and 
Greg's attempts to become a rock singer.  Those looking for a nostalgia 
injection will find it here, albeit with such a self-mocking tone that 
some of the truest die-hards may wince. </P>
<P>     The problem with THE BRADY BUNCH is that, satirical or serious, 
ninety minutes is too much.  The first half-hour is clever, breezy, and 
amusing.  The second half hour features a noticeable dip in the level of 
creativity and enjoyability.  The final thirty minutes are a trial.  Past 
the two-thirds mark, I found myself checking my watch almost constantly, 
scarcely able to believe how slowly the "action" was proceeding. </P>
<P>     One of the questions just about everyone is bound to ask is whether 
there are any cameos by the original cast members.  Without revealing 
precisely who, I can say that there are four (one of which happens so 
quickly that if you look away from the screen for a moment, you might 
miss it).  Of course, with the uncanny knack that the new cast has for 
imitating their immortal predecessors, there's little need to keep 
looking for the likes of Florence Henderson. </P>
<P>     The plot is typically Brady-like, with the nasty Mr. Ditmeyer 
(Michael McKean) attempting to buy the Brady house for use in a land deal 
he's cooking up.  When the family has no interest in selling, Ditmeyer 
decides to use nefarious means.  As the story progresses, we spend a 
little time with each of the family members.  Mike (Gary Cole) gives 
long-winded, confused lectures about life's lessons.  Carol (Shelly Long) 
smiles and acts the role of the perfect mom.  Marsha (Christine Taylor) 
and Jan (Jennifer Elise Cox) engage in sibling rivalry, Cindy (Shelly 
Hack) gets taken to task for tattle-telling, Greg (Christopher Daniel 
Barns) tries to become Mr. Rock 'n Roll, Peter (Paul Sutera) copes with a 
changing voice, and Bobby (Jesse Lee) stands by and watches.  Meanwhile, 
Alice (Henrietta Mantel) stays in the kitchen, baking dinner and waiting 
for Sam the butcher. </P>
<P>     THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE almost works, primarily because its creators 
(one of whom is the TV series' originator, Sherwood Schwartz) manage to 
tread the fine line between irreverence and affection.  Ultimately, 
however, the length is the film's undoing.  No matter how tantalizing the 
premise, overexposure leads inevitably to boredom.  THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE 
is good for a heavy dose of nostalgia and several hearty laughs, but not 
much more.  And for those who didn't like the family in the first place, 
this will likely be only a step away from unbearable. </P>
