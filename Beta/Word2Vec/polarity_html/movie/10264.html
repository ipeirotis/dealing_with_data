<P>     It's a truly surreal experience, sitting through a film like AN
AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS with your mind overwhelmed by a piercing cry of
"What were they _thinking_?"  John Landis' 1981 AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN
LONDON was hardly an inviolable classic, but it was crafty and creative, a
comic horror film which was both genuinely scary and genuinely funny. AN
AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS, on the other hand, is genuinely unwatchable --
a collection of bad ideas thrown onto the screen without any apparent
consideration to little details like coherence or appeal to an audience.</P>
<P>     The tragedy is that director Anthony Waller proved he could mix
tension and comic relief quite effectively in his debut feature MUTE
WITNESS.  In PARIS, he merely regurgitates LONDON's premise of Americans
abroad, with protagonist Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) and his
buddies Brad (Vince Vieluf) and Chris (Phil Buckman) replacing backpackers
David Naughton and Griffin Dunne.  The trio is on a "Daredevil Tour" of
Europe, tallying up their respective testosterone points for endangering
their lives or seducing women as college chums are wont to do.  It's not
part of the plan to get tangled up with a den of werewolves, but that's
exactly what happens when Andy saves the life of the suicidal Serafine
(Julie Delpy).  Soon Andy joins the ranks of the wolfen, and must try to
kill the wolf who bit him while also finding a cure for Serafine.</P>
<P>     What follows is so misguided on so many levels that it becomes
horrifying for all the wrong reasons.  The male leads fumble with inane
dialogue including such Gen X-authentic ripostes as "This is madness!";
Julie Delpy, meanwhile, is obliged to humiliate herself with one of the
lamest and most unnecessary nude scenes ever filmed.  The attempts at
humor range from turning a pair of undead characters into fourth-rate
rejects from THE FRIGHTENERS, to the wildly hilarious conceit that Andy --
get this! -- keeps bumping his head on everything in sight.  Waller
directs it all as though guided by the humanitarian desire just to get it
over with, with baffling unexplained resolutions, leading to a
cringe-inducing happy ending which looks like it was stolen from some
mid-80s shlock comedy starring Andrew McCarthy.</P>
<P>     It's all the more aggravating when a film this sloppy pretends to be
interested in making some sort of social statement.  The primary villains
in PARIS are a group of pseudo-skinheads who have intentionally infected
themselves with were-blood so that they might more efficiently rid French
society of its contaminating elements -- vagrants, junkies, American
tourists.  If the point was to make Americans feel better about
encountering mere attitude in Paris rather than flesh-rending canine
teeth, mission accomplished.  If Waller's intent was to offer some
metaphorical indictment of who-knows-what, it's lost in his frantic
story-telling long before we can nod in socially-conscious superiority.</P>
<P>     Some viewers will undoubtedly trek to PARIS simmply to see a genre
film, but even they are likely to be disappointed.  The computer-generated
werewolves are thoroughly unimpressive, and the transformation scene
tossed off so quickly you'll be instantly nostalgic for Rick Baker's
incredible makeup effects from LONDON.  the script makes its token
attempts to spice up the werewolf legend with a few new details and some
pseudo-science, but none of it generates thrills or scares (just a couple
of moderately effective gross-outs).  If they want to add a new twist to
lycanthropic mythology, here's a suggestion:  anyone who makes a werewolf
movie this bad becomes one of them.  The line to fire the silver bullets
forms behind me.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 wolves in cheap clothing:  1.</PRE>
