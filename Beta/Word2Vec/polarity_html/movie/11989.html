<P>        I didn't come into City of Angels expecting greatness. I've
never seen Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, the classic movie upon which
City is loosely based. Then again, I have seen enough stories which are
based upon a similar plot device, with The Little Mermaid (both the
Disney version and the original folktale) being among them, that I had
some high expectations about the possible power such a story of
impossible love can hold. Unfortunately, City of Angels ended up
fulfilling few of them.</P>
<P>        The plot, for those that couldn't tell from the previews,
revolves around the angel Seth, played with an almost creepy intensity
by Nicolas Cage, who, in the midst of his angelic duties, falls in love
with a heart surgeon named Maggie (Meg Ryan in her most endearing
performance since When Harry Met Sally). Of course, his being an angel
prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random
times to talk to her, watch her buy groceries, only to disappear in the
blink of an eye. Their love must remain unrequited unless Seth decides
to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human. Using this framework as
a jumping-off point, the movie attempts to veer through some heavy
philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire, the joys of being
human, and the definition of perfection.</P>
<P>        The first half of the movie succeeds on most points. Cage
excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn't
know feelings so can't really express, preventing the character of Seth
from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and
hang-dog expressions. Unfortunately, Cage takes the intensity too far
sometimes, and then Seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive. As
Maggie, Ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble
coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table
despite having done everything right. Her beauty, unlike her unbearable
cuteness in French Kiss, is mature, intelligent, and winning.</P>
<P>        Likewise, some interesting ideas float around at the beginning
of the film. When the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and
we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the
screen, the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be
an angel. The beautiful camera work, shooting down onto the hectic world
of Los Angeles from the improbable perches of the angels, also gives us
a sense of the unique wonder angels feel.</P>
<P>        The film begins to lose its way, though, when the focus tightens
more and more on Seth and Maggie. The grand, angelic perspective gets
lost, except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of
the world through an angel's eyes. The movie devolves into an
examination of how Seth can't feel the world or, more importantly, he
can't feel Maggie: he can't smell her hair, feel her touch, or taste the
pears she eats.</P>
<P>        This change in focus attempts to capture the audience in Seth's
intense longing, but in doing so, the conflict disappears. If he wants
Maggie so badly, then why doesn't her just make the leap and become
human? After all, what's so great about being an angel? Sure, you get to
sit on Marlboro signs, but what's that compared to getting to be with
Meg Ryan?</P>
<P>        And from there, once the yearning has been established and the
romantic denouement must occur, it's all downhill. The philosophy
becomes heavy-handed, the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep,
and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the
audience's hankie. It's the last thirty minutes of the movie, then, that
wrecks the film. I feel like the writer, by pulling out all the
melodramatic stops, has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely
powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical
level. I came out feeling robbed, seeing so much possibility in a film
becoming nothing. I could go on longer, but I don't want to "ruin" the
end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on.</P>
<P>        City of Angels, then, is a paradox. It's a well-acted
(particularly look for Dennis Franz cutting against type-casting as a
happy-go-lucky fallen angel), well-filmed, and based on a wonderful
idea. All these possibilities, though, are what make the film so
unredeemable when the closing credits come up.</P>
