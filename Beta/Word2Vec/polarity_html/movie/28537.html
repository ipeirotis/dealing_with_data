<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A dazzling and lively fictionalized musical/romantic/comedy about the
notorious Moulin Rouge, which is set during the period between 1899 (the
summer of love) and 1900. It's a fluffy romantic story about doomed
lovers, a courtesan and a penniless writer, living the bohemian
lifestyle, and about a play they put on that needs the support of a rich
nobleman who has a black heart and an evil eye for the courtesan. The
musical numbers are splashy, hijacked from other musicals, and gaudily
presented, befitting such a story set in a notorious Parisian
tourist-trap like the Moulin Rouge nightclub (it was filmed in
Australia). The energy and vitality of these musical scores and a host
of bizarrely dressed supporting performers who fill the stage with song
and dance, gives this film a comical circus flavoring, which manages to
cover-up its cliché-ridden story as much as possible.</P>
<P>It's directed with an eye for color, especially the color of rouge, by
the pop-musical enthusiast, the Australian, Baz Luhrmann ("Romeo and
Juliet"/"Strictly Ballroom"), an MTV type of director, who is more
interested at getting at what dazzles than the why of the dazzle. The
film is a series of perpetual motion shots, never pausing to delve into
any  character study. The problem with that, is you don't really care
what happens to the lovers. The spectacle of the film is the only
substance offered, and its made sumptuously beautiful for the eye to
feast on. It sells its sex in the same way a snake-oil salesman hawks
his product, which results in a tirade for the bohemian motto of truth,
beauty, freedom, and love; but, it only succeeds in making the sex
presented onscreen not live up to expectations.</P>
<P>What excuses this film from being such a rip-off of other films, is that
what is stolen from other films works very well here. It gives the film
all the breathless moments found in other films a chance to breath again
in this whirlwind of a production that is in a constant climax mode. If
all it took was energy and beautiful sets and costumes, then this
production would be a glorious one; but, what this film didn't have was
a love story that could touch the heart, even as it screamed out that it
was all about heart. This is an easy movie to praise for being inventive
and diverting, but it cannot be admired for a film that has a semblance
of truth about it. It's just another enjoyable but forgettable Hollywood
musical, in a long chorus line of such ventures. The film has the feel
in all its excesses of a Ken Russell type of musical crossed with any
number of Hollywood ones, even such an illustrious traditional one as
"Singing in the Rain."</P>
<P>The story is told through the eyes of an English writer (he acts as the
narrator), whose reason for being is to love someone and have that love
returned. Ewan McGregor stars as Christian. He is the young innocent who
leaves behind his uptight father during the French belle époque of the
1890s to live the bohemian life as a writer in Montmartre, Paris.
Pecking away at his typewriter, Christian is startled when a costumed
Argentinean actor falls through the ceiling of his garret and a dwarf
with a lisp, the artist who is now a performing artist, Toulouse-Lautrec
(John Leguizamo), greets him at the door. They have been rehearsing a
stage production called "Spectacular Spectacular," and quickly realize
how talented Christian is and he is hired on the spot to be the play's
new writer. He will also be introduced to the fast track lifestyle of
the bohemians in matters of drink and love.</P>
<P>But there are obstacles in the way of putting on the play in the Moulin
Rouge, which must be met with by trickery by Lautrec (he's the acting
groups' leader). He first inveigles a very private meeting with the
would-be star of the show, the courtesan and headline performer at the
Moulin Rouge, the leggy and sexy Satine (Kidman), and at this meeting
she thinks he's the duke. When she discovers he's not, it's too late,
she has already fallen in love with him. This changes her hardened
personality to one of an innocent girl who sweetly falls in love, a
scenario which the film couldn't convincingly pull off. She will also
have a secret she keeps from Christian, that she's dying from
consumption. The wealthy duke is the heavy in this film. He is played by
Richard Roxburgh, who plays the one-dimensional role as tritely as it is
written. He's got the dough to make the show happen so the impresario of
the dance hall, the colorful liar with the tough exterior but soft
heart, Harold Zidler (Broadbent), entices the duke by setting up a
private liason with him and Satine -- who is also known as "the
Sparkling Diamond." When all the confusion clears, the result is that
the play is sponsored by the duke with the understanding he gets to
sleep with Satine.</P>
<P>The film's gimmick is having 20th century musical songs and routines,
that are eye popping, fill this 19th century set musical. They range
from songs such as: "The Sound of Music," "Your Song," "Diamonds Are a
Girl's Best Friend," "Material Girl," "Smells Like Teen Spirit," "Like a
Virgin," "Lady Marmalade," "Silly Love Songs," "All You Need Is Love,"
"Up Where We Belong," "Don't Leave Me This Way," "Heroes," "In the Name
of Love," and "Roxanne." This is just a partial list of songs, as the
stage is always tuned for some song and dance action.</P>
<P>All the main characters played are the usual stock archetypes--Nicole
Kidman was eye catching as the nightclub star and courtesan who is
really a sweetie for a whore, but she was too physically big to be
handled in a believable way by Ewan McGregor. He's the sensitive writer
type with the pure heart, who falls in love with a woman who makes him
pine for her (at least he stays in character for the entire film). I was
amused by John Leguizamo as the rascal-like Toulouse-Lautrec, and Jim
Broadbent was overpowering in his role as ringmaster of this operation.
He seems to be much too stagy a thespian for these more profane
Hollywood actors he's surrounded by, as he stood out from them because
either he was a much better actor than they were or because he hammed it
up too much. In any case, his performance did stick out like someone who
is thumbing a ride back to Topsy-Turvy. Yet I felt myself partial to his
performance, as in every scene he was in I couldn't help being
overwhelmed by his strong presence; though, Kidman's performance was the
key one of the film. She handles her part in an admirable way, showing
us a lot of leg and feeling for who she was; but, the love story had no
sparks and just didn't work right.</P>
<P>It's a film that looked good (lots of garish colors and stardust),
sounded fine, and felt so-so. A great escape film in the tradition of
Hollywood spectacles, a film that does justice to the cancan dancers of
the Moulin Rouge. It's a fun film to let one's hair down, to sit
leisurely back with some popcorn and watch this film speed across the
screen; while, from time to time peeking in on the jewel-encrusted
elephant that goes for Satine's boudoir, or checking in on McGregor's
impoverished artist's digs as he slaves over the typewriter with an
outside neon sign shining throughout the night (speaking of clichés).</P>
