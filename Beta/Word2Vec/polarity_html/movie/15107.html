<P>     The makers of THE SIEGE probably are throwing up their hands,
baffled by the protests voiced by Arab-American groups.  The basic set-up,
understandably, could hit a nerve:  Arab terrorists, incensed over U.S.
involvement in the disappearance of an Islamic religious/political leader,
begin a massive bombing campaign in New York City.  Initially, a joint
task force led by F.B.I. special agent Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington)
is on the case, but tensions and animosities rise as they are unable to
end the bombings.  Eventually, the President imposes martial law in New
York, charging U.S. Army General William Devereaux (Bruce Willis) with
driving the perpetrators from hiding in Brooklyn's Arab-American community
into the open -- even if it means imprisoning every young male of Arabic
descent to find them.</P>
<P>     You can feel co-writer/director Edward Zwick straining for every
possible opportunity to make it clear that THE SIEGE is _not_ about
Arab-bashing.  Hubbard's partner Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub) is a
Lebanese-born naturalized citizen; representatives from Arab-American
anti-defamation groups stand up in meetings to voice their patriotism and
to denounce terrorism; ominous music accompanies every shot of
Arab-Americans trapped behind barbed wire fences; even the motivations of
the terrorists are traced more to duplicitous U.S. foreign policy
decisions than to fanatacism.  As THE SIEGE builds to a series of speeches
condemning the idea that extremism in the defense of security is no vice,
you know that Zwick wants audiences to feel him championing the notion
that Islam does not equal violent zealotry -- that Arab-Americans are
people too.</P>
<P>     There's one very important thing missing from THE SIEGE, however:  a
genuine connection to the people who are suffering.  The film doesn't
spend a second of personal time with a character actually interned in a
detention camp, nor with individuals tortured by the military for
information, nor with anyone victimized by anti-Arab hate crimes.  They
appear in forlorn masses, in news footage, or hidden behind doors.  Yes,
Shalhoub does get dialogue expressing outrage when his teenage son is
taken prisoner, but the sentiment feels second-hand and token.  During its
final hour, THE SIEGE becomes a thoroughly generic thriller of chases and
speeches -- more interested in being provocative than being empathetic,
and more interested in the _idea_ of trampled rights than those whose
rights are being trampled.</P>
<P>     In fact, it's a shame THE SIEGE had to go there at all, because its
first hour works so well as a crackling police procedure drama.
Washington shares some exceptional scenes with Annette Bening as a
secretive C.I.A. operative whose agenda may be very personal; their
clashing tactics -- the rule of law vs. the rule of expediency -- make for
first rate and surprisingly platitude-free sparring.  Zwick directs the
early action sequences with energy and economy, anchored by the
always-satisfying images of determined people going about a difficult job
with hard-nosed efficiency.</P>
<P>     That exceptional first hour deteriorates into bloated nonsense as
soon as Willis's General Devereaux starts marching his troops across the
Brooklyn Bridge.  Willis himself is a huge part of the problem, taking a
potentially complex character and quickly turning him into a sneering
caricature of military sadism.  Even the fundamental honor and decency
Washington brings to every role starts to seem like sanctimony, because
the script isn't serious about getting into the gray areas of individual
rights vs. societal needs.  The concept deserves more than heroes and
villains pointing guns at each other.  Arab-Americans may be troubled by
the idea that some Arab characters are portrayed as terrorists in THE
SIEGE.  They should be more troubled by the idea that, in a film with such
an incendiary premise, Arab characters in general are more symbolic than
substantial.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 siege mentalities:  5.</PRE>
