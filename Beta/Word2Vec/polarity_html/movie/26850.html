<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A solid noir melodrama from Vincent Sherman, who takes a standard story
and dresses it up with moving characterizations and beautifully
expressionistic B&W photography from cinematographer James Wong Howe.
The director took a songwriter Paul Webster's short magazine story
called "The Man Who Died Twice" and improved the story by rounding out
the characters to give them both strong and weak points, so that they
would not be one-note characters as was the case in the original story.
The film was made by Warner Brothers, who needed a film for their
contract star Ann Sheridan and asked Sherman to change the story around
so that her part as Nora Prentiss, a nightclub singer, is expanded.</P>
<P>The movie posters said, 'If you were Nora Prentiss, would you keep your
mouth shut?' The other famous quote from this film is 'A mouth like hers
is just for kissing...not for telling!' The film proved to be popular
with the public, especially with the women in the audience, and it
turned out to be a big hit for Ann Sheridan.</P>
<P>You can set your clock by the 43-year-old Dr. Richard Talbot (Kent
Smith), as he has never been late to work in the last ten years. He's a
dedicated physician with a comfortable San Francisco lifestyle, whose
life is routine at home and at work. He is married to a bossy wife, Lucy
(Rosemary), who loves him and their two teenager children in her own
prim way, but she can't give him a better life than the dull
conventional one he has. The romance has gone out of their life and the
doctor feels confined, but takes solace in raising his kids and in the
success of his medical practice, where he's a partner with Dr. Joel
Merriam (Bruce Bennett). Talbot is so straight-laced that there is never
a question of him fooling around with another woman, so his wife keeps
busy with either her mother or social causes with friends, allowing him
free time to write for medical journals in order to gain more of a
reputation in his field.</P>
<P>The doctor's life is to change forever on the one day he reported late
to work for the first time and thereby left work for home later than
usual, and as he was crossing the street, an attractive lady gets hit by
a truck. He treats her minor bruises in his office and is taken in by
her alluring sexy ways. She seems to be playing with him, pleased with
his shyness and the attention he shows her, figuring he's so different
from her and the men she knows, that she can get a few laughs at his
awkward flirtations with her. But when he takes an earnest interest in
her and is not put off with her being a chanteuse, things become more
romantic and she becomes afraid that he's the kind of guy she's always
been looking for and that because he's married, he will leave her as
soon as he gets what he wants from her. She is afraid that she will be
the one who is hurt in this romance.</P>
<P>He goes to watch her sing; meets her nightclub boss Nick (Alda), and
begins an affair with her, whereby he starts staying out late at night.
He doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife that he fell in love with
someone else, but when forced into a situation of either telling his
wife or losing her, he decides to tell his wife. But that is the night
his favorite child Bonita is having her "Sweet Sixteen' birthday party,
and he doesn't have the heart to spoil the family celebration. Nora upon
hearing that he couldn't tell his wife, tells him she's leaving that
night for New York to work in the new club Nick is opening there.</P>
<P>As a contrivance to the soap opera plot, a patient of his, Mr. Bailey,
who is a loner, dies of a heart attack in his office. By coincidence, he
is the same age, height, weight, and has the same colored brown hair.
Talbot decides to fake his death by putting his wallet and
identification papers on Bailey and then exploding his car with Bailey
in it. He then flees to New York to live with Nora in her apartment
under an assumed name. But he doesn't go outside of the apartment, after
he reads in the San Francisco newspaper that the district attorney
opened up his case as a homocide.</P>
<P>Back in San Francisco, Dr. Merriam had found a burned letter in Talbot's
office, whose readable part says how desperate he is. He becomes
suspicious, reporting what he found to the police, thinking Talbot might
have committed suicide. But the police say all the proof points to him
being murdered, that he had been blackmailed, as they discover he
emptied out his saving account before the car wreck.</P>
<P>He starts drinking heavily when he sees that Nora is becoming a star and
that his life seems wasted, and he imagines that she is seeing Nick. In
a jealous, drunken fit, he goes after Nick and thinks he killed him. But
he sees a silver lining to his misery when he gets into a car accident
soon after that incident and has his face disfigured, which requires
plastic surgery, making him unrecognizable.</P>
<P>The film was told from the opening flashback, where he is arrested in
New York because of his fingerprint matching the one found in the San
Francisco crime scene and he is brought back to San Francisco to face
murder and blackmail charges. He is told by his lawyer that he better
tell him something in his defense or else he will get the death penalty.
In court his family and friends do not recognize him, but speak of Dr.
Talbot as a fine man. He asks Nora to remain silent, that he'd rather
die convicted of murdering himself, than of having his family think of
him as anything but a nice guy and a good family man.</P>
<P>The glossy story might not be much on paper, but the telling of it was
superb, showing how trapped the main characters became because of their
lie.</P>
