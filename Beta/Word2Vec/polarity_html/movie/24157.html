<P>`The Skulls' is a laughably bad thriller, a teen-orientated doppelganger
of `The Firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a
hypnotic stupor. Certain moments are so preposterous that I nearly
herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter. I chuckled
incessantly, all the way home. Let me share.</P>
<P>The Skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of Yale
(designed, I'm sure, to mirror the actual Skull & Bones from the same
college). Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson), a townie and local varsity
rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year, highlights
the latest Skull scouting report. Despite some anxiety and caution from
others, Luke accepts entry into the organization. Soon after, he finds
himself surrounded by beautiful women, driving a new car and marveling
at the $20, 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account. Yeah, dude,
pretty good deal eh? But Luke soon learns that the membership is
somewhat suffocating; when circumstances become extreme, there is no way
he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable. The
premise, although lacking in originality, certainly offers its share of
potential intrigue and suspense.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, `The Skulls' is neither intriguing, nor suspenseful, nor
anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting. It's just
another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack, the stars....
but not the script. `The Skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of
entertainment value, with the screenplay, by Jon Pogue, immediately
becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers . First off, upon
their initiation into The Skulls, each new member has to have a skull
branded onto their arm. Afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch
that conveniently covers up the scar. Will they never take this watch
off? And what if they forget it by their bedside? Perhaps their ‘secret'
society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand
new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed.
On top of this, they are each given a rulebook and a key to
headquarters. Gee, why not member T-shirts? But my favorite bit is this:
the voting committee for The Skulls does not bother with individual
‘agree' or ‘disagree' notions when making collective decisions. They are
given official Skull paddles. When flipped to one side, they indicate
the member agrees with the proposal. Facing the opposite way means a
disagreement. Wouldn't they merely express themselves verbally? Hell no.
They have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote, and maybe afterward
they can play Ping-Pong.</P>
<P>I'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details, but the humiliating
dialogue is enough to send one into arrest. The cast, meanwhile,
combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `Dawson's Creek'
crowd, and fuses the two together, ensuring that the embarrassment will
be a mutually shared union throughout. But not entirely. Accomplished
actors like Craig T. Nelson (as Skulls chairman Judge Litten Mandrake)
and William Peterson (as fellow board member Senator Levritt) are dealt
pathetic villain caricatures, and look suitably embarrassed handling
them. And then there's Christopher McDonald, who has the capacity to be
a fun, exciting actor. McDonald's charisma is totally diminished here as
he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role (yes, Pogue makes
it a hat-trick). I pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run' exercise
for all these actors.</P>
<P>The young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better. Let's
cut the talented Canadian lad Joshua Jackson some slack for maintaining
believability within the confines of his character. Paul Walker, the
strapping quarterback from `Varsity Blues', is bland but passable as
Caleb Mandrake - the Judge's son. Walker preserves a straight face, even
when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie (`Dad, I just killed a guy
in the ritual room!'). Some actual spark is generated by Leslie Bibb,
who plays Luke's longtime chum Chloe, and manages to successfully pull
off some convincing dramatics. It really boils down to the actors
attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that
cages them from minute one. Or maybe not minute one, thanks to a decent
set-up from director Rob Cohen, who films early sequences with a sense
of atmosphere and style. It makes you wonder why he didn't flee
indefinitely from the project, because while enjoyable cheese like
`Dragonheart' and the moderate Stallone thriller `Daylight' aren't
superior cinema, they belong on the AFI Top 100 list when compared to
this degrading trash.</P>
<P>Aside from unintentionally humoring the audience, `The Skulls' gets
little accomplished. The thrills and action are lazy and mechanical. The
story is stuffed with ridiculous, formulaic plotting that sheepishly
overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick.
Instead of gaining knowledge about The Skulls as an organization, we are
thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed
barnacles from excessive usage. We've seen it all before, and better.
`The Skulls' is a feeble little circus of stupidity, so miscalculated
that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like ‘boneheaded'
seems just too generous.</P>
