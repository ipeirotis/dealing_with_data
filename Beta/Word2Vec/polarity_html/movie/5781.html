<P>     It is a very risky think Robert Altman is attempting in KANSAS CITY,
but then Altman has never shied away from risk.  At the height of the
Vietnam War, he made the darkly anti-establishment MASH; he turned
free-form character study into the brilliant NASHVILLE; he made satires of
the very insider worlds of Hollywood film-making (THE PLAYER) and high
fashion (READY-TO-WEAR).  For the most part, however, those were risks in
subject matter.  In KANSAS CITY, Altman structures his narrative like an
improvisational jazz solo, with a payoff in the final ten minutes that is
a real kicker.  The question is whether he will have lost his audience in
the 100 minutes of riffes which precede it.</P>
<P>     KANSAS CITY takes place over the course of two days in the title city
in 1934 leading up to municipal elections, beginning with the kidnapping
of Carolyn Stilton (Miranda Richardson) by Blondie O'Hara (Jennifer Jason
Leigh).  Carolyn is the wife of Henry Stilton (Michael Murphy), a local
political leader Blondie believes can help her with a serious problem.  It
seems that her husband Johnny (Dermot Mulroney) made the mistake of
robbing a black gambler while wearing blackface, incurring the wrath of
black crime boss Seldom Seen (Harry Belafonte), and Blondie wants Henry to
do whatever is necessary to orchestrate Johnny's safe release.  With the
laudanum-addicted Carolyn as her hostage, Blondie moves through every
level of Kansas City society, waiting for the word which will bring her
Johnny marching home.</P>
<P>     Altman has a very specific image of Kansas City he is trying to get
across, and he accomplishes that task.  It is a city which seems to exist
outside of the time, with races mixing in jazz clubs, liquor flowing
freely despite Prohibition, prosperity still evidenty despite Depression.
It is also a city where the petty corruption of gambling and alcohol
exists side by side with the hard-core corruption of the brutal Democratic
political machine controlled by Tom Pendergast, and where violence was the
real law.  The soundtrack crackles with magnificent jazz tracks, a
constant underscore to brutatlity, and Altman grounds his story in the
city's real history by incorporating Pendergast and a young saxophone
player named Charlie Parker (Albert J. Burnes) into the events fo the
story.</P>
<P>     The product of those elements is a fusion of music, mood and plot in
which the latter often gets short shrift.  Altman has one of his typically
large casts to keep track of, and his shifts back and forth between them
seem to have little to do with pacing.  The encounters between Seldom Seen
and Johnny are basically a series of monologues in which Belafonte's
Seldom holds forth with his captive audience on race relations, the media,
his beloved jazz music and whatever other issue happens to strike his
fancy.  Those speeches are far from riveting -- once you get the point
that he is "seldom seen and often heard," Seldom's sociological
observations simply serve to stall KANSAS CITY.  The same is true of a
sub-plot involving Charlie Parker and a pregnant teen-ager (Ajia Mignon
Johnson) which eventually proves relevant but is largely distracting while
you are waiting.  Even the ostensible main plot, the relationship between
Blondie and Carolyn, is troublesome.  For a long time, it seems to be just
another example of the kind of film I criticized MANNY & LO for being, a
hostage drama in which captor and captive predictably become friends.</P>
<P>     Then, just as I was prepared to give KANSAS CITY up for dead, it
assaulted me with developments so unexpected that they left me breathless.
Suddenly, a performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh which had seemed like just
another one of her mannered stabs at imitating 1930s screen actresses
made beautiful, terrible sense; suddenly, Miranda Richardson's
opium-addled society dame was even funnier and more tragic; suddenly, the
Johnny who had been little more than a piece of furniture during Seldom's
speeches came to life.  After struggling through most of its running time,
KANSAS CITY heads for the finish line in a dead sprint.  The problem is
that by the time Altman begins his kick, he's nearly out of the race.
KANSAS CITY's tale of brutal truths beneath glossy surfaces is the polar
opposite of most of this summer's fare:  it is a film which works far
better when you are thinking about it afterwards than it does while you
are watching it.  I only hope audiences are willing to trust Altman the
risk-taker as long as it takes.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Kansas City chiefs:  7.</PRE>
