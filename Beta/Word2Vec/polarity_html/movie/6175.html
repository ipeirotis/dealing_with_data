<P>     It's tough to find a fresh angle when you're making a movie about
20-somethings and their relationships in 1996, since the last five years
have seen such a glut of such films that you couldn't throw a rock without
hitting one.  Young film-makers may be attempting to follow the Creative
Writing 101 dictum of "write what you know," but in so doing they are
writing what we all have seen enough of by now to know even better than
they do.  SWINGERS appears at first glance to be more of the same, but
it's not really a relationship film.  Instead, screenwriter Jon Favreau
has created what amounts to a comedy with a National Geographic twist, a
charming, almost documentary account of the habits of the North American
human male in the wild.</P>
<P>     Favreau plays Mike Peters, an aspiring stand-up comedian and actor
recently relocated to Los Angeles from New York.  Mike is recovering --
very slowly -- from the end of a six-year relationship, and finding it
very difficult to get back into the swing of dating.  The ultra-cool
atmosphere of L.A.'s hidden nightclubs doesn't make things any easier, not
does the well-intentioned goading of Mike's friends Trent (Vince Vaughn),
Sue (Patrick Van Horn), Rob (Ron Livingston) and Charles (Alex Desert),
who force Mike out into a world of party- and bar-hopping with which they
are far more comfortable than he is.</P>
<P>     SWINGERS is set in the nouveau-hip "cocktail nation" milieu, a
retro-Swing movement which has become all the rage at Hollywood
nightspots.  That setting gives SWINGERS a unique look and vibe, captured
most notably in a scene at the legendary Derby with the band Big Bad
Voodoo Daddy, as well as a unique lexicon (beautiful women are "babies;" a
man who radiates success and confidence is "money").  Director Doug Liman
seems to be working hard to create a sense of place; in fact, he sometimes
seems to be working a bit too hard.  SWINGERS opens with Mike and Trent
taking a road trip to Las Vegas, then proceeds to bounce from location to
location in the name of authenticity.</P>
<P>     The authenticity Liman is going for with those locations is an
authenticity specific to the time and place where SWINGERS is set, and
that is fine, but it is much more winning in its authentic portrayal of
the way men act when they are out in groups and on the prowl.  Vince
Vaughn turns in a priceless performance as Trent, the ladies' man who
makes it his mission to turn Mike into an equally potent dating machine;
there is a great scene in which Trent and Sue, both drunk, watch Mike
trying to pick up a woman (Heather Graham), high-fiving and cheerleading
all the while.  The dynamics of a group of male friends is presented with
a hilariously spot-on realism, with Trent as alpha male directing the
behavior of guys who are little like him, and in fact may not not _like_
him.  That is another aspect of male friendships which is rarely
represented on screen but which is nailed in Favreau's script:  men often
find themselves hanging out with guys with whom they share virtually
nothing in common.  SWINGERS gets its' characters relationships so right
that it is almost frightening.</P>
<P>     It is rather disappointing that so much time is spent on Mike mooning
over his ex, given the stronger kick of the male-bonding scenes.  Jon
Favreau, who looks like a cross between Jay Leno and Steve Guttenberg, is
extremely likeable as Mike, and he gets a few great scenes highlighting
how uncomfortable he is dealing with women, particularly a struggle with
an unforgiving answering machine.  The sad fact is that, like in real
life, spending a lot of time with someone who does little but whine about
his lost love gets to be a bit of a drag.  Mike's extremely tentative
steps toward getting back on the horse are the frame on which the events
in SWINGERS hang, which makes it kind of a necessary evil.  The comedy is
much richer when Favreau, Liman and the cast of SWINGERS take you on
safari, observing a mating dance that is both strange and wonderfully
familiar.</P>
