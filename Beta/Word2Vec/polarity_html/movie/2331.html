<P>"What was [Joy] to me?  She was my daughter and my mother, my pupil and my 
teacher, my subject and my sovereign; and always, holding all these in 
solution, my trusty comrade, friend, shipmate, fellow-soldier.  My mistress; 
but at the same time all that any man friend (and I have good ones) has ever 
been to me.  Perhaps more.  If we had never fallen in love we should have 
none the less been always together, and created a scandal."
                - C. S. Lewis, A GRIEF OBSERVED</P>
<P>     One of England's most admired scholars and authors of the middle
of the twentieth century, C. S. Lewis is known for a wide variety of
literature, including a science fiction trilogy (OUT OF THE SILENT
PLANET, PERELANDRA, and THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH), a fantasy saga (THE
CHRONICLES OF NARNIA), and a number of works as a Christian apologist,
most notably THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS, THE ALLEGORY OF LOVE, MERE
CHRISTIANITY, and A GRIEF OBSERVED.  Born in Northern Ireland in 1898,
Lewis lived almost his entire live in the British Isles, dying in
Oxford on November 22, 1963.</P>
<P>     Lewis, known as Jack to his friends (having never liked his given
name, Clive), met Joy Davidman Gresham in 1952.  The two had
corresponded for some time when Joy arrived in England to escape the
strain of a collapsing marriage.  Over the next several years, Lewis
and Joy met several times, developing and strengthening a friendship.
After her divorce from her husband, she and her two young sons came to
live in London, and when the government refused to renew Joy's
residency permit in 1956, Lewis married her "in name only", so she
could stay.  Early in 1957, Joy was diagnosed as having advanced
cancer, and while she lay in her hospital bed, Lewis confessed his
love, and the pair were subsequently married in a religious ceremony.
When Joy's cancer went into remission, she was allowed to accompany
Lewis home, where they spent two happy years as man and wife until her
death in 1959.</P>
<P>     Richard Attenborough's SHADOWLANDS stays remarkably close to the
true story of C.S. Lewis' relationship with Joy Gresham, taking only
occasional liberties with the material for reasons of pacing, not over-
sentimentalization.  Joy's two sons are "combined" into a single boy,
young Douglas (Joseph Mazzello).  The film ignores Lewis' professorship
at Cambridge, preferring instead to keep him at Oxford, and Joy's final
days are shown spent at Lewis' house rather than in a hospital.</P>
<P>     It's hard to imagine a better choice than Anthony Hopkins for the
lead role.  Chad Walsh, one of Lewis' close associates, described his
friend this way:  "In manner, he was straight to the point.  He was not
given to the sort of chitchat that simply fills in time, though in some
moods he could delight in a battle of verbal wit....  To him, an ideal
conversation was an intellectual fencing match, and may the man with
the best dialectic win.  The few times I crossed swords with him, he
won.  I also noticed that he seemed singularly uninterested in
introspection."  This is the C.S. Lewis that Hopkins brings to life;
the man that we follow from beginning to end in SHADOWLANDS.</P>
<P>     This performance also gives audiences a chance to see a gifted
actor run the gamut of emotions, from disbelieving joy to tortured
grief.  Hopkins never had the chance to express himself the way he does
here in either HOWARDS END or THE REMAINS OF THE DAY.  In many ways,
it's as difficult--if not more so--to give a genuine presentation of
heartfelt emotions than it is to convey their repression.  In
SHADOWLANDS, Hopkins gains this opportunity for release.  Sit back,
watch a master at work, and never once believe that you're not
observing the real C.S. Lewis.</P>
<P>     It's hard not to be eclipsed when playing opposite Hopkins, but
Debra Winger avoids being swallowed in his shadow.  She brings a gritty
worldliness to Joy Gresham that compliments perfectly Lewis'
intellectual spirituality.  Where he is reserved, she is frank and
honest, going so far to remark to a friend of Lewis', "Are you trying
to be offensive, or just merely stupid?"</P>
<P>     Best of all is the chemistry between Winger and Hopkins.  There is
no smouldering sensuality, but they seem very much like a real couple,
and there is no phase of their relationship that doesn't strike a true
chord.  Richard Attenborough knows how to keep the film's tone
appropriate to the subject matter, and the scenes flow together
naturally.</P>
<P>     The supporting cast, although with far less screen time than the
principals, is excellent.  Edward Hardwicke, best known to American
viewers as one of two Watsons in Grenada TV's SHERLOCK HOLMES
mysteries, gives a solid portrayal as Lewis' elder brother, Warnie.
Joseph Mazzello's Douglas introduces us to yet another impressive child
actor.</P>
<P>     As proven by GANDHI, Attenborough is a master of biographical
storytelling.  The failing of CHAPLIN--attempting to cover an entire
life in a two-plus hour film--is avoided here, making SHADOWLANDS an
immensely satisfying, and emotionally rich, motion picture.  This is a
rare tearjerker that rejects manipulation at every level, instead
relying upon narrative and character.</P>
<P>     The initial impression of SHADOWLANDS presented equally by its
creative team and title, may be one of somber austerity, but there is a
great deal of humor, energy, and life to be discovered beyond the
drizzly, often-dreary Oxford landscape.  The photography is beautiful,
but rarely do green vistas upstage the actors.</P>
<P>     To be captivated by SHADOWLANDS, it isn't necessary to have read
Lewis' writings.  The story is self-contained, and William Nicholson's
screenplay (adapted by the author from his own stage play) brings
characters and situations into bas-relief.  The tapestry of this film
successfully weaves together emotion, intellect, and narrative into a
pleasing, but never cloying, whole.</P>
