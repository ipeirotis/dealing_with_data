<PRE>                             MY FATHER THE HERO
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Gerard Depardieu, Katherine Heigl, Dalton James, Faith Prince.
Screenplay:  Francis Veber & Charlie Peters.
Director:  Steve Miner.</P>
<P>     For a while there, I had declared a personal moratorium on
Disney's live-action formula pictures.  Although I found COOL RUNNINGS
moderately entertaining, I realized that was about as much as I could
expect: a smile here, a chuckle there, something I'd take my kids to
see if I had any and wanted to get them out of the house on a Saturday
afternoon.  With the presence of Gerard Depardieu, I had slightly
higher hopes for MY FATHER THE HERO, but I was kidding myself.  While
he lends a roguish charm to the proceedings, he's still trapped in a
movie which seems designed more to divert than to entertain.</P>
<P>     Depardieu plays Andre, a divorced father who has planned a
Bahamian vacation to spend time with his fourteen-year-old daughter
Nicole (Katherine Heigl).  Andre has been mostly absentee in recent
years, and as a result Nicole has developed a rather confused attitude
towards her father.  When she falls for a handsome island resident
(Dalton James), she tries to impress him by concocting a wild story
about her past, including telling him that Andre is her lover.  Word
spreads quickly around the resort, and Andre finds himself tremendously
confused at the reactions he's getting.  Eventually, Andre becomes
privvy to the story, and spins an even more complicated yarn in an
effort to win back his daughter's affections.</P>
<P>     It would be one thing if MY FATHER THE HERO were simply
predictable, which it is, but it is also just badly written.  MY
FATHER THE HERO is based on a French film I have not seen titled MON
PERE, CE HEROS, but it is hard to believe that the characters could
have been as fuzzy as they are here.  We are supposed to understand
that Andre has a selfish streak and a tendency to disappear from
people's lives, asserted by Nicole and emphasized by a telephone
relationship with a girlfriend who doesn't appear until the last scene
(in a cameo which shouldn't be a surprise if you recognize the voice).
However, we never see any indication in his interaction with Nicole
that he is anything but a completely doting father.  It is she who
tries to distance herself from Andre, not the other way around, so her
subsequent string of lies doesn't seem particularly motivated.  The
lies are just a device, and even if we believe it's just adolescence at
work there's no particular reason to care.  One doesn't necessarily
expect well-rounded characters from a film like MY FATHER THE HERO,
but one should at leas find reasonably coherent types.</P>
<P>     Still, as silly and incoherent as the script may be, Gerard
Depardieu still gets to read many of the lines, and he has superb comic
timing.  Once Andre is part of his daughter's fabrication, he plays
some light and clever scenes with the object of her affections, bland
Bill Campbell look-alike Dalton James.  Depardieu has a pleasant
rapport with Katherine Heigl, and with a flirtatious tourist played by
Faith Prince.  But it's part of the problem that he has such a rapport
with everyone; if part of the point is that Andre needs to become a
better father and a more selfless person, we never see any indication
that he is anything but a perfectly nice guy, if slightly
overprotective.  There would have been so many more comic possibilities
in a rakish playboy being saddled with everyone's belief that he is a
cradle-robber.  Heigl is lovely as Nicole, perhaps too lovely; I'm not
sure why she'd need to lie to hook anyone.</P>
<P>     MY FATHER, THE HERO is wholesome, good-natured and does virtually
nothing to offend.  But it needs more than that, namely something to
make it worth ninety minutes of anyone's time.  Gerard Depardieu is fun
to watch, and proves surprisingly adept at physical comedy.  It would
have been nice to see him work with a script that seemed to have any
imagination or sense of structure behind it.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 heroes:  5.</PRE>
