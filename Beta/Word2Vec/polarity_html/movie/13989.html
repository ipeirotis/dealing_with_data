<PRE>Review: Next Stop Wonderland</PRE>
<P>Starring: Hope Davis, Alan Gelfant, Victor Arag, Jon Benjamin</P>
<PRE>Directed by Brad Anderson</PRE>
<P>There are some truly funny lines in Next Stop Wonderland that are
caught up in a battle with forced, trendy screenwriting. It is hard to
tell which comes out on top, and it only manages to provide some
likable characters in an all-too-familiar situation. Erin (Davis) is a
young woman who is shattered when her goofy, activist boyfriend leaves
her because she doesn't support him. She then goes on a quest to meet
Mr. Right by way of her mother placing a personal add against her
will. Erin reluctantly ventures out into the singles world, makes
headway, and eventually starts making sport of the situation.</P>
<P>The film bounces back and forth between two characters who never
meet. Alan, a plumber who is working his way through school to become
a marine biologist, is also not burning up the dating scene. The film
is utterly predictable. We know all along that these two lonley souls
are meant for each other, though they seem unable to meet. Sadly, most
of Alan's screentime is dedicated to the film's subplot of political
muscle, trying to destroy the local aquarium for its prime real
estate. It involves the plans for a mausoleum and killing a
balloonfish. Pretty silly.</P>
<P>The film reminds me quite a bit of Sliding Doors in a number of
ways. Primarily, it deals with fate, Who are we supposed to spend the
rest of our lives with? and, How will we meet this person? There is
also some artsy but jarring camerawork and editing, but it dies down
about a half hour into the film. Strangely, that is when the dialogue
perks up.</P>
<P>Next Stop Wonderland is not a very intriguing film, though it has a
step up on the more unique Sliding Doors in that the characters are
more likable. Hope Davis is really a joy to watch. She has a very
accessable beauty that makes the audience care about her, even if she
is not being particularly charming each moment. There are some truly
funny lines, but they are few and far between. Its a story of two
people looking for romance in the wrong places. It has been my
contention that Hollywood has done a poor job with romantic comedies
in recent years, with, of course, a few exceptions. The indie film
world has done only slightly better, but neither side has managed to
produce a gem. Next Stop Wonderland falls short of the mark too.</P>
