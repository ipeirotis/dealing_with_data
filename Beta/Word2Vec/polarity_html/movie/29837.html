<PRE>BRAVEHEART (1995)
A Film Review
Copyright Dragan Antulov 2001</PRE>
<P>Historical epic as a genre was almost banished from
Hollywood in early 1990s. For many critics, scholars and,
most importantly, film producers, it was a thing of the past
- something that could have attracted crowds only in the era
of black-and-white television and non-CGI special effects.
But in 1995, same as in the case of DANCES WITH WOLVES five
years ago, there came the man who decided to use of all his
energy and talents of actor, producer and director in order
to revitalise that particular genre. And, same as in the
case of DANCES WITH WOLVES, he was awarded for his effort
with "Oscars". The name of the film was BRAVEHEART, and the
name of its director and main actor was Mel Gibson.</P>
<P>The plot chronicles the life of Scottish warlord and folk
hero William Wallace (1272 - 1305). In his time, English
king Edward I "Longshanks" (played by Patrick McGoohan) has
almost completely subdued entire British Isles, including
Scotland, whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by "ius
primae noctis" and various other forms of humiliation and
oppression by English knights. Although English had killed
his father many years ago, young Scottish commoner William
Wallace (played by Mel Gibson) doesn't care about politics
and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride
Murron (played by Catherine MacCormack). Murron's death
changes that and Wallace takes arms and, together with small
but dedicated band of followers, begins guerrilla campaign
that would systematically destroy almost every English
garrison in the country. Through time, more and more people
join his ranks and in 1298 Wallace's rag-tag army scores
surprising victory against English knights in the Battle of
Stirling Bridge. But the newly won freedom is endangered by
the internal squabbles between Scots themselves, especially
nobles under pretender Robert the Bruce (played by Angus
MacFadyen), who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a
national leader.</P>
<P>BRAVEHEART was only the second film in the directorial
career by Mel Gibson, so it wouldn't be fair to compare it
to the better known genre classics directed by David Lean or
Anthony Mann. However, even when we apply such criteria
BRAVEHEART is more than decent historical epic that takes
new and refreshing approach to the genre. The most
noticeable element of this approach is naturalism. While
older Hollywood films set in medieval Europe used to give
fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles, splendid
costumes and knights in shining armour, Gibson shows us the
extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice
where might made right and life was hard, short and brutish.
This general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the
scenes of battle, where hand-to-hand combat is
naturalistically displayed in all its gory details, never
seen since Verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic FLESH & BLOOD.
Compared with this naturalistic approach, most of Old
Hollywood epics look like stage plays. BRAVEHEART also
employs humour at the right places, not only to make bloody
realities of medieval British Isles more bearable to
sensitive audiences, but also to underline its down-to-earth
atmosphere, so different from previous historical epics.</P>
<P>What makes BRAVEHEART "larger than life" is his protagonist.
Mel Gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and
talent in bringing the mythical figure of William Wallace
and, as a result, character of 15th Century poems is
transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th
Century comic book hero. Wallace is more than superior to
his enemies, both physically and mentally, yet he is able to
show his sensitive, more vulnerable side. Naturally, when
the character is based on epic poems, most of historical
accuracy is going down the drain (which was the case with
almost every historical epic from Hollywood in 1990s).
However, even those who don't particularly care about
history or are willing to give poetic license to
scriptwriter Randall Wallace might think that he went over
the top in idolising Wallace, especially in the second part
of film when Scottish superhero manages to seduce Princess
Isabel (played by Sophie Marceau) and make her a child.
Because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended, and final
scenes aren't as effective as they should be.</P>
<P>Mel Gibson as an actor is truly wonderful, and he is also
helped by small army of very good British and Irish actors.
Most memorable of them all is Patrick McGoohan, whose cold,
calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most
effective villains seen in contemporary cinema. Brendan
Gleeson (who would later become famous for his role in
Boorman's GENERAL) is also very good as Wallace's trusted
companion, as well as Ian Bannen is effective as
leprosy-stricken King John Balliol. David O'Harra is very
entertaining as Wallace's Irish ally, and Angus MacFadyen
brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken
character of Robert the Bruce. Women in this film have
rather thankless roles, especially Marceau as
one-dimensional French princess. Catherine McCormack as
Wallace's wife was more interesting, but she was eliminated
from the picture early on. From the technical point of view,
the film is also very good. Photography by John Toll brings
a lot of Scottish natural beauty to the screen. On the other
hand, the musical score by James Horner employs too much of
modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval
times.</P>
<P>Although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike,
BRAVEHEART was often criticised for homophobia and other
forms of extreme conservatism. The main reason for that was
the fact that Gibson, among many historical facts, chose to
be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of
"Longshank"'s son Prince Edward (played by Peter Hanly). He
is not only presented as a villain, but also as one of the
less competent in villain's camp - and portraying of
homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is
almost unforgivable sin in "politically correct" Hollywood.
To make things even more obvious, Good Guys in this film are
the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent Edward -
rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and
efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common
sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower
liberals. However, although the message of this film might
look right-wing, it owes more to leftist ideology of various
national liberation movements in 20th Century. According to
that ideology, oppressed classes (workers, peasants) are
better suited to fight for national freedom because their
members has less to lose in that struggle and, as such, they
are more radical, less willing to make compromises and more
efficient; on the other hand, privileged classes
(aristocracy, bourgeoisie) are more likely to betray the
cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors
in order to keep their privileges. This Marxist worldview is
presented in BRAVEHEART without any subtlety.</P>
<P>In the end, whether the audience is patient enough to
discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy
entertaining historical epic, BRAVEHEART is more than
adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected
genre.</P>
