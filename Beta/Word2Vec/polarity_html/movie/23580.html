<PRE>WAKING THE DEAD
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>WAKING THE DEAD has an unintentionally ironic title.  With exceedingly
bland acting by the leads, Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly, and
lethargic directing by Keith Gordon (A MIDNIGHT CLEAR), the movie is so
comatose that audiences will want to shake it or do something to wake it
up.</P>
<P>Gordon has all of his cast and crew on permanent slow-motion.  People
don't walk, they move at a glacial pace.  Moss could start growing on
their shoes at the rate at which they stroll across the stage.  And the
camera zooms and pans with excruciating slowness as if its gears are
frozen from shooting the film's many snow-covered scenes.</P>
<P>The story, which moves back and forth among several timeframes, concerns
a man who sees dead people, or, more precisely, one dead woman.</P>
<P>Fielding Pierce (Crudup) has a cushy job guarding New York's harbor for
the Coast Guard during the Vietnam War.  He is conflicted since he'd
like to go AWOL to Canada to protest the war but worries that it might
upset his ambition to be the President of the United States.  One
certainly couldn't be elected president, he reasons, after a visible
protest against one's own country.</P>
<P>Fielding's girlfriend, Sarah Williams (Connelly), is an anti-war
activist who encourages him to leave the country.  A few years later,
she is killed in Chile, where she has gone as part of the Sanctuary
movement.  After that, he follows a political career, while the dead
Sarah keeps making guest appearances in his life.</P>
<P>The problem is that the plot's realization isn't the least bit
convincing.  Never do Fielding or Sarah seem genuinely interested in any
of their causes or aspirations.  Both show all of the emotive power of a
stone.  It isn't clear how Fielding could get any votes, much less get
elected.  He is an empty suit without any issues or even a decent stump
speech.  Sarah says that she's committed to her causes, but shows no
authentic spark of compassion for the people to whom she devotes
herself.</P>
<P>This leaves the movie to succeed or die based just on their love affair,
which turns out to be the weakest link of all.  Only when having sex do
these lovers ever appear the least bit romantically inclined.  At other
times, they say the right words, but their vacant eyes show they are
just reading their lines.</P>
<P>"If anybody really knew Kennedy, do you think they'd have ever voted for
him?" Fielding's father asks him.  The story implies that politicians
must never reveal themselves to us if they want to get elected.  The
movie takes the same reticent approach, giving us trite speeches but
little more.  I'd recommend that you vote against it.</P>
<P>WAKING THE DEAD runs 1:45.  It is rated R for sexuality and language and
would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
