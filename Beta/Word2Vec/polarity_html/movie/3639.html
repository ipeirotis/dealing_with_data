<P>     Perhaps the best way to describe the third segment in the popular 
DIE HARD series is by comparing it to the previous two.  That should 
give an adequate assessment of how far the adventures of John McClane 
(Bruce Willis) have fallen.  The original DIE HARD took place in the 
confined space of a high rise building.  The first sequel widened the 
field to an airport.  This one zigs and zags all across New York City.  
Apparently, the greater the scope, the less engaging the movie.  Then 
there's the character of Holly McClane, played with warmth and appeal by 
Bonnie Bedelia.  She and John had a lot of interaction in the original.  
In part two, they were separated by the few thousand feet, but she was 
still there, circling Dulles International Airport in a plane low on 
fuel.  In DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE, Holly is nowhere to be seen.  These 
things, amongst larger issues (like script quality), help explain why 
the second DIE HARD wasn't quite as good as the first, and why this 
installment doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the 
1988 and 1990 episodes.   </P>
<P>     When formulating a sequel, the film makers should attempt to 
recapture the style of their movie's predecessor without regurgitating 
specific plot twists.  While DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE transpires in a 
vastly different setting than the first, that doesn't prevent it from 
shameless pilfering.  One chief "surprise" this time around is nearly 
identical to an element of the original.  There are also fragments 
borrowed liberally from the likes of SPEED and BLOWN AWAY (not 
surprising, considering that those pictures, like this one, deal with 
mad bombers).  And, of course, coming in the wake of the Oklahoma City 
tragedy, there are times when the explosive excesses of this film seem 
in bad taste, even though it was in the can long before that April 
morning. </P>
<P>     In the first two DIE HARDs, John McClane was an ordinary Joe caught 
in extraordinary circumstances -- a hard-working cop trying to save the 
lives of his wife and whole lot of other people on Christmas Eve.  Now, 
McClane is one step from alcoholism, Holly is living on the opposite 
coast, and it's the middle of the summer.  There's a guy out there 
called Simon (Jeremy Irons) bombing buildings, and he wants to play a 
game of "Simon Says" with McClane.  Each time he gives an instruction, 
it has to be carried out or some new target will be blown to 
smithereens.  Along the way, McClane picks up an ally in a Harlem shop 
owner named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), who gets involved when he saves 
McClane from a street gang.  Simon makes Zeus part of the cat-and-mouse 
game which turns into a wild goose chase.  There's a bomb in one of over 
1400 New York schools, and it's up to McClane to find out which one. </P>
<P>     John McTiernan, the director of the first DIE HARD, is a great 
crafter of action sequences.  All the explosions and fights are filmed 
with consummate skill, and are thrilling in their own right.  But that's 
where it stops.  The pacing is erratic and the level of tension ebbs and 
flows.  While parts one and two built momentum to an exhausting, 
exhilarating climax, part three has too many peaks and valleys (and, it 
seems, more of the latter than the former).  Worst of all, the hero 
doesn't have to be John McClane.  It could be any hungover cop able to 
utter a few, widely-spaced one-liners. </P>
<P>     Samuel L. Jackson, one of the best actors around today, rises above 
the material.  Even more often than Willis, he is the central 
attraction.  Jeremy Irons is no better than adequate as the suave 
villain.  The nature of his character automatically resurrects the ghost 
of Alan Rickman's first-part antagonist, but it's not a favorable 
comparison.  Of course, Irons is handicapped because Simon doesn't 
appear in the flesh until half-way through this film.  Meanwhile, Graham 
Greene is horribly underused as just another face in a crowd of one-
dimensional cops. </P>
<P>     After the second DIE HARD, Bruce Willis stated he would never do 
another.  He should have stayed firm in his resolve.  If quality is any 
indication (and it may be, with all the available blockbusters), box 
office returns will be disappointing this time around and, if nothing 
else, that will do to John McClane what dozens of assorted bad guys 
couldn't manage:  kill him. </P>
