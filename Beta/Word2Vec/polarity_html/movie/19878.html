<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A student of forensic medicine, the son of a deceased French diplomat,
Mathias Barillet (Emmanuel Salinger), coming with his youthful diplomat
friend, Jean-Jacques (Thibault ), by train from Germany to Paris, is
stopped at the border and searched by the border guards and grilled by a
mysterious man who expresses a mean-spirited resentment against him.
When he returns to his Paris hotel, he finds a severed head in his
suitcase. Why he doesn't turn the head over to the police, the most
logical thing in the world to do, is never fully explained to my
satisfaction. But this espionage thriller, picking up on the theme of
the Cold War, will be about his searching for the identity of the head
and its possible connection to the man who harshly interrogated him on
the train.</P>
<P>He visits his sister Marie (Marianne Denicourt), who is rehearsing
classical songs for her upcoming opera recital and possible trip to
Russia. The opera company is run by Jean-Jacques' boss, Varins (Jean-Luc
Boutte), a seemingly controlling figure, choosing to remain in the
background. Here, Mathias will be introduced into the drab world of the
underlings who keep the spy system going, something his father did but
what he chooses not to do. Needing a place to live, he teams up with
another diplomat he is introduced to at the rehearsal, a more forceful
type than he is, William (Bruno), and they rent a large apartment, which
is strictly divided in half, like the Berlin Wall, with no encroachment
allowed without special permission.</P>
<P>There is also an attempt at romance with the head pathologist's elusive
daughter, Claude (Devos), where the opposites try and mesh; at least,
he, representing the very sober field of science, wants a relationship
with the carefree art student, who prefers a different type of guy, to
his chagrin.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, in slow-time, it becomes apparent that there is some kind of
political corruption going on by the diplomats he knows in Paris and by
his interrogator, who is now identified as a double-agent by the name of
Bleicher (Jean-Louis Richard). He is someone upset with the government's
appeasement of the communists. All this spy business was rather vaguely
done, and gave no particular credence to the story, except it did show a
large vacuousness among the young as to their country's recent history.
What the film couldn't do, was make all this interesting and tangible to
the story it was telling. A story which threw out many possible
situations, but never delved fully into them. So what remains, is a
naive medical student, with friends and a sister he has alienated, and a
mystery story that has no great payoff for the 2 1/4 hours it took to
tell it. Yet it was somewhat diverting as a study of the students and
their attitudes. The Russian scientist's severed head is used as a
symbol for the Cold War and is dissected by the medical student and
shown to be part of the cloak-and-dagger game played by both sides,
which still goes on, because enemies are needed to assert the
righteousness of one side over the other.</P>
<P>The naive hero is not convincing enough in his role as a seeker of
justice and the film as a political thriller suffers from a lack of
focused direction. What is absorbing, is the psychological mood of the
students shown and how they view their place in a possibly united
Europe. It was a good idea for a film, that tried to show that
metaphorically opposites might attract but can't stay together, but it
was too poorly executed for one to sustain an interest in its long drawn
out meandering story.</P>
