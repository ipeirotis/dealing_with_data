<PRE>                                  DISCLOSURE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Michael Douglas, Demi Moore, Donald Sutherland, Roma
Maffia, Caroline Goodall.
Screenplay:  Paul Attanasio.
Director:  Barry Levinson.</P>
<P>     You know that Angry White Male we've all been hearing so much
about since the November election?  Well, I've just figured it out:
he's Michael Douglas.  Ever since FATAL ATTRACTION in 1987, Douglas has
seemed to be there every time a film exploded into an infuriating
zeitgeist phenomenon, and Douglas himself has mastered the role of the
somewhat-less-than-innocent victim.  Team him up with a novel by
cautionary tale king Michael Crichton, and you have DISCLOSURE.  What
you don't have is anything nearly as controversial as it might first
appear to be.  While it is well-paced and generally entertaining, it
tries so hard to be everything for everyone that it misses the chance
to be genuinely incendiary.</P>
<P>     Douglas plays Tom Sanders, an executive in a Seattle computer
company with a wife, two children and--he believes--great career
prospects.  However, on the day that he thinks he is to get a big
promotion, he finds that the position has gone to Meredith Johnson
(Demi Moore), an ambitious young exec who also happens to be a former
lover of Tom's.  He is bothered by the slight, but nowhere near as
bothered as he is when an after-hours meeting with Meredith gets
extremely steamy.  Tom ultimately resists temptation, but Meredith is
not pleased.  The next morning, Tom learns that Meredith has accused
him of sexual harrassment, and that the company president (Donald
Sutherland) wants him to take a transfer quietly.  But Tom will have
none of it, and hires a media-savvy attorney (Roma Maffia) in an
attempt to make the tough case that a man has been sexually harrassed
by a woman.</P>
<P>     Those familiar with other Michael Crichton works (JURASSIC PARK,
RISING SUN) will not be stunned to learn that the characters in
DISCLOSURE are stick figures; I somehow suspect that if Crichton could
figure out a plot that didn't require human beings, he'd jump on it in
a minute.  A Crichton plot is a Plot with a capital "P," and DISCLOSURE
is no exception.  It's dense with twists, turns and intrigue, perhaps
too dense for a screen adaptation ever to cover thoroughly enough.
Discoveries which Tom was able to make in the novel through his own
resourcefulness are reduced to conveniently (and absurdly) overheard
conversations in the film.  Because there is so much ground to cover,
director Barry Levinson keeps the film moving like a rocket, and it
could leave some viewers struggling to keep up.</P>
<P>     Credit screenwriter Paul Attanasio (QUIZ SHOW) with making it work
as well as it does.  While there is very little he can do with
Meredith's character, he does give Tom a slightly shadier personality
so that his experience becomes something of a comeuppance.  He also
creates some marveous dialogue which may be DISCLOSURE's strongest
asset.  Donald Sutherland gets some of the choicest lines, such as
dismissing the notion that Tom would accept a transfer to a division
rumored to be on the chopping block:  "That would be like a duck
accepting a transfer to a l'orange."  Comic Dennis Miller is also sharp
as one of Tom's co-workers, but I suspect that many of his best lines
were his own creations.  Attanasio's work is efficient and clever, and
it makes DISCLOSURE engaging most of the time.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, Attanasio also appears to have been given orders to
give every possible side of the story equal time, and it is when
DISCLOSURE becomes a high school debate that it becomes tiresome.
Crichton's novel was unapologetic about the role-reversal in the sexual
harrassment story, since to him it was simply a plot device in a
corporate thriller.  The film, on the other hand, both tries to be
*about* sexual harrassment and to avoid appearing as reactionary as
Crichton, and gives everyone a chance to make a speech.  In a story as
tightly constructed as DISCLOSURE, the dueling pontifications are a
real time drain.  DISCLOSURE is a slick, well- photographed film, and
it's nice to see Levinson directing a winner after the twin bombs TOYS
and JIMMY HOLLYWOOD.  Still, it could have been much more effective had
it spent less time chewing its nails over how politically correct it
wanted to be.</P>
