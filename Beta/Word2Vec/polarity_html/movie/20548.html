<P>Does America love baseball? Has Kevin Costner had box-office hits 
with the baseball films Bull Durham and Field of Dreams? Has been 
unlucky with  some recent movies --except for Tin Cup where he plays 
a golfer? Is The Pope Catholic?</P>
<P>So it made good sense to do a third baseball picture. He is Billy 
Chapel, the Detroit Tigers ace pitcher and prime Hall of Fame 
candidate. Now he's in New York for a game at Yankee Stadium. His 
shoulder hurts. His soul hurts as he is told that his team is being 
sold. He's 40, getting older by sports standards. He has 19 years of 
pro playing behind him. And his heart is breaking because his girl, 
magazine writer Jane (Kelly Preston)  announces that it's all over 
between them; that he really needs no one; that his real love is 
baseball; that  in a few hours she's off to England where a dream-job 
is expecting her.</P>
<P>That's the set-up. From here on out it's flashbacks and flashforwards 
that would be artsy and tiresome (but can be a tad tiring)  except 
that Sam Raimi --who directed The Evil Dead but caught us by surprise 
in 1998 with the so-different A Simple Plan-- manages his script and 
his team (of actors) with a sure-hand and an obvious passion for The 
Game.</P>
<P>Five years ago Billy and Jane first met. They met cute, but it's 
funny and fresh. Their relationship is charted back and forth, 
surprises abound, there's even a surprise young girl, Heather (Jena 
Malone) who livens, warms up and helps crystallize the lovers' 
on-off relationship. More, I cannot say, since this is sports movie 
but also a character-driven picture. It has its own levels of 
suspense, in personal and in sports matters.</P>
<P>There are some clever inventions (events, scenes, sequences), whether 
in rainy New York, sunny Florida or the snowy West. The plot is 
highly manipulative of course, as it plays with the characters' 
actions and reactions, and with the audience's response to what is 
on the screen. The tricks of the trade, both filmic and baseballic, 
are out in force. But they are well handled, keep your attention and 
do not ever get boring. Even the music score by Greek-American 
Poledouris, though generic/romantic, skirts the bombastic repetitions 
by Greek-Greek composer Vangelis in that popular sports-movie 
Chariots of Fire.</P>
<P>All this would still be high-class routine stuff, were it not for the 
superb scenes in the ballpark, their mise-en-scene, their 
photography, the realistically filmed crowds : excellent, imaginative 
photography, sound-mixes, editing that coordinates people and actions 
in the diamond and off it. We get the players, the raucous fans, and 
we get the iffy  but touching thoughts of Billy during his mind games 
with the opponents. He's fighting (under physical and psychological 
handicaps) for his team, his good name, and his exit from the Tigers 
(he'll be traded, no matter what happens).</P>
<P>The movie treats its players with a glove (not kid, but still), as we 
only see and hear rather comradely things with no trace of 
locker-roomitis. The closest to a nasty presence is a young Yankees 
batter who looks satanic. Billy foils him again and again. But the 
game is a gem of excitement and suspense.</P>
<P>The players (in both senses) are very good, although there is no true 
depth in the affair, the setbacks and the Fun With Bill and Jane. 
Costner has the right physique for the role, but it  does get a bit 
redundant as we watch him suffer. Kelly Preston is convincing as a 
real person, as opposed to one playing a part. She does not want to 
be a groupie, but the presumed intensity of the affair is made 
somewhat ho-hum by three things: the lightning fast, out-of-character 
(hers) speed of her initial sex with Billy; our knowledge that so 
many male sports figures are incorrigible woman-collectors; and the 
studio-imposed carnal cuts in order to get a PG-13 rating. Young Jena 
Malone is beautifully cast as she matches perfectly Preston's looks.</P>
<P>The winningest side of the film is the great edge-of-the-seat footage 
which works both on baseball lovers and on non-aficionados.</P>
