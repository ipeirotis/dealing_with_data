<P>GETTYSBURG, Ronald F. Maxwell's re-telling of four hot days during the 
summer of 1863 (based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel THE KILLER 
ANGELS by Michael Shaara), is a grand movie that gathers power and 
momentum with every moment.  In fact, after having viewed this spectacle 
in a theater, I have difficulty envisioning how its impact could be close 
to the same on the small screen.  This is perhaps surprising considering 
that GETTYSBURG was originally intended to be a TNT mini-series, and 
only after its completion, when Ted Turner realized the quality of the 
material he had on his hands, was the decision made to go for a 
theatrical run first.  Those who are not daunted by the running time 
(two-hundred thirty-four minutes, easily the longest general release 
motion picture in a long while) will be grateful for the decision.</P>
<P>The film is divided into two parts, with an intermission in between (the 
length of the intermission varies from ten minutes to twenty-five 
minutes, depending on theater management).  The first section, which 
begins on June 30, 1863 (the day before the start of the battle of 
Gettysburgh) and ends during the day of July 2 with Col. Joshua 
Chamberlain's legendary defense of Little Round Top, is approximately two 
hours and twenty minutes long.  The second part, which takes up the 
remaining 1:55, concentrates primarily on July 3 and the disastrous 
charge of Maj. Gen. George Pickett and 15,000 members of the Confederate 
Army against the entrenched Union position atop Cemetery Ridge.  </P>
<P>Over 50,000 were killed or wounded during this pivotal battle of the 
Civil War, and GETTYSBURG takes pains to breathe life and logic into the 
reasons for this.  Yet it does far more than that.  Rather than 
functioning as a text book come to life, the film uses its actors to 
flesh out characters from history, giving not only personalities to those 
on both sides of the struggle, but believable causes as well.  We are 
presented with the rare opportunity to see not only the clash of arms on 
the field of battle, but the clash of wills before it.</P>
<P>In what it manages to do, GETTYSBURG is an exceptional motion picture, 
but this is true even moreso for the manner in which it manages to do it.  
Four and a half hours (including the intermission) is a long time to sit 
in a movie theater, yet even towards the end, restlessness is unlikely.  
The film is adept at the tricky art of pacing, and just as the slower, 
dramatic elements of the story threaten to bog down GETTYSBURG, the 
rousing battle scenes start anew.</P>
<P>The film opens with exposition and introduction.  Coming at the beginning 
as it does, this sequence isn't difficult to get through.  Next is the 
initial confrontation between the troops of Gen. Buford (Sam Elliot) and 
the advancing edge of the Confederate army.  Then, with the onset of 
night, there's a lull, and an opportunity for more character development 
and introspection.  With the morning of July 2, there's the defense of 
Little Roundtop under the command of Col. Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels), a 
truly amazing sequence that lasts nearly an hour and keeps the audience 
involved and enthralled for the entire time.  When the intermission 
occurs, it hardly seems possible that the film is more than half over.</P>
<P>Of course, following Little Round Top, there's discussion and planning as 
Gen. Lee (Martin Sheen) prepares his decisive assault.  The disagreements 
of Lt. Gen Longstreet (Tom Berenger) are presented and ignored, and 
Pickett (Stephen Lang) is chosen to lead the charge.  While this section 
of the film may be a little too talky, it is positioned immediately after 
the intermission when the audience is better able to tolerate a slower 
forty minutes.  The climax - Pickett's charge - is even more engrossing 
than the defense of Little Round Top, if that's possible.  Those who get 
a few nape hairs standing on end will not be alone.</P>
<P>Historical accuracy was of great concern to the producers and director.  
They hired a veritable army of advisors to correct even the most minute 
mistakes in the script (if a general given a pale horse in the movie was 
known to have favored a dark horse, the steed was changed), used the 
actual sites in Pennsylvania as often as possible (where hiding war 
monuments became an art), and "recruited" more than 5000 unpaid re-
enactors to fill up the screen during the battle scenes (thus helping to 
keep the budget at a reasonable $20 million).  The result is a movie that 
looks - and feels - real.</P>
<P>Admittedly, the battles are not as stunning or well-choreographed as 
those in GLORY, but this doesn't damage the effectiveness of the film, 
since GETTYSBURG's clashes are still impressive  GLORY's R-rating and 
narrower focus allowed it to have spectacular battle sequences (the same 
is true of the 1700s drama THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS).  GETTYSBURG, a far 
more ambitious project, had two major handicaps:  limiting the brutality 
of its depiction for the PG-rating, and getting far more extras into 
position (the logistics of this picture must have been a nightmare).  
Additionally, the camerawork in Edward Zwick's magnificent drama had a 
more grand scope than Kees Van Oostrum's work here (although, to Van 
Oostrum's credit, there are a number of breathtaking shots - most of 
which occur after the battles, however).</P>
<P>The cast gathered for this recreation is impressive.  There are no high-
orbit names like Tom Cruise or Alec Baldwin to distract the viewer.  
While Berenger and Sheen are certainly known and recognized, their 
profiles, like their performances, are low-key.  Both do solid jobs, and 
are especially effective at bringing out the more human sides of the 
officers.  Sheen's Lee is a brilliant leader who carries a weight of 
weariness and guilt that only the end of the war can lift, and Berenger's 
Longstreet has tears in his eyes when he orders Pickett's charge, which 
he knows beforehand will be a failure.</P>
<P>More impressive than Berenger and Sheen are Jeff Daniels and the late 
Richard Jordan.  Daniels gives a remarkable rendering of Col. 
Chamberlain, investing the legend with all the foibles and failures of 
humanity, and making us understand exactly why his name has been so 
lauded.  Jordan, who plays Brig. Gen. Lewis Armstead, is the standout on 
the Confederate side, and his powerful portrayal is given an added dash 
of poignancy by the realization that the actor is no longer with us.</P>
<P>In epic movies, especially those that feature battles, the musical score 
takes on added significance.  While not a masterpiece of originality or 
modern composition, Randy Edelman's work is loud, triumphant, and 
inspirational - qualities which are perfect for the battle scenes.  Not 
as effective are his themes for the quieter, more dramatic moments.</P>
<P>Could GETTYSBURG have been shorter?  There are probably a few sequences 
that might have been trimmed without doing much damage, but the finished 
product would still have been around four hours.  Further cutting would 
have reduced either the spectacle of the battles or the insight into 
certain characters, neither of which would have been desirable.  All 
things considered, this film is close to the perfect length.</P>
<P>Epic motion pictures are a rarity these days - even more rare than films 
about the Civil War.  GETTYSBURG should satisfy both cravings, at least 
for a while.  This film is perfectly placed in the wake of Ken Burns' PBS 
series (Burns, incidentally, has a small role here as the aide to Union 
Gen. Hancock) for any who have a re-kindled interest in this segment of 
American history.  For those with little more than a passing interest, 
GETTYSBURG is still gripping enough to captivate in its own right.  
Ambitious and successful, it is easily one of the most glorious U. S. 
productions of the year.  </P>
