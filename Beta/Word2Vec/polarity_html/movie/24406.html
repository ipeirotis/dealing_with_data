<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A powerfully haunting film, that should leave one with some deep
emotional pains over its human drama or turn one completely off by its
obvious political intentions. It is an outstanding debut directorial
effort by the Chinese-born actress Joan Chen (The Last Emperor), who
filmed this political expose fable in China, near the Tibetan border on
the steppes, without the official permission of the Chinese government.
This is a banned film in China and one that they will be unlikely to be
showing there for quite awhile, as its negative reactions to Mao's
Cultural Revolution from 1967-1976, is a blanket indictment against
China's attempt at mass indoctrination. The film shows this cultural
experiment to be rife with incompetency, corruption, bureaucratic
irresponsibility, and poor planning.</P>
<P>The Revolution was an attempt at reeducating the bourgeois masses in the
city by means of removing over seven million students from their city
families and placing them in the country's rural provinces for mostly
agricultural and factory training. Those with family connections to
party officials or who paid off the right officials were not taken.</P>
<P>The film tells its tale as a coming-of-age story about a naive
15-year-old Chengdu city girl, Wen Xiu (Lu Lu); Xiu Xiu is her nickname.
The story is set in 1975, during China's Cultural Revolution, when she
is removed from her poor but loving family consisting of a mother and
father and younger sister (her father is a tailor and makes her
clothes). She is assigned to hard labor and after a year of outstanding
service, she is transferred for no apparent reason, for a six months
term to live on the remote plains of Tibet with Lao Jin (Lopsang), a
middle-aged Tibetan master horse trainer and herder, where she is to be
prepared to ride with the Educated Youth in the elite Iron Girls'
Cavalry. It is later on learned that this group doesn't exist anymore.
The film shows her going through no training, as the herder is gone all
day and she seems to be mostly looking through the kaleidoscope a young
potential boyfriend gave her back in Chengdu as a parting gift.</P>
<P>The unusual relationship between the spirited Xiu Xiu and Lao Jin, who
was emasculated in a tribal war and therefore is deemed safe for her to
live with, is the heart and soul of the film. He is a Tibetan nomad, not
much of a talker, more of an animal lover than a people person, someone
quite used to being alone, and quite able to survive in the wilderness,
which makes him an unusual choice as a teacher. For him, one place is
like another, so it makes no difference that he is in so barren a
region.</P>
<P>He takes his task to heart and watches out for her as best he can while
secretly he develops an affection for her, as he watches her change from
a homesick and modest young girl to someone who is absolutely tormented
to be where she is, feeling imprisoned living in this raggedy tent in
the great outdoors, doing something this educated girl has no use for.
It is sheer madness the way this program is administered and carried
out, whereas no one comes for her when her time is up and there is no
one there to tell her anything. That she panics, thinking she will be
left here for good, is understandable. The film shows by comparing her
mood swings to the natural surroundings, the vast and changing sky, how
small she feels, how it has sunk into her how far apart she is from the
things she loves to do and how much she misses her warm family. In one
scene, it shows her getting dressed up in her best blouse and scarf for
the officials to come and get her after her six months were up, as she
counted off the days, but no one comes. By contrast, it is shown how
comfortable Lao Jin is here. After all, he didn't have to relocate to a
city.</P>
<P>The film is narrated in an incredulous voice by a young man, Luoyong
Wang, the one who longed to be her boyfriend and who is hopeful that she
will return, but not hopeful that he will hear from her again. He is not
sent away because he has family connections.</P>
<P>The power of the film is that it plays out an unsettling relationship
between the innocent virgin Xiu Xiu, who at first is too bashful to
undress before the older man, and then, out of desperation, she meets a
number of men who pretend to have influence at the local communist
headquarters and they mislead her into believing that they will use that
influence to get her back to Chengdu. She has sex with them and thinks
she is using them as a necessary means to help herself. She also gets to
act like a bitch, flaunting her sex in front of the embarrassed herder,
who, at one point, calls her a whore. She has spoiled the pure
relationship she had with Lao Jin, who is only trying to find a way to
help her out of her desperate situation, but is too socially deficient
to know how to help. It is a most interesting performance by this
16-year-old actress, Lu Lu, which gets the audience feeling sorry for
her, but at the same time, feeling annoyed that she acts so badly
against the saintly herder.</P>
<P>Equally effective is Lopsang as Lao Jin, someone who is crippled by his
sexual inability to perform and can't protect the girl from her sexual
predators, even though he wanted to. His acting is seen through the hurt
on his face and the gestures he makes that reflect how he is both
paternal to her and burning with desire for her. But he is ineffective
in dealing with people, as long ago he has given up making relations and
carrying on small talk. By the end of the film, he realizes that he
can't save the girl and his pained heart is apparent. It is a uniquely
masterful performance, that seldom gets translated on the screen in such
a true way as it does here.</P>
<P>The flaw in the film, comes with its bleak ending, that seemed to be
contrived and used as a means of getting more sympathy out of the
audience than it needed to. It took away from the impact of this strange
relationship, that had been mesmerizing and touching in a very real way.
It returned the film to the heavy-handed symbolic message it had
succeeded in avoiding through the telling of its energetic human drama.
The beautiful camera shots of the landscape and the poetry of the girl's
loss of innocence, were undermined to a certain degree by how this
allegory unfolded. Xiu Xiu's story is sad one, but one wonders if it was
really so overwhelming as it is portrayed here. Nevertheless, this was a
substantial film, that had its heart in the right place and offers a
story that is of a superior quality. Overall, a splendid effort is
achieved.</P>
