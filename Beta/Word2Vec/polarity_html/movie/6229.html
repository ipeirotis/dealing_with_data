<P>     These days, whenever a new picture comes out with one of the old 
Zucker-Abrams-Zucker crew's name attached to it, it's easy to wax 
nostalgic for films like AIRPLANE! and THE NAKED GUN.  Those mvoies may 
not have been comic masterpieces, but at least they were consistently 
funny, which is more than can be said for HIGH SCHOOL HIGH, the latest 
product to come off of David Zucker's script-by-numbers comedy assembly 
line.  This film bears more of a resemblance to such duds as DON'T BE A 
MENACE TO SOUTH CENTRAL WHILE DRINKING YOUR JUICE IN THE HOOD and LOADED 
WEAPON ONE than it does to any inventive parody.  Put simply, HIGH 
SCHOOL HIGH isn't just bad, it's very bad.  What else can I say about a 
movie that drags on for 85 minutes without delivering a single solid 
laugh?</P>
<P>     The first problem is the casting of Jon Lovitz as Richard Clark, 
the so-called hero -- a high school teacher who views the world through 
rose-colored glasses.  As part of a comedy ensemble, Lovitz can be quite 
funny, but it's apparent here that he is incapable of carrying a film on 
his own.  His whiny antics quickly grow tiresome, and it doesn't take 
long before we start to dislike his character.  He's not exactly 
supported by a strong comic cast, either.  The best performers are 
typically those in small supporting roles (like Natasha Gregson Wagner, 
the daughter of Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner, as a pregnant student), 
and even they're not that impressive.  Tia Carrere (TRUE LIES), who 
plays Clark's love interest, is virtually invisible (or at least as 
invisible as she can be), and Louise Fletcher (ONE FLEW OVER THE CUKOO'S 
NEST), as an iron-fisted principal, acts like she's trying out for the 
headmistress' role in MATILDA.  I won't attempt to explain the presence 
of distinguished Shakespearean actor John Neville (THE ADVENTURES OF 
BARON MUNCHAUSEN), except to say that a paycheck is a paycheck.</P>
<P>     HIGH SCHOOL HIGH attempts to lampoon movies like THE BLACKBOARD 
JUNGLE, LEAN ON ME, and DANGEROUS MINDS, but the only thing it succeeds 
in doing is illustrating the satirical bankruptcy of the production 
team.  Without exception, the jokes are way too obvious.  If you play 
the "guess the punch line" game, you'll rarely be wrong.  Of course, 
predictability isn't the lone problem, because the spontaneous comedy 
doesn't work, either.  The sight gags simply aren't funny, or even 
clever, and the verbal barbs are disappointingly tame.  At least Glen 
Campbell fans have a reason to rejoice -- this is the first time I've 
heard "Rhinestone Cowboy" played since its heyday at the top of the 
charts.</P>
<P>     Had the movie been amusing, it would have been easy to forgive the 
throwaway plot, but, since the humor is so feeble, the lack of a 
credible storyline becomes a huge disadvantage.  (Ironically, in the 
production notes, the film makers state that they're proud of the film's 
depth.  Regarding HIGH SCHOOL HIGH, that statement has to be the biggest 
joke of all.)  Clark, an academic-minded individual who cares about 
educating his students, is the new teacher at Marion Barry High, a 
hellish school in the midst of an urban war zone.  After a few rough 
days that find him getting chained to his desk and participating in a 
"Chickee Run" (see REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE), he gains the respect of the 
class tough guy (Mekhi Phifer), and everyone else soon falls in line.  
Once Clark has his students' attention, it's up to him to find 
innovative teaching methods to keep them interested.  Along the way, he 
has time for a romance with the principal's secretary (oops, sorry... 
administrative assistant) while simultaneously foiling a big time drug 
deal.  </P>
<P>     Actually, all things considered, this year's THE SUBSTITUTE (one of 
the films supposedly spoofed here), which was mostly intended to be 
serious, contains more laugh-generating material than HIGH SCHOOL HIGH.  
This brand of mindless comedy has passed the point where it offers more 
than minimal entertainment.  Even graded on a liberal curve, there's no 
way HIGH SCHOOL HIGH can score better than an "F".</P>
