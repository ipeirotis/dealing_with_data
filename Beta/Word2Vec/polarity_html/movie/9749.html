<PRE>A LIFE LESS ORDINARY
(R)</PRE>
<PRE>A review by E. Benjamin Kelsey</PRE>
<PRE>* * * (out of four)</PRE>
<P>Sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest. Some
people call it "original" or "artsy" or "abstract". Some people simply call
it "trash". A LIFE LESS ORDINARY is sure to bring about mixed feelings.</P>
<P>Definitely a Generation-X aimed movie, A LIFE LESS ORDINARY has everything
from claymation to profane angels to a Karaoke-based musical dream sequence.
WHEW! Anyone in their 30's or above is probably not going to grasp what can
be enjoyed about this film. It's somewhat silly, it's somewhat outrageous,
and it's definitely not your typical romance story, but for the right
audience, it works.</P>
<P>A lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to
us from the same team that brought us TRAINSPOTTING. Well sorry folks, but I
haven't seen TRAINSPOTTING so I can't really compare. Whether that works in
this film's favor or not is beyond me. But I do know this: Ewan McGregor,
whom I had never had the pleasure of watching, definitely charmed me. He was
great! Cameron Diaz's character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp. The
audience may find it difficult to care about her, thus discouraging the hopes
of seeing her unite with McGregor after we are immediately sucked into caring
about and identifying with him. Misguided? You bet. Loveable? You bet.</P>
<P>A LIFE LESS ORDINARY was a delight and even had a bonus for me when I
realized it was filmed in my hometown of Salt Lake City, Utah. This was just
one more thing I didn't know about this movie when I sat down with a five
dollar order of nachos and a three dollar Coke. Maybe not knowing the premise
behind this film made for a pleasant surprise, but I think even if I had
known, I would have been just as happy. A LIFE LESS ORDINARY is quirky,
eccentric, and downright charming! Not for everyone, but a definite change of
pace for your typical night at the movies.</P>
