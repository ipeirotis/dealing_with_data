<P>     For the most part, Dennis Hopper is known as a psycho villain of=20
the first order.  Consider this resume:  the off-the-wall sleazeball in=20
BLUE VELVET, the mad bomber in SPEED, and the nutcase gang leader in=20
WATERWORLD.  It seems that when you want a really over-the-top bad guy,=20
Hopper's the one to get.  So it comes as something of a surprise to find=20
him playing completely against type in CARRIED AWAY.  Here, he's Joseph=20
Svenden, a shy, insecure school teacher who probably couldn't kill=20
anyone if pushed into it.  Most amazing is that Hopper not only succeeds=20
in the role, but thrives.  Giving his best performance since 1991's=20
PARIS TROUT, Hopper immerses himself in Joseph so completely that the=20
actor's own personality, along with his considerable baggage, becomes=20
submerged. =20</P>
<P>     It's difficult to say what CARRIED AWAY is primarily about, because=20
it deals with so many issues:  how we view sexuality, how love compares=20
to lust, and how everyone -- men and women -- have a tendency to become=20
stale and complacent with the approach of late middle age.  Joseph knows=20
about this latter issue first-hand.  At age 47, he's dissatisfied with=20
his life, but doesn't know what to do about it.  He's engaged to a=20
woman, Rosealee Henson (Amy Irving), whom he has loved since high=20
school, but something lifeless in their relationship keeps him from=20
actually tying the knot.  He hasn't found anything that he's truly good=20
at -- he's a mediocre teacher and a worse farmer.  He lives with his=20
dying mother (Julie Harris) in the house where he has spent his entire=20
life.  Joseph is trapped, both in an infirm body (a childhood accident=20
caused serious damage to one foot), and in his village. =20</P>
<P>     Relief -- or at least a modicum of excitement -- arrives in the=20
person of Catherine Wheeler (Amy Locane), a sexually precocious 17-year=20
old with a killer body.  Her parents move into one of Joseph's=20
neighboring houses, and she becomes his student at the small two-
classroom school where he teaches.  In her own way, Catherine feels as=20
trapped as Joseph.  Her mother is a drunk and her father is more=20
interested in shooting pheasants than caring for her.  So, looking for=20
an escape, she discovers her teacher, whom she clumsily seduces.  An=20
expert touch isn't needed, however.  Joseph is quite willing, and,=20
though he feels guilty at first, he gradually comes to view his=20
relationship with Catherine as a liberating experience=85 until she begins=
=20
to fantasize about marrying him.</P>
<P>     At its heart, CARRIED AWAY is a love story.  It's about Joseph and=20
Rosealee, and how Catherine's presence in their lives invigorates their=20
relationship.  Through his affair with Catherine, Joseph discovers what=20
it means to be alive.  He wakes up.  In his own words, he is "carried=20
away", and, in a poignant, touching scene with Rosealee, he shows her=20
the joys of letting go.  "I want us to change," he says, "before we get=20
too old and die."</P>
<P>     In addition to Hopper's fine job, the principal supporting players=20
are solid.  Amy Irving (CROSSING DELANCEY) bears all (literally and=20
figuratively) in a performance of surprising emotional depth.  Rosealee=20
is a sad figure who, like Joseph, wants something that she doesn't=20
understand and can't put into words.  As Catherine, Amy Locane (BLUE=20
SKY) exudes not only sexuality, but vulnerability.  Despite frequently=20
appearing as the vixen temptress (like when she's imitating Lady=20
Godiva), Locane offers us glimpses of the hurt, confused child carefully=20
concealed beneath the brazen exterior.  Gary Busey, as Catherine's=20
father, is uncharacteristically restrained, and Hal Holbrook provides=20
most of the comic relief as a small town doctor.</P>
<P>     One of the things I found most refreshing about CARRIED AWAY is how=20
little melodrama there is for such a potentially-controversial issue. =20
When Joseph's relationship with Catherine comes into the open, as it=20
surely must, we're not treated to histrionic displays by distraught=20
parents and neighbors.  In fact, director Bruno Barreto has a little fun=20
with the audience concerning the reaction of Catherine's father.  But,=20
ultimately, the one who has the most difficulty coping with the thought=20
of a 47-year old man sleeping with a 17-year old student is Joseph=20
himself. =20</P>
<P>     Although Catherine is developed as a real character with real=20
problems, CARRIED AWAY isn't as much about her as it is about Joseph's=20
reaction to her.  This is, after all, his story.  Although these two=20
profess to love one another, they are both lying, perhaps as much to=20
themselves as to each other.  Their reasons for having sex are far more=20
complex than simple "love", and Barreto's film has the courage to=20
examine those reasons.  CARRIED AWAY is erotic, but it's also thoughtful=20
and intelligent, and, coupled with Hopper's extraordinary performance,=20
that's reason enough to be carried away by this motion picture.</P>
