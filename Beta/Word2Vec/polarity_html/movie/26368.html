<P>An energetic, visually stunning, but intellectually hollow recreation
of the mysterious life of Jeanne D'Arc.</P>
<P>In history Jeanne D'Arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and
controversy, which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and
creative directors, who can basically alter the story as they
wish. She came in a time where people desperately needed a saint. A
hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and
happiness. Director/writer Luc Besson ('Nikita', 'Leon') portrays his
version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of France and was
burned at the stake for witchcraft. Besson tries to recreate the
person behind the legend. He tries not to show her as a saint or a
villain. He shows her as a human being. In a time where blood was
almost pouring from the sky, and the air smelled of rotten flesh, it
is hard to keep your sanity. The only support and hope is in God. At
the age of 13, Jeanne (Milla Jovovich ) watches her own sister
murdered and raped by the English soldiers. This terrible event makes
a lasting impact on Jeanne's mind. God is no longer her support. He
has become her obsession. She starts seeing visions and signs that
command her to raise an army and free France from the siege of the
English tyranny. With the help of the wise Yolande D'Aragon (Faye
Dunaway ) and Charles VII (John Malcovich), whose grand royal
ambitions and life are at stake, Jeanne raises an army and marches
towards the English walls. After this the film stays mostly on the
battlefield, where Besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing
action sequences, only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo. The
movie is filled with dreamy, symbolic images of pure artistic
craftsmanship, that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac
atmosphere. The film is lost in time and space, hysterically jumping
back and forth in Jeanne's thoughts, imagination and
conscience. Besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the
medieval age, feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping
in your body in the heat of battle.</P>
<P>But the film is far from being flawless. The script needs a lot of
polishing. Except for Jeanne, there are no real characters. And
although a grand star cast is assembled, their characters are nothing
more than props, not more alive than the costumes that they are
wearing. As for the Maiden of Lorraine herself, she is portrayed as a
simple girl, too small for her divine task. In the latter part of the
film, we see her as hysterical, confused and on the brink of madness,
with her past purity and innocence for ever lost. Jovovich handles the
part with more panache than one might expect. But though her screen
time is incredible excessive, both Malcovich ('Being John Malcovich')
and Dunaway ('Titus') surpass her rather overacted and simply
unprofessional performance. And even Hoffman manages to breathe some
life into his dreadfully small part. Besides casting Jovovich,
Besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the
end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting. There are some viscously
evil Englishmen that murder, pillage and betray with a smile on their
faces. And some incredibly brave and noble Frenchmen, represented by
the "three musketeers" of this story -- the brave Gilles de Rais
(Vincent Cassel), the wise Aulon (Desmond Harrington) and the strong
La Hire (Richard Ridings). Though all those actor perform well, their
characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the
glory of France. And thus, there is no sense of realism in this
film. 'The Messenger' has muscles instead of brains. There is some
relief in the end, where Besson lays down his armor and starts
thinking. Dustin Hoffman's appearance helps and the film ends
elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of
praise. Jeanne's character is unlocked, but whether God was in the
picture or not, is never quite explained. Was she a confused peasant
girl driven by her own hunger for revenge? Or was she truly a
messenger of God? The film poses as many questions as answers and
nothing is completely obvious. Bess o Messenger' is nothing more than
a fairly good film. It is not much that you remember of it after you
leave the theater. Maybe the sound, the dreamy sequences, but
certainly not the dialogue. It is an elegant and adrenaline pumping
history lesson for the MTV-generation, that although presents some
interesting material, works better when it's on the battlefield.</P>
