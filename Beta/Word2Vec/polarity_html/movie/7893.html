<PRE>                                VOLCANO
                       A film review by Ted Prigge
                        Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Mick Jackson
Writers: Jerome Armstrong and Billy Ray
Starring: Tommy Lee Jones, Anne Heche, Don Cheadle, Gaby Hoffman, Keith 
David</P>
<P>There's a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads 
the book "Screenwriting Made Easy."  This is funny the first time just 
'cause it is, but funnier as the film goes on since it's totally ironic 
since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it, outlined it 
and then wrote this film.  It's like they took the sub-genre of the 
disaster pic, which can be fun and hokey at the same time, and then 
forgot one of the greatest parts of them: the stupid, eccentric 
characters.  Yes, "The Poseidon Adventure" is crap, but it's fun 'cause 
of all the stupid, eccentric characters.  And "Earthquake," MY GOD!  
"Earthquake" has got to be one of the worst movies of all time, but at 
least they had the joke of having Charlton Heston sleeping with 
Genevieve Bujold.</P>
<P>"Volcano" takes a semi-intriguing yet stupendously inane plot (a volcano 
NO ONE knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning and then erupts 
again later then stops...only it's in, dare I say it? L.A!!!) and then 
puts no stupid, stereotypical, eccentric characters in it.  They're just 
stupid.  And the actors are all good ones.  Tommy Lee Jones is great, an 
Oscar winner, and a member of the Men In Black (my vote for what should 
be the coolest movie of the summer).  Anne Heche is a good indy actress. 
 Don Cheadle STOLE the disappointing "Devil in a Blue Dress" from 
Denzel's feet.  And Gaby's one of the few good teenage actors.  But they 
get nothing to do but act dumb and scream at what's going on.  They do 
their best, God bless them, but they're all lost in the fake magma (only 
Don Cheadle gets an interesting part and he's the greatest part of the 
film).</P>
<P>There's no real suspense here 'cause you don't care about anyone.  I 
actually was rooting for Gaby's character to get killed so Tommy Lee 
Jones wouldn't have to keep saving her (he did it like thirty times!).  
And there are no interesting sites in L.A. that we see get destroyed.  
Part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or 
destroyed or whatever.  In "Independence Day," the best part (other than 
Judd Hirsch) was watching the White House and Empire State Building get 
blown up by the aliens.  That was cool.  Watching really fake-looking 
magma plow down the street is not.</P>
<P>Okay, so the film's not devoid of merit.  As I already stated, Don 
Cheadle was great and the cast does their best.  And there's this really 
moronic scene which looks cool.  John Carrol Lynch (Norm from "Fargo") 
goes on a subway car to save people but the lava comes and surrounds it. 
 He has one guy who's wounded and COULD make it.  He could throw the guy 
and jump and still survive.  But NO!!!  He has to go and inanely jump 
and land right in the middle of the lava.  Here's the cool sight: he 
melts.  Here's the dumb part of it: he somehow manages to throw the man 
to safety as his legs are melting.  Cool sight.  No logic.  But cool 
sight.</P>
<P>The volcano erupts twice and for some reason, the film ends there.  They 
aren't worried about it eruting again, they just go home to their 
toppled homes.  But to tell the truth, I was glad they didn't go on.  I 
was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended.  My god, it 
was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film.  I 
haven't seen "Dante's Peak" but I've heard it's a masterpiece compared 
to this.</P>
<P>If you want to see a cool disaster flick that's inane but interesting, 
rent "The Towering Inferno" with Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, and the 
schweppervescent O.J. Simpson (he saves a cat).  If you want to waste 
your time watching a boring, stupid disaster flick (literally, it almost 
grossed half of its budget), see this.  But I warned you.</P>
