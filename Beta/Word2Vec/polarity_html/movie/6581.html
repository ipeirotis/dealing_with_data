<P>     THE EVENING STAR has so much good will working for it from the start
that it would have taken an effort to make it a complete catastrophe.
TERMS OF ENDEARMENT was a popular and critical success, and Aurora
Greenway gave Shirley MacLaine a character which re-defined her career.
Screenwriter and director Robert Harling is well-aware of this history,
and his opening credits sequence tries to make the most of it.  Over
pictures of MacLaine, Debra Winger and Jeff Daniels, Michael Gore's
familiar TERMS OF ENDEARMENT theme plays, working that good will like a
boxer works the body to soften up the opponent.  The unintended effect of
these familiar signifiers, however, is to remind you how much more focused
and satisfying a film TERMS was than THE EVENING STAR.</P>
<P>     The sequel (based on Larry McMurtry's sequel to his own original
novel) finds Aurora Greenway fifteen years older and little-changed.  The
same nearly-oppressive love which complicated Aurora's relationship with
her late daughter Emma has similarly complicated her relationships with
the three grandchildren she raised, all of whom are leading less than
perfect lives.  Tommy (George Newbern) is in jail for drug possession;
Teddy (Mackenzie Astin) is an unmarried father driving a tow truck;
Melanie (Juliette Lewis) is determined to run off to Los Angeles with her
aspiring model boyfriend (Scott Wolf).  An unhappy Aurora seeks help in
therapy, where she finds her young counselor Jerry Bruckner (Bill Paxton)
as helpful personally as professionally.  Through various trials and
tragedies, Aurora tries to make sense of her life by organizing photos and
mementos into a scrapbook which -- she hopes -- will explain her place in
the world.</P>
<P>     The key to the success of TERMS OF ENDEARMENT lay in its
pitch-perfect study of a contentious mother-daughter relationship, yet it
is not exactly because Emma is absent that THE EVENING STAR feels less
potent.  That one relationship focused TERMS, however; you knew exactly
what it was really about.  THE EVENING STAR is in desperate need of that
kind of focus.  In addition to Aurora's relationships with each of her
three grandchildren and with her counselor/suitor, the film examines
Aurora's friendship with her long-time maid Rosie (Marion Ross), Rosie's
romance with next-door neighbor Arthur (the late Ben Johnson in his last
role), Aurora's rivalry with wealthy divorcee Patsy Carpenter (Miranda
Richardson), Melanie's relationship with her boyfriend, and Aurora's
strange relationship with a former flame (Donald Moffatt).  Harling throws
a lot of stuff at the screen, and some of it sticks, notably some
exceptional moments for Ross and a few catty exchanges between MacLaine
and Richardson.  Unfortunately, there isn't enough of the stuff that
works, and plenty of down time as Harling searches for a narrative
deserving of Aurora's fire.</P>
<P>     Shirley MacLaine obviously has a blast returning to the role of
Aurora, and that obvious joy is likely to bring an audience with her
farther than the material itself deserves.  Aurora preens deliciously
after she spends the night with Jerry, smiles a venomous smile as she
catches Patsy in a deception, and generally makes overbearing motherhood
her own personal fiefdom; it's just plain fun to spend time with a
character this colorful.  If only MacLaine hadn't made so many of Aurora's
quirks so familiar by taking on a succession of infuriating-but-lovable
roles distinguishable from one another only by the film in which they
appeared -- STEEL MAGNOLIAS, POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE, GUARDING TESS, MRS.
WINTERBOURNE.  All found MacLaine doing riffs on Aurora with varying
degrees of success, and even a lively performance feels recycled after so
many precursors.  It doesn't feel at all like we have missed over a
decade of Aurora Greenway's life.  We've just been watching her using
aliases.</P>
<P>     The only time THE EVENING STAR hits a pure high note is when Jack
Nicholson makes an all-too-brief cameo as playboy astronaut-turned-family
man Garrett Breedlove (the role for which he won a Best Supporting Actor
Academy Award).  It is one of Nicholson's best and most restrained pieces
of film acting in years; he seems both genuinely pleased to see his old
love, and genuinely unsure about how to interact with her.  There is so
much affection and charm in those few scenes, as all the soap opera plot
developments and histrionics take a breather, that it almost feels like
1983 all over again.  Of course, that is what Robert Harling was going for
all along in THE EVENING STAR, but he only had a couple of pieces of the
puzzle available to him.  A Paul McCartney concert with a token appearance
by Ringo does not a Beatles reunion make, and THE EVENING STAR strives for
a similar appeal it can't hope to achieve.</P>
