<P>     If MEET THE FEEBLES wasn't your cup of tea, NIGHT OF THE LIVING 
DEAD grossed you out, and you didn't see the humor in THE EVIL DEAD, 
then CEMETERY MAN is definitely not for you.  On the other hand, if you 
don't mind horrific, grotesque comedy that mixes the gore of George 
Romero and Dario Argento with         the quixotic irreverence of Monty Python 
and DELICATESSEN, CEMETERY MAN provides the opportunity for a funny, 
strange time at the movies.  This Italian picture, directed by Michele 
Soavi, is an all-English effort with plenty of violence (wall-to-wall 
blood-and-gore), sex (occasionally with dead bodies), and general 
weirdness.  By the end of the one-hundred minute feature, you'll either 
be totally revolted or smirking at the inventiveness and audacity of the 
whole thing. CEMETERY MAN recalls Bob Balaban's 1993 feature, MY 
BOYFRIEND'S BACK, but with a much nastier edge.</P>
<P>     British actor Rupert Everett (the Prince of Wales in THE MADNESS OF 
KING GEORGE) has the title role of Francesco Dellamorte (literally 
Francesco of Death), the "Cemetery Man."  In Francesco's town of 
Buffalora, the dead don't stay dead.  Seven days after burial, they come 
back, clawing their way out of their graves, looking for flesh to eat.  
Francesco has been employed by the local mayor (Stefano Masciarelli) to 
live in the cemetery and dispatch the zombies before they escape into 
the community.  The only way to eliminate a ghoulish "returnee" is to 
destroy its skull.  Francesco's favorite weapon is a pistol, but he's 
not above using any other handy object.  The matter-of-fact manner in 
which he eliminates the zombies provides a source of constant humor.</P>
<P>     CEMETERY MAN is loosely divided into three episodes.  The first 
involves Francesco's love affair with a beautiful widow (Anna Falchi) 
who visits the grave of her husband every day.  The second is about the 
affection for a bodiless head exhibited by Francesco's sidekick, a mute 
named Gnaghi (Francois Hadji-Lazaro).  In the third, an unbalanced 
Francesco starts killing living people, then becomes enraged when 
someone else takes credit for his murders.</P>
<P>     Some of the comedy is inspired -- in a deranged way, of course.  
Those who only enjoy films like SENSE AND SENSIBILITY aren't likely to 
venture near a venue showing CEMETERY MAN.  For this movie to come 
across as something more than an exercise in gratuitous gore, it's 
necessary to embrace CEMETERY MAN's bizarre subject matter.  There are 
plenty of laughs for those who view the film in the intended spirit.  
Plus, there's a fair amount of artistry lurking just beneath the surface 
-- Soavi's love for the horror genre shows in the composition of almost 
every scene (although he uses the camera-on-a-lazy-Susan rotation effect 
a few times too many).</P>
<P>     Despite its boldness, CEMETERY MAN falls considerably short of 
being a masterpiece.  The film runs out of comic momentum about two-
thirds of the way through, and has to lurch and stumble towards the 
finish line.  Soavi can only sustain the humor for so long before it 
starts becoming repetitive.  CEMETERY MAN never really ends -- it just 
stops, and the scenes leading up to the closing credits are easily the 
movie's weakest.  If you left the film twenty minutes early, you 
wouldn't miss much.</P>
<P>     So, do I recommend CEMETERY MAN?  Only to a select few.  This is 
definitely not a mainstream motion picture, and its capacity to offend 
may startle unprepared movie-goers. Personally, I have nothing against a 
film that plays such intentionally extreme, over-the-top horror for 
laughs.  CEMETERY MAN could have been better, but it more easily could 
have been a lot worse.  The best thing I can say abut Michele Soavi's 
film is that it elicited more laughter from me than about 90% of 
Hollywood's bland comedies.  And it's refreshing to see, if only for one 
film, a stylish tastelessness that swims against the prevailing tide of 
political correctness.</P>
