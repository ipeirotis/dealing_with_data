<PRE>THE PEACEMAKER (1997)
A Film Review by Ted Prigge
Copyright 1997 Ted Prigge</PRE>
<P>Director: Mimi Leder
Writer: Michael Schiffer
Starring: George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Michael Iures, Armin
Mueller-Stahl, Michael Boatman</P>
<P>Big budget action pics are usually just passed off as "crap," and I
agree that most of them are.  I mean, I don't know about you but I
cringe everytime someone like Seagal or Van Damme puts one out on the
market precisely in that time when there's nothing else good so it will
make it look like the movie-of-the-weekend by comparison.  But in this
surprisingly interesting fall movie season, when there are good films
like "The Game" and "L.A. Confidential" out, as well as a bear movie
written by David Mamet, the obligatory monthly action pic ("The
Peacemaker") actually delivers.  Yes, it's full of cliches, devoid of
characterization or emotion, filled with scenes that have been stolen
from other actions pics that were stolen from other action pics.  And
yes, it ends with the big cliche of the ticking timebomb (yawn).  But
fuck it, it's fun.</P>
<P>"The Peacemaker" combines the usual action pic with touches of Bond and
Clancy to produce a story about two government peoples' search for
stolen nuclear weapons that were missing when a train carrying them
crashed in Russia, setting one of them off (cool scene, by the way).
Called to duty are: a government chick (no clue what her position is)
played by Nicole Kidman (with brown hair and one of her attempts at an
American accent); and a military colonel or something played by George
Clooney.  The sight of these two on screen for the first time of course
makes us realize how important the marketing was instead of the plot
because they look great together.</P>
<P>But as the story kind of twists and turns, we find out that the boys who
stole the nuclear weapons are being screwed over themselves by three
Bosnian brothers, the unofficial leader of them being a UN diplomat
(Michael Iures) who wants to take one of them to New York and ignite the
UN building in protest of their lack of support for the killings in
Bosnia.  Yeah.  Interesting idea, but we all know how serious this
should be treated.  But at leas they're up to date on current events.</P>
<P>Kidman and Clooney, boasting a kind of retro Hepburn/Tracy relationship,
starting out with her asking for a man who will follow her orders only
to be ordered around by the rule-breaking Clooney for the remainder of
the film, and ending with a potential bit of dating (glad they didn't
have them fool around in between action sequences or something).  The
two of them journey around the world throughout the film, travelling to
Vienna, Russia, etc - getting involved in surprisingly well-executed
action sequences.</P>
<P>Mimi Leder, who has directed "China Beach" and "ER" episodes, makes a
fun-filled first film.  She doesn't waste time, and the film moves
quickly, prohibiting the need to check your watch every couple seconds.
And her action sequences look excellent and contain a lot of humor.  The
screenplay by Michael Schiffer is nothing special, but it does provide a
lot of funny lines here and there.</P>
<P>And the acting is good too.  George Clooney has made four films in a
year and a half, and he has definitely proved that he's a commanding
presence in front of the Hollywood camera.  In fact, he seems to be so
comfortable nowadays that it almost seems that he's flirting with the
lense.  He has a great sense of humor with his acting, and looks cool as
hell during the action sequences.  He's certainly becoming an
accomplished Hollywood actor.  Don't know if that's a good thing or not,
but nevertheless, it's true.</P>
<P>Kidman gets the fuzzy end of the lollipop, but nevertheless does a good
job.  She shows a tough woman who seems to be striving very hard in some
scenes (so much that her shirt sticks to her body).  And there's those
lovely shots of her in the swimming pool, of course.  Anyway, Kidman's
better than this, but I suppose it's fun to do a crap role like this
every once in a while.</P>
<P>Also, Armin Mueller-Stahl acts in a big budget film for the second time
in one month (the other was "The Game"), and, as he was before, is kind
of wasted seeing that he's a very good actor.  Also look for "Spin
City"'s Michael Boatman in a little part that could have gone to any
actor.</P>
<P>Oh.  And Michael Iures as the lead terrorist is actually very good.  He
looks like a kind of Middle Eastern Jeremy Irons, and has this great
look on his face that shows that he truly has lived in Bosnia.  He looks
absolutely ragged, and I actually felt a bit of sympathy for the guy,
even if he wanted to blow up New York.</P>
<P>Dreamworks first film is not a great film, but it delivers what I
thought it would: present a good, dumb, action pic that's fun to watch.
And it is.  It's got cliche after cliche, lacks any depth, and has more
plot holes than a Seagal flick (okay, maybe I'm exaggerating here).  But
who cares - it was fun, and I'm gonna go ahead and give it a
non-pretentious thumb up.</P>
