<P>     I'm guessing -- and from the available evidence, it's not a great
guess -- that BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN began life as an insider satire of
Hollywood excess, stupidity, ego and power-mongering.  If so, the film
that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic
unintentional jokes in film history.  It has already been well-documented
that the original title, AN ALAN SMITHEE FILM, became a problem when
miserable test screenings forced re-cuts against the will of director
Arthur Hiller, prompting Hiller himself to opt for the Directors'
Guild-mandated pseudonym of Alan Smithee.  That left a film satire in the
hands of writer Joe Eszterhas, as humorless a hack as ever put finger to
word processor.  And you could just smell the disaster brewing.</P>
<P>     If you're unfortunate enough to sit through BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN,
you'll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up.
Ostensibly, it's a pseudo-documentary account of a director named Alan
Smithee (Eric Idle) who loses control of a big-budget action film called
TRIO starring Sylvester Stallone, Whoopi Goldberg and Jackie Chan (all of
whom appear as themselves).  When the only recourse available to him is
abandoning the project to be called "An Alan Smithee Film" -- which, of
course, it already is -- Smithee steals the negative of the film and
threatens to destroy it.  Among the parties interviewed are the film's
producer James Edmunds (Ryan O'Neal) and studio boss Jerry Glover (Richard
Jeni), who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while
painfully unfunny things go on around them.</P>
<P>     It's bad enough that BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN has -- literally -- not a
single laugh for its entire, blissfully brief 84 minutes.  What makes it
even worse is Eszterhas' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once,
but twice or even three times.  Michael Ovitz references, SHOWGIRLS
references, oral sex references, Whoopi Goldberg/Ted Danson references --
all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is Eszterhas'
stock-in-trade.  The reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive
with some frequency, notably with the hilarious use of the word "feminist"
as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film.
By the time Coolio and Chuck D show up as black independent film-makers
the Brothers Brothers (cleverly identified as "bad a--" and "badder a--",
among other unprintable things), you may be ready to walk out of the
theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified.</P>
<P>     Those documentary captions, for all their leaden obviousness, allow
the best insight into what's so hideously wrong with BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN.
Not content to stick any Hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier
wit, Eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new
character appears.  The producer is a "liar" who "slept in the White
House;" the media are "maggots" and "leeches" working for publications
like "The New York Slimes" and "Newsleak" (with the camera zooming in on
the altered title to make sure you don't miss the joke).  It doesn't even
matter that Eszterhas tags "penile implant" after his own name when he
makes a cameo, because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign
self-deprecation.  This is a petulant schoolboy's idea of satire --
pictures of Hollywood insiders to which Eszterhas has taken a pen to
draw little moustaches and black out the teeth.</P>
<P>     The last stomach-churning straw comes when BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN closes
with out-takes over the closing credits, the kind that show the audience
how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour 
and a half of your life away.  Perhaps it was just a final, desperate
attempt by Eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the
film, or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted
threatening to blow their whole career.  Pity everyone involved with this
excessive, ego-driven "satire" of excess and ego.  It's too bad that only
directors can remove their names from noxious material like this.
Otherwise, you might have seen credits for BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN overflowing
with Alan Smithees.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 slow BURNs:  0.</PRE>
