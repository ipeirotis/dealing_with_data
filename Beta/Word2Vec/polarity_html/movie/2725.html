<P>     This time around, I thought I'd do things a little differently.
For both THE FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF, I made my way through the
written version before approaching the cinematic one.  Neither book
dazzled me, and the impressions given by the movies were less
memorable.  So, for THE CLIENT, I decided to eschew Grisham's novel
altogether and see if, divorced from its source material, Joel
Schumacher's film could provide a couple hours of light entertainment.
Besides, a friend of mine was only able to get through a third of book,
and her opinion of Grisham is certainly higher than mine.</P>
<P>     It's not difficult to understand why THE FIRM, THE PELICAN BRIEF,
and THE CLIENT have all been bestsellers.  They're tightly-written,
don't require a lot of concentration, have very simple storylines, and
can be read in a sitting or two.  In essence, they're what someone I
know calls "good trash."  Grisham is prolific--and now, very wealthy.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, his writing makes for a perfect Hollywood
screenplay--lots of action and not much originality.  THE CLIENT's
greatest disadvantage is its flat plot, which includes few (if any)
surprises and revolves on a premise that we've seen before--in THE
FIRM and THE PELICAN BRIEF, among others.  Grisham apparently has a
thing about a group of law officers going after some innocent victim of
circumstances.</P>
<P>     THE CLIENT's premise is tenuous in its believability.  The movie
starts out with young Mark Sway (Brad Renfro) out in the woods,
watching a mob lawyer try to kill himself.  In attempting to foil the
suicide, Mark gets caught, and has to listen to a rambling confession
before the lawyer blows his brains out.  After that, hotshot prosecutor
Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) wants Mark on the witness stand,
thinking--correctly--that the boy learned the location of the missing
corpse of a dead senator.  Realizing that he's in over his head, Mark
seeks out an attorney, and finds one in the person of Reggie Love
(Susan Sarandon), who takes his case for a fee of one dollar.  But a
killer (Anthony LaPaglia) who believes Mark knows too much, is after
the boy and anyone to whom he might tell his secret.</P>
<P>     In the beginning, Mark won't reveal anything about his
conversation with the dead mob lawyer.  Why?  Later, after his life has
been threatened, the reason is obvious, but why hide things at the
start?  I guess we're supposed to believe that the kid is scared and
confused, but he does enough clear-headed things to limit the
plausibility of this explanation.</P>
<P>     Despite plot holes and contrivances, THE CLIENT is a well-made
motion picture.  Everything about it (except the screenplay) is
top-notch.  Director Joel Schumacher (whose last film was FALLING DOWN)
has spun a web of intrigue by getting the most out of his cast and
crew.  With expert jobs done by the editor and cinematographer, THE
CLIENT moves while having its share of dark, brooding moments as well
as tautly suspenseful ones.</P>
<P>     The cast is impeccable.  Newcomer Brad Renfro portrays Mark with a
palpable mix of anger and fear.  Susan Sarandon gives her usual solid
performance, and Tommy Lee Jones oozes equal parts charisma and false
charm.  Mary-Louise Parker, one of the better representatives of
today's crop of twentysomething actors, is underused as Mark's mother
Dianne, but she makes the most of every scene she's in.</P>
<P>     THE CLIENT is an example of what happens when a production team
does the best they can possibly do with a routine script.  Schumacher
has succeeded where two other accomplished directors (Sydney Pollack,
who did THE FIRM, and Alan Pakula, of THE PELICAN BRIEF) have failed:
bringing a Grisham novel to the screen in a manner that's more
entertaining than trying.  This isn't a masterpiece of suspense, but it
has its moments and is capable of providing some light summer
entertainment.</P>
<P>     I think from now on, I'll skip reading Grisham's books and wait
for the movies.  If nothing else, it will save me some time.</P>
