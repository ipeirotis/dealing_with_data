<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   During the three years since the release of the groundbreaking
   success PULP FICTION, the cinematic output from its creator, Quentin
   Tarantino, has been surprisingly low.  Oh, he's been busy -- doing
   the talk show circuit, taking small roles in various films,
   overseeing the production of his screenplay FROM DUSK TILL DAWN,
   making cameo appearances on television shows, providing a vignette
   for the ill-fated anthology FOUR ROOMS -- everything, it seems,
   except direct another feature-length film.  It's been the long
   intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which PULP
   FICTION reached which has made Mr. Tarantino's new feature film,
   JACKIE BROWN, one of the most anticipated films of the year, and his
   third feature film cements his reputation as the single most
   important new American filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s.</P>
<P>   Things aren't going well for Jackie Brown (Pam Grier).  She's 44
   years old, stuck at a dead-end job ("$16,000 a year, plus retirement
   benefits that aren't worth a damn") as a flight attendant for the
   worst airline in North America -- and she's just been caught at the
   airport by ATF agent Ray Nicolette (portrayed with terrific childlike
   enthusiasm by Michael Keaton) and police officer Mark Dargus (Michael
   Bowen) smuggling $50 000 from Mexico for gun-runner Ordell Robbie
   (Samuel L. Jackson), who has her bailed out by unassuming bail
   bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster).  The loquacious Ordell, based
   out of a Hermosa Beach house where his horny, bong-hitting surfer
   girl Melanie (Bridget Fonda) and agreeable crony Louis Gara (Robert
   De Niro) hang out, operates under the policy that the best rat is a
   dead rat, and he's soon out to silence Jackie Brown.  Meanwhile, the
   authorities' target is Ordell, and they want Jackie to help them by
   arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars.  Only
   through a series of clever twists, turns, and double-crosses will
   Jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses.</P>
<P>   Although JACKIE BROWN marks Mr. Tarantino's first produced screenplay
   adaptation (based on the Elmore Leonard novel "Rum Punch"), there's
   no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film.  While
   he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense, the
   setting has been relocated to Los Angeles and the lead character's
   now black.  In terms of ambiance, the film harkens back to the 1970s,
   from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to
   the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit
   sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions.  The opening
   sequence featuring Ms. Grier wordlessly striding through the LAX,
   funky music blaring away on the speakers, is emblematic of films of
   that era.  The timeframe for the film is in fact 1995, but the
   atmosphere of JACKIE BROWN is decidedly retro.</P>
<P>   Of course, nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of
   Pam Grier and Robert Forster as the two leads, and although the caper
   intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists, backstabbing, and
   deceptions deliciously unfold, the strength of JACKIE BROWN is the
   quiet, understated relationship developed between Jackie and Max;
   when they kiss, it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year.</P>
<P>   Tenderness?  In a Quentin Tarantino film?  Sure, there've been
   moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges
   between the Bruce Willis and Maria de Madeiros characters in PULP
   FICTION and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of Tim
   Roth and Amanda Plummer, or even in RESERVOIR DOGS, where a deep,
   unspoken bond develops between the Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth
   characters -- but for the most part, Mr. Tarantino's films are
   typified by manic energy, unexpected outbursts of violence, and
   clever, often wordy, banter.  These staples of his work are all
   present in JACKIE BROWN, but what's new here is a different facet of
   his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant
   emotional undercurrent, and a patience to draw out several scenes
   with great deliberation.  This effective demonstration of range
   prohibits the pigeonholing of Mr. Tarantino as simply a helmer of
   slick, hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes, and heralds him
   as a bonafide multifaceted talent; he's the real deal.</P>
<P>   This new aspect of Mr. Tarantino's storytelling is probably best
   embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary, sensitive,
   and exceedingly-professional Max Cherry, whose unspoken attraction to
   Jackie is touching.  Mr. Forster's nuanced, understated performance
   is the best in the film; he creates an amiable character of such
   poignancy that when he gazes at Jackie, we smile along with him.</P>
<P>   Much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era
   icon Pam Grier in the lead, with the wags buzzing that Mr. Tarantino
   may do for her what his PULP FICTION did to bolster John Travolta's
   then-sagging career.  As it turns out, Ms. Grier is solid in the
   film's title role, although nothing here forces her to test her
   range.  I do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks
   her career resurrection, though -- she's been working steadily over
   the years, often in direct-to-video action flicks, but also in such
   recent theatrical releases as Tim Burton's MARS ATTACKS! and Larry
   Cohen's ORIGINAL GANGSTAS (where she first teamed up with Mr.
   Forster.)  Of course, it's true that her role here was a Godsend -- a
   meaty a part as this is rarity for *any* actress, let alone one of
   her age and current status in the industry.</P>
<P>   While JACKIE BROWN may disappoint those looking for another PULP
   FICTION clone, it marks tremendous growth of Mr. Tarantino as a
   director whose horizons are rapidly expanding, and whose
   characterizations have never been better.  And while the film's
   narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes, it's
   filled with such sumptuous riches, ranging from the brashness of the
   vivid soundtrack to entertaining, inconsequential conversations
   between the characters, that there wasn't an unengaging moment.  With
   an impressive trio of feature films under his belt, it'll be
   interesting to see what he tries next.</P>

 Harvey Keitel' within seconds of the film's start.  I want to know what
 that kid's been seeing." - Charles Odell</P>
