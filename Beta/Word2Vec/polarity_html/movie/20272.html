<P>He idolized Fellini, who he wrote for and who gave him a chance to shoot
a film for the first time, but which was not accepted by Fellini as a
good enough work for him to use. The result was that Pasolini left
Fellini and made his directorial debut in a film which covered the seamy
side of life in Rome, Accattone (1961). It was different in style than
other films at the time and was received very well by the critics. He
concentrated on films during this period, as The Gospel According to St.
Matthew (1964) exemplifies the mystic character in the simple faces of
those involved with the preacher Christ, as he politically rails against
an unjust society that condones waste and corruption. His Christ even
curses those thieves of the people. For Pasolini's Christ, sin is only a
crime against daily servitude. Oedipus Rex (1967) was the film that was
closest to his upbringing, where the hero slays his father and sleeps
with his mother. That is destiny and it can't be changed, the myth,
which Pasolini believed, that so forcefully concurs with his own
beliefs. The film turned out to be visually satisfying to audiences,
though not pleasing all the critics. The last film he made, was his most
controversial and decadent, Salo (1975). Here he decides to tell the
truth as it is--not as he imagines it is. He relates the consumer
culture with its intent being to keep selling their product, comparing
it with Hitler's need to collect human bodies. Through all kinds of
sexual debasements and perversities that are shown in this poorly
received film, Pasolini attempted to make his point about current
Italian society being like fascism. That he should die so violent a
death, did not surprise everyone, especially since he led such a
non-conformist existence, one where violence always seemed to be a part
of his life, even though, he was not a violent person himself.</P>
<P>The 17-year-old, Pelosi, the accused murderer, was sentenced to 9-years
in jail as a youthful offender, and the Italian press had a field day
vilifying Pasolini for his moral decadence, almost saying that it was
his fault, his homosexuality caused the crime. Pasolini, the decadent
anti-fascist, pro-Communist, homosexual artist is a key figure in trying
to come to grips with modern Italy and its many passions, this
documentary provides some useful fodder about him, whether you are a
novice to him or have followed his career fully. Interestingly enough,
he was working on a book about some kind of modern Paul coming to
America to sell his religious beliefs, before his brutal murder.</P>
<P>One thing I can say for sure about Pasolini, is that he is always
interesting, even if he isn't always understood. This documentary gives
one a good quick-look at him and should encourage those who are so
inclined, to check-out his films or books, if they haven't done so
before.</P>
