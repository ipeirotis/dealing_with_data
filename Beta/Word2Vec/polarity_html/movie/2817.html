<P>     A companion piece in the truest sense of the term, THE GODFATHER
PART II earned as much adulation as its predecessor, if not more.
Garnering twelve Academy Award nominations, and again winning Best
Picture (and this time Best Director for Coppola as well), the second
installment has been rightfully hailed as the best sequel of all time.</P>
<P>     THE GODFATHER PART II is a more ambitious production than the
original since it attempts not only to tell a pair of completely
disconnected stories, but to do so in parallel.  The less time
consuming of the two presents the early life of Vito Corleone (played
by Robert DeNiro) in Sicily and New York, and shows how he came into
power.  The other tale picks up approximately a decade after the
conclusion of THE GODFATHER, and shows the means by which Michael
Corleone (Al Pacino), now secure in his position, attempts to expand
the family empire into Las Vegas and Cuba.</P>
<P>     Michael lives his life and runs his business by two of his
father's creeds: "A man who doesn't spend time with his family can
never be a real man" and "Keep your friends close, but your enemies
closer."  There are times, however, when those precepts fail as guiding
principles, such as when a betrayal occurs from within the family.
Broken trust arising from so intimate a source can be devastating.</P>
<P>     In THE GODFATHER, family was more important than anything to Don
Vito Corleone.  Michael has inherited his father's values and as PART
II opens, he is surrounded by the Corleone clan as they gather for his
son's first communion.  A symmetry between the first and second films
is established here--both open with a family assemblage, and each
quickly establishes where the power lies as the don "holds court."</P>
<P>     The Corleones no longer live in New York.  They have moved to
Nevada where they are amassing influence with the nebulous goal of some
day becoming "legitimate."  But the affairs of the East Coast are about
to interfere as Frankie Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) arrives to
request the don's acquiescence to a hit.  Michael cannot agree because
such a killing would ruin certain business dealings currently in
progress with the powerful and influential Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg).</P>
<P>     Plot and counterplot develop, and Michael becomes the focal point
of a web of betrayal and deceit, turned against by those he had sought
to protect.  Assassination attempts and government probes target
Michael, but he fights back using every scintilla of ingenuity he
possesses and sacrificing much of his humanity in the process.</P>
<P>     For a man constantly battling to keep his family together, a
mournful irony of THE GODFATHER PART II is that Michael's efforts
succeed only in fragmenting it.  If the end of the first film was
numbing, this one is shattering.  The flashback preceding the final
scene presents a stark differentiation of how things once were from
what they have become.</P>
<P>     A more comprehensive contrast emerges through the lengthy
sequences detailing Vito Corleone's rise from obscurity.  Showing his
arrival at Ellis Island, his early relationship with Clemenza (Bruno
Kirby), and his confrontation with Don Fanucci (Gastone Moschin), these
segments stand in contradiction to Michael's scenes.  Expansion is
replaced by slow disintegration, energy and success by pain and
failure.  If young Vito's era is the Corleone's dawn, Michael's is the
approaching twilight.</P>
<P>     The danger in interweaving the early twentieth century story with
the one from 1958 is that the momentum of either--or both--could be
curtailed.  While this occasionally happens (most notably in the first
shift back to 1917, shortly after the assassination attempt on
Michael), Coppola handles the transitions adroitly, keeping the pace
consistent enough to limit any sense of jarring or disorientation.</P>
<P>     The traditional elements of the Tragedy introduced in THE
GODFATHER reach their maturity in PART II.  Much of the humanity
remaining to Michael at the outset is leeched from him with each
deception and setback.  Late scenes with a resentful Fredo (John
Cazale) and a bitter Kay (Diane Keaton) emphasize the price for Michael
of continuing his father's dominion.  His flaw is his imperceptiveness
and, as is the case for any hero in a story of this nature, its effects
are crippling.</P>
<P>     Primarily due to the scope of events, PART II is not as
tightly-scripted as PART I.  While most of the first film takes place
in New York (with a few excursions elsewhere), here the settings vary:
Sicily, Ellis Island, New York, Nevada, Cuba, Miami, Washington DC ....
In letting their characters escape the confines of the "old
neighborhood", Coppola and Puzo lessen the intimacy of certain
interpersonal conflicts.</P>
<P>     Visually, many of Michael's scenes have a more gloomy appearance
this time around.  Especially during the latter portions of the film,
the don is shown in severely underexposed settings, appearing as a
silhouette.  His is a voice from the darkness--a photographic mirror
of what's happening beneath the surface.</P>
<P>     As the beginning of PART II echoes the opening of THE GODFATHER,
so too does the end.  Because of the manner in which circumstances are
handled and considering the people involved, the impact here is more
forceful.  The tragic flaw has accomplished its poisonous, inevitable
designs.  Coppola punctuates both movies with a gut-twisting
exclamation point.</P>
<P>     Combined, THE GODFATHER and THE GODFATHER PART II represent the
apex of American movie-making and the ultimate gangster story.  Few
sequels have expanded upon the original with the faithfulness and
detail of this one.  Beneath the surface veneer of an ethnic period
piece, THE GODFATHER is not so much about crime lords as it is about
prices paid in the currency of the soul for decisions made and
avoided.  It is that quality which establishes this saga as timeless.</P>
