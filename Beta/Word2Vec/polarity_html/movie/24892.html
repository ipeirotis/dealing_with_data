<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An American novelist, Maurice Bendrix (Van Johnson), stays on in London
after the war. A flashback takes us back to the days in the beginning of
World War 11 and the start of his great love affair he has with the wife
of a meek civil servant. This is the original film adaptation of the
Graham Greene semi-autobiography. It is noteworthy for Deborah Kerr's
exactingly curious performance as the dutiful wife, Sarah Miles, of the
dull civil servant whom she doesn't love but can't leave. Peter Cushing
as Henry Miles, is the dull civil servant running the daily wartime
operations of London, who can't live without his wife but who doesn't
have the passion she does about living. He has grown estranged from her,
content to live with this loveless marriage. And, for the whiny
performance of Van Johnson, who doesn't give a terrible performance as
the arrogant and jealous lover who hurts so easy, as much as he was
overshadowed by Deborah Kerr's stage presence.</P>
<P>The older B&W version puts less stress on the lust and more on the inner
conflict the two lovers are having. It's a more reserved telling of the
story, probably due to the conservative time it was filmed than anything
else. This version actually leaves a greater impact on the viewer of the
momentous tragedy of the self-imposed restrictions religion has placed
on the relationship for her. The story never seems illogical, as does
the tacky ending to the later version, which tried to get too fancy in
its approach to this melodramatic love story. There was no reason to
make a remake, and especially so, since the newer version doesn't add
anything new to the mix that the older version didn't already have.</P>
<P>At a cocktail party, Maurice chats with Henry about using him as example
of what a civil servant is like for the book he is working on about the
life of a civil servant. He is introduced to Sarah, as Henry insists
that he gets together with his wife, that she will be able to fill him
in on the details of his life better than he can.</P>
<P>The affair begins almost at once, as they are neighbors and have a
chance to spend a lot of time together, and it also helps that Henry is
always busy at the war office. Maurice is overwrought with jealousy that
Henry is still her husband, feeling insecure that he will lose her, as
he has fallen hopelessly in love. They have a spat when he is disturbed
by a rather harmless lie she tells, as the vicar's wife (Munro) comes
over and mistakes him for Henry, and she goes along with that mistake.
For him, it is disheartening to hear that the woman he loves can so
easily tell such a lie, as his imagination gets the best of him and he
imagines what if she is also lying to him about other things.</P>
<P>When Maurice asks her, "Why do you stay with him when I want to marry
you? She responds, "I want time...time for trust."</P>
<P>The pivotal event in the story, takes place in 1944, during an enemy
bombing raid, while she is visiting his house. He wants them to go down
to the basement shelter for safety, but she is afraid his landlady will
see them there. So he goes down to make sure she isn't there, just as
the building gets bombed, damaging mostly the basement. When she goes to
look for him in the basement rubble, she thinks that he is dead, as she
sees him lying there stiff with a heavy door over him. Five minutes go
by, before he comes upstairs and finds her kneeling down and praying,
and the first thing she says upon seeing him is, "You're not dead." She
then mysteriously breaks off their relationship, telling him that love
doesn't end just because we don't see each other. The breaking off of
the relationship leaves Maurice dispirited, thinking that she doesn't
love him anymore and it causes him to hate her for leaving him.</P>
<P>The story picks up now from the point the flashback left off, with the
war over and with him not seeing Sarah for over a year. Walking home in
the rain, he bumps into Henry, and even though he thought of avoiding
him, he seemed to be unconsciously propelled to meet him. Upon Henry's
insistence he comes over to his house again and hears Henry tell him he
suspects his wife is having an affair, and is even thinking of getting a
private detective to tail her. Maurice becomes jealous of the
possibility of a new lover, and asks Henry if he can go in behalf of him
to the detective agency, if he doesn't feel up to checking her out
himself. But Henry changes his mind about the agency, saying he was
wrong to think like that.</P>
<P>Maurice goes to the private detective agency without Henry's knowledge,
and sneakily spies on Sarah's life. The private investigator Parkis
(John Mills) tails her and shows Maurice a love letter she wrote that he
found in the waste basket of a Mr. Smythe (Goodliffe). With this info,
Maurice tells Henry about it, who reacts disgustedly with Maurice for
having her followed and refuses to respond to the news.</P>
<P>What evolves through Greene's telling of the inner spiritual battle
worked out through the characters, is that what is impossible becomes
what is religious and man's worldliness is seen as something that is not
completely satisfying to him but is something he thinks he needs to
satisfy because he doesn't believe in an afterlife.</P>
<P>When Maurice gets hold of Sarah's private journal, he learns why she
left him. Of how she made a pact with God, that if he were alive, she
would never see him again romantically and would return to her husband.
That she loves him so much, that to just have him live will be worth it.</P>
<P>She tells a Catholic priest, "I thought I prayed him alive and made that
stupid promise. The priest responds, "You made a vow to someone you
didn't believe in -- you have the free will to break it."But you have
also taken the first step toward God, that you could continue with, if
you so choose.</P>
<P>She will also get the atheist argument from a Mr. Smythe, who speaks at
Hyde Park, of how religion is just a bag of tricks, and she meets with
him in private as he tries to get her to go back to Maurice. He is a
very clever but embittered man, who was born with an ugly mole that
covers one whole side of his face, and asks himself if there is a loving
God, how could he create so much suffering!</P>
<P>Dmytryk has made an intelligent and cogent version of a tough novel to
film, and made it into an impressionable film. The best performances in
the film came from the two actors who seemed to be effortlessly acting,
John Mills, as the detective interested more in the craft of his job
than the ethics, though always aware of the moral implications of what
he is doing. His pleasurable performance stole the film. Peter Cushing
was just right for his role as someone who was both conniving and
sincere, as the depressed civil servant who can't find love even though
he has married someone he dearly loves. The simplicity of his beliefs,
that one does one's best, brings thunder down on the passionate lovers,
who try so hard to live up to what they believe in but have gone off in
opposite directions spiritually. In many respects, I found this the more
interesting version. It told a crisper story and avoided all the
unnecessary risks the other one took, and better understood Graham
Greene's dilemma he has with the modern world and his belief in a
demanding Catholicism that is not worried about pleasing anyone but God.
What the other version had, was more explicit sex scenes and a better
actor playing Bendrix.</P>
