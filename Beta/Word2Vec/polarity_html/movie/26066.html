HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  1/2</PRE>
<PRE>Where is parody when you need it?</PRE>
<P>HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME, as confusingly written by Joel Soisson, directed by 
Douglas Aarniokoski and edited by the committee of Chris Blunden, Rod 
Dean, Tracy Granger and Michael N. Knue, isn't merely a bad movie, it is 
a stupefyingly awful one.  Even though its story is ripe for lampooning, 
the movie takes itself quite seriously.</P>
<P>The fourth, and please last, in the HIGHLANDER series, it probably has a 
group of avid fans who understand it all.  I, however, not being a 
member of this cinematic cult found the plot to be an impenetrable mess.  
In a darkly-lit film, in which everyone wears the same dingy robes, it 
is hard to keep straight just who is who.  I'll try to tell you what I 
learned from the factoids that the movie threw at me, but I suspect this 
will be one of those reviews where HIGHLANDER groupies will discover 
errors aplenty.  (If you are a HIGHLANDER aficionado, please do not 
write me as this is not the sort of film that I care to waste my time 
discussing.) </P>
<P>This much I know.  There is a group of people called the "immortals."  A 
hardy bunch, they relish being slaughtered so that they can rise from 
the dead to fight again.  One of the few ways for an immortal to die is 
to chop off his or her head.  You'll be glad to know that Immortality is 
an equal opportunity employer, including both sexes and many races.</P>
<P>The immortals appear to have started back in sixteenth-century Scotland, 
around the time that the mother of Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) 
was burned at the stake.  After that, Connor and his kinsman, Duncan 
MacLeod (Adrian Paul), spend the rest of their infinite lives sword 
fighting their way through history.</P>
<P>When the movie, which switches timeframes frequently and delights in 
making them all look similar, is set in the present, the immortals' 
transportation of choice are noisy motorbikes.  They also love guns, all 
the better to spurt the blood.  </P>
<P>Some immortals are good and some are bad.  And sometimes they change 
sides -- I think.  There is also something about them getting a special 
charge when they actually manage to kill each other.  Personally, I 
would have gotten a really big charge if I could have killed them all.</P>
<P>Amid all the blood and the battles, the immortals pause briefly on 
occasion to share some bit of wisdom with us.  "Honor is not a weapon," 
Jin (Donnie Yen) tells us.  I have no idea what that means, but, since 
an immortal said it, you can be sure that it must be profound.</P>
<P>HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME runs 1:35.  It is rated R for violence and some 
strong sexuality and would be acceptable for older teenagers.</P>
