<PRE>                      THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Bill Murray is a wonderful comic who has trouble picking decent
scripts.  At his best, as in GROUNDHOG DAY, his delicious brand of wry
humor provides one delightful moment after another.  But without the
right material, as in LARGER THAN LIFE and many other recent pictures
of his, he tries to ham it up too much in order to make up for the
film's lack of natural humor.  In these latter movies, the result is
bad slapstick.</P>
<P>     THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE, which bears no relationship to THE
MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, provides the perfect vehicle for Murray's
talents.  Clearly enjoying his part, Murray takes this one-joke movie
and milks the joke for all it's worth.  Although the hilarious
GROUNDHOG DAY was a classic one-joke movie, comedies with a single idea
are the hardest to sustain.</P>
<P>     When the story starts, Wallace Ritchie (Murray) has just arrived
in London to visit his brother.  Blockbuster Video clerk Wallace with a
tartan hat and bad tourist clothes goes to visit his upscale brother
James.  Peter Gallagher plays James with all of the genuine horror of
someone who has an uninvited guest arrive at an inopportune moment.</P>
<P>     James is hosting a large dinner party of Germans to pitch them a
big deal.  Having his country-bumpkin brother on hand would be a
disaster, so James attempts to solve the problem by signing Wallace up
with a "Theater of Life" company.  They stage pretend murders in real
houses, and the participant gets to live a fantasy criminal life.
Since the theater lasts until almost midnight, this seems the perfect
mechanism for James to rid himself of his unwanted brother.</P>
<P>     The one joke is that there is a real crime afoot, and Wallace, as
a sunglassed, pretend secret agent, gets in the middle of it by
mistake.  Wallace never realizes that he is in any danger so he has
great fun shooting and getting shot at.  When he finds a dead body, he
compliments the corpse on how real he looks.  Nothing fazes Wallace
including a real mugging.</P>
<P>     The purposely overcomplicated plot involves stolen letters of a
call girl named Lori, played by Joanne Whalley, who is blackmailing a
high government official.  The most dastardly deed comes from two
groups of secret agents, one British and one Russian.  As a job
security program, they plan on bombing the delegates in town to sign a
world-wide peace treaty.  After the explosion, they figure that the
heyday for the spooks, the cold war, will be back in full swing.</P>
<P>     With any actor other than Murray, the audience would probably grow
tired of the story within the first half hour.  But his subtle and
serious approach to the humor provides at least one big laugh every ten
minutes and lots of little ones in-between.  Murray makes Wallace so
believable that it is easy to live his secret agent life for a night
vicariously with him.</P>
<P>     Whalley, one of the most beautiful actresses working today, has
talent that is rarely utilized effectively.  Her performance in
SCANDAL, a film about the real Christine Keeler and John Profumo
scandal in the British government, shows what a tremendous actress she
can be.  Even in bad films, such as TRIAL BY JURY, she has managed to
stand out.  In THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE she complements Murray's
part perfectly without ever trying to upstage him.</P>
<P>     "Do you think I look silly in this outfit?"  Lori asks demurely
when Wallace first sees her in a slightly revealing maid's outfit with
a big heart on it.  "I could take it off if you like."  The occasional
sexual innuendo never gets much stronger than this, allowing director
Jon Amiel to bring in the picture with just a PG rating.  Given that
his last film was the excellent, but hard R picture, COPYCAT, Amiel
shows more versatility than most directors.</P>
<P>     THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE is a film more to be savored in person
than discussed after the fact.  Wallace himself says it best when asked
by a policemen what it is like to be a secret agent.  "They pay all
your expenses and your 'license to kill,'" explains Wallace.  "But
there's a downside.  Torture."  Well, actually not, but one must keep
up one's image.</P>
<P>     THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE runs 1:33.  It is rated PG for
language, innuendo, and comic violence.  Kids need to be ten to
appreciate the humor but the film would be acceptable for those a bit
younger as well.</P>
