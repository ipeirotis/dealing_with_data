<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Who has the right to investigate the Catholic Church on matters of
religion? The implicit answer given by the filmmaker, is that the
kingdom of God is within you, not in beautiful and expensive churches to
glorify his word. Therefore it is one's own responsibility to find the
truth. Now that doesn't sound too radical, or does it? The filmmaker
makes the claim that the closest we can get to the actual Aramaic words
of Jesus comes from the missing Gospel of Thomas discovered in the Dead
Sea Scrolls. Nevertheless, the church has not recognized that work and
in 1945 declared the work to be a heresy. That is the filmmaker's
version, but he's mistaken, it was not declared heretical: upon further
research I discovered that the church only said it was simply
non-canonical. As for it being unattainable and suppressed by the
church, that's hogwash, I've owned a copy of it since the 1970s and
anyone can order it in a bookstore.</P>
<P>The real aim of the film, thusly, becomes one of showing the power
struggle between the faithful followers of the canonical and those who
oppose them by following the apocryphal, as the word of God. The
in-fighting within the church has always been of a political nature and
it should not be that surprising that the establishment of the church
wishes to preserve its power base and continue to set the standards for
its rituals, miracles, and what is to be the true Catholic religion.
That the film doesn't always stick to its aim and gets mired down in
unnecessary subplots, is what disappointed me most about this story that
could have been... well, great! That is, if it were in the hands of a
filmmaker who was more accurate in his details.</P>
<P>The film uses the supernatural as its storyline. Stigmata are bleedings
from the same five wounds received by the crucified Jesus: nails through
the wrists and feet, lashes on the back, scratches on the scalp from the
crown of thorns, and a spear through the side. That it is only those
deeply devoted to Jesus Christ and God who receive this gift, presents a
problem to the church when it happens to an atheist in the film- which
makes the story controversial with the church. St. Francis of Assissi,
in the 13th century, was the first to have received these "so called"
gifts of God.</P>
<P>Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne), who is a trained scientist
investigates and mostly disproves miracles, working for the Vatican's
"Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints." He is sent by his boss,
Cardinal Houseman (Jonathan Pryce), (which is an appropriate name for
him, because his whole purpose in life is to maintain the right of the
church at any cost of the truth), to investigate a miracle taking place
in a small Brazilian church. As a scientist he can't find anything phony
about the blood tear drops coming out of the Virgin Mary statue, and his
report to Cardinal Houseman that this miracle might be authentic, is met
with displeasure by him.</P>
<P>Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette), is a 23-year-old Pittsburgh
hairdresser who is an avowed partygoer and a confessed atheist and who
has the misfortune of receiving a gift from her vacationing mother of a
rosary bead that was stolen from the dead priest (Father Alameida) of
the Brazilian miracle church. Father Alameida (Donner) is a translator
of the forbidden Thomas Gospel, the one that could supposedly topple the
foundation of the Catholic Church.</P>
<P>Within hours of touching the rosary beads, Frankie is in the hospital
with a deep puncture
wound in each wrist - the first of the five stigmata she will endure for
the length of the film. The hospital thinks she is suicidal and that the
wounds are self-inflicted. She receives the second stigmata, lacerations
on her back with the lashes of a whip, while on a subway train, that is
witnessed by a priest, who contacts Rome sending them the security video
taken from the train. The hospital this time is checking her for
epilepsy. But Cardinal Houseman when he hears about this case, assigns
Father Kiernan to squelch any talk of the stigmata that the press has
reported. The story will now begin to focus on the relationship of the
two doubters, Frankie and Father Kiernan, as they both have a chance to
re-evaluate what their faith is because of these incidents. It has also
become apparent that Frankie has become the messenger for the holy
Father Alameida and when possessed speaks in the ancient Aramaic tongue,
spilling out the Thomas Gospel she doesn't even know exists and writing
it on the wall of her apartment.</P>
<P>The filmmaker shows that anything about the church can be argued away by
them. For instance, when Frankie tells Father Kiernan that she can't
have the stigmata because she is bleeding from her wrists and on all the
church statues the blood is coming from the palms of the hand. He
responds, by telling her the artists interpreted it that way, not
realizing that the Crucifixion couldn't support the weight of a body on
the hands. This very revealing statement of how inaccurate all the
Christian icons are magnifies the point the filmmaker is making, that
even the eyewitnesses to the event all saw things their own way and to
dogmatize them without questioning them, makes for a very questionable
religion.</P>
<P>Director Wainright tries hard to make Stigmata to be an unconventional
film, with a "hip" musical score (Smashing Pumpkins) and a mod style of
camera shots and montages. By using many different fanciful camera
angles, he allows you to feel the pain of the Crucifixion while we see
nails driven into Frankie's wrists. There are many other disturbing
images, such as broken glass moved by a spiritual wind, doves appearing
out of nowhere, ominous bird feathers, and dripping blood, which add,
unfortunately, to the incredibility of the story. During the sequences
in which Frankie receives her wounds, there are a number of quick cuts
between her body in agony and a crucified male, and many slow motion
shots emphasizing the agony over and over again. The dazzling
cinematography even makes the rainy weather and bad traffic jams of
Pittsburgh look like an inferno, while it switches gears and goes to the
contrasting opulence of the Vatican and the poverty of the Brazil
village, where the faithful flock to the miracle church.</P>
<P>Though there are many films (Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Omen) trying
their hand in this supernatural and religious thriller genre, this film
tries a somewhat different look to it (but those demon voices coming out
of Frankie, sure sounded like Linda Blair's possessed voice in the
Exorcist). Some of the things the filmmaker tried to do can certainly be
questioned as to their effectiveness, especially the over-the-top
special effects (especially weak was the fire during the closing scene,
it was overwrought with symbolism and inaccuracies) and, what might even
be a worst cheapening of the film, was the romantic suggestions between
the handsome priest and the troubled girl who just wanted to get her
life back and "loves being me." In my opinion, these were distractions
to an already complicated story, a story if it is to be taken seriously
has to remain focused on what it was aiming for and not try to tell more
of the corruptions in the Catholic Church than it could handle.</P>
<P>The romantic hints between the two were fine to a certain extent, it
made the point that a priest's disavowal of sex has its complications
just like sex does for ordinary people. But when it went for overkill
and tried to show how human the priest was, that he was more affected by
saving the girl's life and giving her love than he was in preserving
church dogma, I just thought it became too cheesy to show him in bed
with her and ogling her like he was in love with her, that, for me, was
going over the top. I have no idea where the director was trying to go
with that. It just opened the film up for unnecessary criticism, and I
wanted this film to succeed without those kind of distractions because I
thought it was onto something. What it had to say was a rational
response to such an authoritarian institution that cannot readily accept
challenges from within or without. I don't see the story as an
anti-religious film, as much as I saw it as a challenge to having one
way of looking at religion. In order to challenge the church, there is
no doubt that feathers have to be ruffled, but as I saw the film, the
Catholic community was mostly treated with respect and the essential
need for religion was never in question. It is only from the film's
ogre, sneeringly played by Jonathan Pryce, that we see a one-dimensional
predictable performance. He is evil from- the beginning to the end- of
the film, and how he ends up is just Hollywood hokum, leaving me
disappointed that the filmmaker would abandon their philosophical
argument via the force of ideas and have to resort to making the
Cardinal look like a strangler. Wainwright should have had enough
convictions in the strong ideas he presented about his kind of religion
being a personal one and should have let the quick lesson he gave us on
how the church examines miracles, to be enough of a case against the
church and let it go at that.</P>
<P>I was mostly impressed with Gabriel Byrne as a priest. His low-key
approach to this role was the glue that held the film together and made
it possible for non-believers such as me, to believe that there was some
faint hope for the church to actually be spiritual in a universal and
unbiased sense. I was not particularly moved by Patricia Arquette's
performance, as the young lady who was afraid that she was dying for
something she didn't believe in. I just couldn't warm up to her sexy
dumb hairdresser characterization, it seemed too funky and since she was
the brunt of most of the special effects, it all seemed like an Exorcist
movie going on for too long, losing any rationality and prospective of
what this film was supposed to be about.</P>
<P>Depending on what you are looking for when you view this movie, is what
kind of reaction you should have to it. If you view it as a horror
movie, then you are in for a big disappointment. This film is more silly
than scary, and less funny than risible. But if you look upon it as a
challenging religious conspiratory film, the way I saw it, a film that
examines the past power structure of the church and the power that the
church has today, then you might see a film that is more interesting
than you would be led to believe by the way it was advertised and by the
way some critics felt that it was their duty to defend the "poor"
Catholic Church from such an attack. In any case, I thought the film was
not anti- religious, just critical of churchly abuses, which makes it a
disturbing film in some circles.</P>
<P>In my opinion, despite all its faults, the film is still a thinking
man's film. That the church has blindly protested the movie, is of no
concern to me. I think, on the contrary, they should be grateful for
this film; we seem to be living at a time when a lot of people realize
that they can't look someplace other than to themselves for answers and
people are either fleeing from religion or coming back to it to look for
deeper answers or looking for completely new religious experiences
(drugs, cults, spirtualism, etc.). The filmmakers have not disavowed the
institution of the church or belief in a God, but just question its
search for truth. The film raised some serious questions that should be
answered by the church. By protesting this movie without recognizing
that many people don't want to have religion forced down their throat,
leaves the church in a vulnerable position (no one questions their right
to do that, just the wisdom of their protest). This film should be seen
as an opportunity for the church to see what those who are critical of
it are saying and they should not be afraid of the truth, even if it
means they have to change.</P>
<P>It is easy to lose track that this film is a serious one, despite the
MTV feel the movie has to it, and that is what surprised me more than
anything else about it. But what makes it fascinating, is why the
filmmaker thinks the church can be toppled by this new gospel. In the
past the church has always been able to be astute and co-opt anything it
gets its hands on, for its own benefit. A better film would have veered
away from the sensational and stuck to the nuts and bolts of its
argument. But with that being said, it is interesting to hear what the
director Rupert Wainwright says, `It was our goal to present this story
as an unbelievable, yet wholly possible phenomenon,' and like it or not
that's what the film does.</P>
