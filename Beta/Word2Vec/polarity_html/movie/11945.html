<P>     The working title for NO LOOKING BACK was LONG TIME, NOTHING NEW, 
and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture.  Even 
though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes, it seems 
to run long enough to engulf two TITANICs.  Writer/director Edward Burns 
has trotted out a hackneyed storyline, the trajectory of which will be 
instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in 
seclusion.  Instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the 
proceedings, Burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly 
towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion, offering precious few 
momentary pleasures along the way.</P>
<P>     NO LOOKING BACK is dominated by three very dislikable characters 
whose constant presence on the screen is painful.  The most appropriate 
ending would have been a triple suicide, and the sooner, the better.  
Alas, that's not the case, and those who stick with this film for its 
entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this 
wretched trio.  And, to further depress audiences, Burns has shot the 
entire film on cold, rainy days in a gray New York State beach town.  
Peeks of sunshine are few and far between.  No wonder the characters are 
all so miserable.</P>
<P>     First of all, we have Charlie (Burns), a Generation X slacker who 
abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion, then 
spent some time bumming around in California before deciding to come 
home.  That girlfriend is Claudia (Lauren Holly), and, after picking up 
the pieces of her life following Charlie's departure, she has moved on, 
shacking up with one of Charlie's old school buddies, Mike (Jon Bon 
Jovi).  The two have a comfortable relationship, but it's apparent to 
even a blind person that they're not right for each other.  Claudia 
years for some spice in her life; Mike wants to settle down and have 
children.  Then Charlie re-enters the mix.  So who, if anyone, will 
Claudia end up with?</P>
<P>     Who cares??  NO LOOKING BACK goes to extraordinary lengths to make 
sure that we're not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic 
triangle.  So what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don't 
deserve it anyway, especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time.  
They aren't real people -- they're a writer's construct stumbling 
through a too-obvious storyline.  They should know the ending as well as 
we do.  And Burns should have given his audience more credit and 
presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two.  </P>
<P>     Another frustrating thing about NO LOOKING BACK is that Burns has 
populated the film with a group of potentially-interesting supporting 
characters.  Blythe Danner is solid as Claudia's housebound mother, 
Connie Britton is suitably high-strung as Claudia's neurotic sister, and 
Jennifer Esposito is eye-catching as a bartender in search of a little 
romance. Sadly, all we get is quick glimpses into their lives, although 
a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the 
story Burns has chosen to tell.</P>
<P>     None of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their 
thespian attributes.  Edward Burns is pushing the edge of his limited 
range here.  Jon Bon Jovi shows more acting ability than one might 
reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career, but 
he could still use a little polish.  The worst case is Lauren Holly, who 
presents a completely bland Claudia.  As portrayed here, she's hardly 
the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment's interest, not to 
mention undying love.  Burns' ex, the monumentally untalented Maxine 
Bahns, would have been hard-pressed to do a less inspired job.</P>
<P>     When he released THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, Edward Burns was revered as 
the wunderkind of the 1995 Sundance Film Festival (Robert Redford has 
apparently stuck with him -- the aging actor/director executive produced 
this mess).  Two films and three short years later, the luster has 
faded.  Some movie makers have only one good film in them.  With back-
to-back duds like SHE'S THE ONE and NO LOOKING BACK to follow the 
delightful BROTHERS, Burns is beginning to look like a member of that 
undistinguished club. </P>
