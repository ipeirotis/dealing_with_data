<PRE>Review by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>There's not much in the way of thrills or surprises in this minor noir
film, one that is able to combine a story about diamond smugglers and a
smallpox outbreak in the New York City of 1947. It is based on the real
threat of a smallpox epidemic for New York City that took place in 1946.
The thin story is taken from a Cosmopolitan magazine article by Milton
Lehman. It is mildly diverting because of its able depiction of
America's cold war paranoia during the early 1950s against anything
foreign, as the film shows how an entire city can become terror stricken
by something unknown attacking it.</P>
<P>Upon entering New York City's Pennsylvania Station from Cuba, Sheila
Bennet (Keyes) senses she is being followed by custom's police. The
former singer has teamed up with her good-for-nothing husband, a piano
player, Matt Krane (Korvin), to smuggle $50,000 worth of diamonds into
the country. To make sure that you know that he is the heavy in the
story, he will speak with a foreign accent. Everything foreign in this
film is either connected with something sick or with something dangerous
to America.</P>
<P>Not going straight home to her husband, whom she calls at the station,
but instead going to a hotel on her husband's suggestion, she finds
herself feeling ill and anxious to rest up at home. He is two-timing her
with her own sister, Francie (Lola), who is seen by the viewer in the
apartment when she calls. Sheila excitedly tells him that she mailed the
diamonds to him because the cop was following her and will try to lose
the tail following her before coming home.</P>
<P>She is able to give the T-agent (Kelley) the slip by having the bellhop
(Burke) show her the back way out. Feeling sick, she nearly faints on
the street, as a cop takes her to a local clinic. There, she comes into
contact with a sweet young girl (Washburn) who is being taken to the
hospital for whooping cough. She feels very maternal to her, giving the
little girl a pin ornament she was wearing that caught the girl's eye.</P>
<P>Dr. Ben Wood treats her for a cold, giving her a medicine and telling
her to go home and get some rest. Later, when he checks on the little
girl admitted to the hospital, he is startled to find that she has come
down with an illness that has been eradicated from most of the world
since the Middle Ages, smallpox.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, after returning home and feeling sick, Sheila becomes aware
that Matt has left both her and her sister, but he can't leave town
completely because he has to wait ten days before his fence (Smith) will
pay him off. He is told the diamonds are too hot to handle.</P>
<P>The city is thrown into a panic, as a few cases of smallpox develop. The
city decides to vaccinate everyone, but runs out of the serum, causing a
panic in the city. Coming into contact with Sheila and taking sick with
smallpox: are the train porter, Sheila's milk deliveryman, and her
nightclub boss Willie (Backus). The T-agent and Dr. Wood, who is in
charge of finding the smallpox carrier, realize that they are looking
for the same person and through a lead from Willie, trace her to her
brother's flophouse in the Bowery. But she escapes from them there and
goes to Dr. Wood's office requesting more of the medicine he gave her.
When he wants her to turn herself in, she shoots him in the shoulder and
escapes.</P>
<P>Sheila manages to stay alive because she has to kill Matt and settle the
score she has with him. This, supposedly, keeps her going, while the
one's she gave the disease to are dropping like flies, including the
little girl.</P>
<P>In the final scene, she waits for Matt in the fence's place and forces
him out on the ledge of the high-rise office building, where he looses
his balance and falls to the pavement. This seems to exact the same
punishment for him that he exacted from Francie, who committed suicide
when he left her and her sister confronted her that she knew about the
affair with her husband. Dr. Wood, who seems to be omniscient, appears
on the ledge to rescue Sheila and he gets all the information he needs
on how and where she got the disease and all the people she was in
contact with, before she dies.</P>
<P>The action part of the melodramatic story was weakly told, while the
noir characterizations of Sheila did capture the desperate feelings of
the subject, but it was not enough to overcome the overall inability of
the story to have a heart to it. The city officials and Dr. Wood running
around the city to stem the epidemic, seemed hard to fathom. The
mechanical acting by everyone, except for Keyes, and the unconvincing
action scenes made the film appear as the B film it was, despite the
great noir camerawork of  Joseph Biroc, who caught how dark the city
could be for someone on-the-run.</P>
