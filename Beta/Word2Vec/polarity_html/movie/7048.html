<P>     The reason inspired satire is so rare nowadays is that people have
been given a warped perception of what satire is.  The popular culture --
fed by "Saturday Night Live," David Letterman and even political pundits
-- has created the notion that irony, sarcasm and satire are
interchangeable, and that there is something inherently hip about ridicule
as a spectator sport.  But it takes no imagination to savage someone or
something you despise; the best satire in any medium has been born of
affection, from people with a gift for pointing out the negative while
recognizing the positive.  THIS IS SPINAL TAP, the best comedy of the
1980s, was a brilliant satire of the excesses of rock and roll which also
respected the commitment of the artists to their work.  WAITING FOR
GUFFMAN, a comedy from TAP alum Christopher Guest, is a more uneven
effort, but it is at its funniest skewering small-town America in all its
cockeyed optimism.</P>
<P>     WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is set in fictional Blaine, Missouri, a peaceful
little town preparing to celebrate its 150th birthday.  Part of that
celebration will be an original musical production called "Red, White and
Blaine," and it is placed in the hands of New York theater expatriate
Corky St. Clair (Christopher Guest).  Corky has big plans for the big
event, and builds a cast including local community theater veterans Ron
(Fred Willard) and Sheila Albertson (Catherine O'Hara) and first-time
performers Dr. Allan Pearl (Eugene Levy) and Libby Mae Brown (Parker
Posey).  The production faces crises great and small as the
sesquicentennial approaches, but even more exciting than the show itself
is the prospect of a visit from a New York producer named Mort Guffman,
who may offer to take the show to Broadway.</P>
<P>     Publicity for WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is emphasizing the SPINAL TAP
connection by describing Guest as "the lead guitarist of Spinal Tap," but
I don't think that comparison does GUFFMAN any favors.  Yes, it is
similarly filmed in a faux documentary style, and derives a similar
off-beat energy from its largely improvised script.  However, there are
fewer outrageous high points, largely the result of a less inherently
outrageous milieu.  The more you expect a middle-American SPINAL TAP, the
more time you might spend waiting for the inevitable disasters in the play
which turn out to be not so inevitable after all.</P>
<P>     It may take sitting through all of "Red, White and Blaine" before it
becomes clear that WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is not going to be a parade of
incompetence, though Guest (who co-wrote the story with co-star Levy) does
have fun with the cloistered perspectives of his characters.  The
Albertsons, who are travel agents by day, turn out never to have left the
state of Missouri themselves; a reported alien visitation in 1946 is so
much a part of Blaine's history that it makes its way into the pageant as
an accepted fact.  Most memorably, nobody in the town seems to notice that
Corky is as stereotypically homosexual a human being as has ever walked
the earth.  Guest has taken some heat for his swishy portrayal, but I
think such criticism misses the point.  Everyone watching the film
understands that Corky is supposed to be gay, but no one _in_ the film
understands it.  Gay men simply are not part of their world, so no one
thinks twice about why they have never seen Corky's "wife" Bonnie, or
about his exaggerated mannerisms being anything but "theatrical."</P>
<P>     The real subject of WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, however, isn't merely how
narrow the world-view of Blaine's residents may be, but how the residents
involved in the production respond to a whiff of big city show-biz.  For
Corky, "Red, White and Blaine" is his chance to return to the big time;
for Dr. Pearl, a latent comedic legend in his own mind, it is a spark of
excitement in his otherwise monotonous life.  You may spend much of
WAITING FOR GUFFMAN waiting for "Red, White and Blaine" to be terrible,
but it isn't terrible.  The orchestra, conducted with intense pride by the
high school music teacher (Bob Balaban) sounds pretty good, the songs
(written by Guest and his fellow Tap-ers Michael McKean and Harry Shearer)
are silly but hum-able, and the actors are amateurs who give the show all
they've got.  It is simply ridiculous, of course, that a show like this
could ever go to Broadway, but the performers are too wonderfully naive to
recognize that fact.  WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is occasionally sluggish through
its middle half hour, and hardly the non-stop riot SPINAL TAP was; it also
treats its characters with far more good-humored respect than you might
expect.  Guest understands that it is possible to laugh at people and
still love them, and that fine satire can be achieved with the poke of a
finger as well as a sledgehammer.</P>
