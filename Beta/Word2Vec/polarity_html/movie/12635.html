REVERSAL OF FORTUNE
A film by Barbet Schroeder
With: Jeremy Irons, Ron Silver, Glenn Close, Fisher Stevens, and 
Annabella Sciorra</PRE>
<P>    Did Claus Von Bulow try to kill his wife Sunny in their Newport 
mansion?  That is the question Reversal of Fortune asks you to consider 
as it opens in a hospital ward, with a comatose Sunny Von Bulow.  She is 
the main narrator of the film, in a narrative trick that was 
extraordinarily risky for Schroeder.  The dramatic trick works, as Sunny 
Von Bulow narrates a compelling story of murder, sex, unhappiness, and a 
lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win.</P>
<P>Jeremy Irons is Claus Von Bulow, in what is his finest role, and one 
of the most devastingly evil performances in history.  He is as hated as 
any man alive, as cold as a cucumber.  His remorse for his wife's 
comatose condition is nonexistant, and it is no wonder that even his 
children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during 
Christmas, 1980.</P>
<P>The background to the case is such.  During Christmas of 1979, Sunny 
Von Bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke.  The 
same situation occured in 1980, only Sunny never woke, and probably 
never will.  When examined, it was found that she had 14 times the 
normal amount of insulin within her blood.  Claus Von Bulow is then 
accused of attempted murder by his stepson, convicted, and freed on 
bail.  He immediately hires Alan Dershowitz, the renowed Harvard Law 
professor, to acquit him.   </P>
<P>Ron Silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what 
has happened to him.  We follow him through two very different cases; 
the case of the Johnson case, where two innocent kids are standing on 
Death Row for a crime they didn't commit, and von Bulow, who he still 
hasn't figured out.  Dershowitz doesn't know what happened to Sunny, and 
he is extremely hesitant to take the case.  Nevertheless, he does, based 
on certain things which happen during the investigative process that 
deeply upset him.  Together with a group of law students, Dershowitz 
concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed. </P>
<P>Silver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep 
film.  Schroeder directs on many different levels, with multiple plot 
lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of Alan Dershowitz.  There 
are flaws; at times, the film gets overly theatrical.  Yet, due to Glenn 
Close's troubled and brutally honest performance as Sunny von Bulow, the 
use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well.  The 
flashbacks are good, but at times Schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks.  
The movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain 
developments during the film, and it could have used a better ending.  
The film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly, without any 
intelligent conclusion.  The supporting characters are often neglected, 
and Dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise, 
but Schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters.</P>
<P>Yet, for all these flaws, the film is deeply engrossing because of 
Irons.  As von Bulow, he is brutally evil.  Anti-Semitic, prejudiced, 
arrogant, protective, he is a rotten, lying monster, whose conviction 
may have been wrong legally, but morally he was to blame.  Irons plays 
him to a cold perfection, with pathetic attempts to gain moral support 
for his claims to innocence.  He is an adulterous liar and a cheat who 
in all likelihood committed the murder. </P>
<P>However, the genius of Reversal of Fortune comes in its distinction 
between moral culpability and legal responsibility.  There is no doubt 
von Bulow is responsible for his wife's death by years of neglect and 
coldness.  However, legally, did he do the murder?  Schroeder dares the 
viewer to make up his own mind.  With all the character flaws, Reversal 
of Fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent; he wants 
the viewer to make up his own mind.  Schroeder taunts the viewer with 
contradictory revelations, and then mentions that the answer to this 
compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join Sunny von Bulow, in 
death.  For all the failed dramatic theatrics, this is one that works 
beautifully.  We don't know what happened.  That sense of legal 
ambiguousness, along with von Bulow's obvious moral guilt, is why 
Reversalf Fortune works.  In the end, von Bulow is as sadistic as ever.  
Irons is haunting, and that is why Reversal of Fortune is so good.</P>
