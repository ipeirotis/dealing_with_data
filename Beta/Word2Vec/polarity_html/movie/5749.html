Reviewed by Scott Renshaw.</P>
<P>     Once upon a time, Francis Ford Coppola was one of the most revered
directors in the world, the creator of classic films like THE GODFATHER,
THE GODFATHER PART 2 and THE CONVERSATION, part of an American renaissance
of the 1970s which included names like Scorsese, Spielberg and Altman.
Then came films which politely could be called ambitious failures -- ONE
FROM THE HEART, THE COTTON CLUB, TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS DREAM -- and
mixed critical reception for his third GODFATHER film and BRAM STOKER'S
DRACULA.  It has been four years since DRACULA, more time to wonder if
Coppola could once again summon that special something.  What he has
summoned instead is JACK, a frustrating patchwork of slapstick and
sentimentality in which almost everything feels forced.</P>
<P>     JACK begins with expectant parents Karen (Diane Lane) and Brian
Powell (Brian Kerwin) receiving an unexpected surprise at a costume party:
Karen goes into labor, despite being only ten weeks pregnant.  However,
the baby she delivers appears to be full-term, leading doctors to conclude
that he has a genetic anomaly which causes him to age four times faster
than normal.  Indeed, when Jack Powell (Robin Williams) is ten years old,
he looks like a forty year old man, and is kept at home to be instructed
by a tutor (Bill Cosby).  But Jack longs for the company of other
children, and finally his parents allow him to enter the fifth grade.
Naturally, he is treated as a freak by his classmates, but when he is
accepted by a boy named Louie (Adam Zolotin), Jack begins to learn what it
means to have friends.</P>
<P>     At least that's what I think he learns.  One of the reasons JACK
feels so muddled is that it is a film without a clear sense of who its
vibrant character is.  In films of this type, where someone who is
"different" teaches those who are "normal" some Valuable Life Lessons(TM), 
the main character usually isn't that character, but rather the catalyst
who inspires others to change.  Those others might be Jack's classmates,
who come to accept and even to love him, and Louie gets a heartfelt and
inspiring speech to share those feelings.  At other times it appears that
Jack is supposed to be the character who is meant to change; he too gets a
heartfelt and inspiring speech.  Diane Lane doesn't get a heartfelt and
inspiring speech, just plenty of heartfelt looks to tell us that she is
learning to be less protective of Jack.  There is no law which states that
only one character in a film can change, but we have to know with whom we
are meant to identify, and Coppola spends so much time being heartfelt
that he fails to provide a definite protagonist.</P>
<P>     That leaves JACK as a message film in which there is no clear
message.  According to Louie's speech, it is that we should all remain
kids at heart; according to Jack's speech, it is that we should live each
day to the fullest.  JACK will quite naturally inspire a great deal of
comparison to 1988's BIG, but BIG was a pure fantasy which never felt the
need to underline its lessons.  Coppola and screenwriters James DeMonaco
and Gary Nadeau try to incorporate scenes of boys-will-be-boys playfulness
(and who among us hasn't been initiated into a club by lighting our bodily
gases or eating disgusting food mixtures), as if to tell us "we're just
having fun here."  That might be easier to accept if they hadn't also
overwhelmed simple moments like Jack calculating his mortality with the
uberdramatic voice-over, "What do I want to be when I grow up?  Alive."</P>
<P>     JACK's ace-in-the-hole would seem to be never-quite-grown-up Robin
Williams in the lead role, but there is something about his performance
which feels uncertain.  Admittedly it is an extremely challenging part --
he's playing not just a 10-year-old, but a maladjusted 10-year-old -- but
Williams more often seems to be acting like a 6-year-old, just a step away
from the baby-talk character he often used in his stand-up comedy
routines, while his 10-year-old co-stars often act like they're 16.
Williams is a sharp, quick-witted performer, and he always seems to be
struggling when he's asked to play whimsical (remember TOYS, or BEING
HUMAN?).</P>
<P>     Coppola certainly knows how to make a good-looking film, with some
clever touches like shots of Jack's light-up sneakers.  But JACK usually
comes off as sentiment without sense, and comedy without a foundation.
Once upon a time, Francis Ford Coppola appeared to know all there was to
know about making movies.  Now, he doesn't even seem to know JACK.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 growing pains:  4.</PRE>
