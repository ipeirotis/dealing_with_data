<P>"Blue, liberty; White, equality; Red, fraternity ....  We looked very 
closely at these three ideas, how they functioned in everyday life, but 
from an individual's point of view.  These ideals are contradictory with 
human nature.  When you deal with them practically, you do not know how 
to live with them.  Do people really want liberty, equality, fraternity?" 
            - Writer/director Krzysztof Kieslowski </P>
<P>     RED, the final chapter of Krzysztof Kieslowski's THREE COLORS
trilogy, is a subtle masterpiece.  With its satisfying exploration of
such complex and diverse themes as destiny and platonic love, RED is
not only a self-contained motion picture, but a fitting conclusion to
the series. Through one brief-but-important scene, this movie adds
closure to both BLUE and WHITE, tying both to each other and to RED,
and thereby reinforcing the commonality of ideas threaded through all
three.</P>
<P>     This time around, the protagonists are a young woman named
Valentine (Irene Jacob, who starred in Kieslowski's THE DOUBLE LIFE OF
VERONIQUE) and a crotchety retired judge, Joseph Kern (Jean-Louis
Trintignant).  Valentine, a fashion model, meets the judge after
running down his dog in the street and taking the injured animal to the
address listed on the collar.  Kern is initially indifferent to his
pet's predicament, telling Valentine to keep the dog if that's what she
wants.  She does; however, the animal eventually runs away and finds
its way back to the judge's.  When Valentine goes searching, she
inadvertently learns Kern's secret--he enjoys spying on people by
illegally tapping into their phone conversations.</P>
<P>     Told in parallel with the chronicle of the unusual friendship
between Valentine and the judge is the story of two lovers that Kern
spies upon.  Auguste (Frederique Feder) and Karin (Marion Stalens),
seem devoted to each other, but fate has already cast its die against
them.  For Auguste's life is eerily similar to that of Kern thirty
years ago and, like the older man, he is drawn by forces beyond his
control towards Valentine.</P>
<P>     Thematically, RED is the strongest of the three films.  Its
construction allows hardly a moment to pass when the viewer isn't
considering how fate manipulates the lives of Valentine, Auguste, Kern,
and Karin--not to mention the characters from BLUE and WHITE (reprised
oh-so-briefly by Juliette Binoche, Benoit Regent, Zbigniew Zamachowski,
and Julie Delpy).  Then there's the meaning of platonic love (or
"fraternity")--friendship completely divorced from sexual overtones
(maybe Billy Crystal's character from WHEN HARRY MET SALLY should see
this film).  Kieslowski shows exactly how multi-faceted any
relationship can be, and what occasionally must be sacrificed to the
basic human need of finding a kindred spirit.</P>
<P>     RED also toys with foreshadowing in a very literal sense.  A shot
of Valentine used for a billboard ad ("A Breath of Life") presages
something that later happens to her in real life.  It is this moment,
more than any other, that crystalizes everything that the THREE COLORS
trilogy is attempting to convey about life and destiny.</P>
<P>     While RED lacks the emotional depth of BLUE and the dark humor of
WHITE, it more than makes up for these with its textual and stylistic
richness.  The red-saturated visuals by Polish cinematographer Piotr
Sobocinski are crisp and consistently atmospheric, and the score by
Zbigniew Preisner is at full power (after being shunted into the
background in WHITE).</P>
<P>     The performances are without flaw.  Irene Jacob is mesmerizing as
Valentine, a woman unknowingly trapped in fate's web.  As is true of
the other female leads in the THREE COLORS trilogy, her acting ability
matches her screen luminance.  Jean-Louis Trintignant presents a multi-
layered character whose final secrets are not revealed until late in
the film.  Frederique Feder and Marion Stalens are solid in supporting
roles.</P>
<P>     RED virtually demands more than one viewing for an appreciation of
the picture's ambitious scope.  Repeated examination of RED's narrative
and thematic structure makes it apparent what Kieslowski has
accomplished not only here, but through his entire trilogy.  It's a
tragedy that this movie will not be eligible for the Best Foreign Film
Oscar (Switzerland, the country of origin, has decided to reject RED
because of its strong French and Polish production elements), but the
lack of official recognition does not alter the fact that this is one
of 1994's exceptional motion pictures.</P>
