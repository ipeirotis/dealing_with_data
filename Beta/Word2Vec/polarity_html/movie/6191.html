<PRE>                    To Gillian On Her 37th Birthday (1996)
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  **</PRE>
<P>     Bittersweet comedies are tricky at best even under the most expert
guidance.  Director Micheal Pressman, who previously brought the world
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES II: THE SECRET OF OOZE, tries his hand at
a weeper with the mawkish title TO GILLIAN ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY and
ends up with a mess.</P>
<P>     This schmaltzy ode oscillates between comedy and tragedy, but only
the comedy is successful.  The script by David E. Kelley based on
Michael Brady's play has characters in constant banter that puts the
audience in stitches.  As soon as they begin to enjoy the film,
however, it switches back to its maudlin roots, and people just stare
at the screen not knowing what to make of its false sentimentality.</P>
<P>     The acting is equally uneven.  Ever handsome Peter Gallagher is
David Lewis.  Two years ago his wife Gillian, played by ever beautiful
Michelle Pfeiffer, died in a foolish bit of bravado on their yacht
while celebrating her 35th birthday.  Now, normally strange David, is
acting even stranger having long talks on the beach with his dead wife.
Other than looks, neither actor brings anything to the part.  Although
Pfeiffer gives one of the most insubstantial pieces of acting in her
career, Gallagher's acting is not much meatier.  The good news is that
the strong supporting cast, who are given all the comedic lines, almost
saves the film.</P>
<P>     Every year on Gillian's birthday, known to them as "Gillian's
Day", her sister Esther Wheeler (Kathy Bates) and Esther's husband Paul
(Bruce Altman), come to Nantucket Island to share the day with David,
Gillian, and their now 16 year old daughter Rachel (Claire Danes).
Just because Gillian has become an apparition appearing only to David
is no reason to cancel the festivities.</P>
<P>     Exactly two years after Gillian's death, the Wheelers make their
annual pilgrimage to the Lewis's isolated house on the island.  This
year they bring along a surprise blind date for David, a female named
Kevin Danford (Wendy Crewson).  David is taken aback and tells Paul,
"Don't you think it is a little insensitive fixing me up on her
birthday?"  Paul sternly retorts, "Gillian has no more birthdays."</P>
<P>     Rachel is worried about her Dad, but Esther consoles her with, "He
will be all right.  It's just, he really loved her."  Staying with
Rachel is her girlfriend Cindy Bayles (Laurie Fortier), and Cindy sets
Kevin straight with, "He's not going to fall for you.  Live people
can't compete with dead ones."</P>
<P>     Soon the seriousness passes for a bit, and we are into the fun
silliness of Gillian's Day.  As is the tradition, they do wild and
crazy things like break out the karaoke so they can sing old Barry
Manilow songs.  Most importantly, the day coincides with the island's
yearly sandcastle building contest.  David has a plan complete with
elaborate blueprints to build a Gothic castle and unseat the reigning
champion - a nine year old girl.  These scenes are off the wall and
very funny, but the laughter is all guarded because the audience knows
that this film will switch without warning to its somber core.</P>
<P>     Although thankfully not very often, Pfeiffer does show up in some
scenes.  When she does, she gets asinine little saccharine lines
including, "You're okay Mr. Man," and "Go play with the live girls."  I
am not making this up.  In fact, I don't think I am not even capable of
making up such drivel.</P>
<P>     The show is filled with mini-dramas.  One has Esther planning to
go to court to get custody of Rachel since her Dad is flipping out.
Another has Rachel getting drunk and throwing up on her father.  As I
said earlier, only the comedy works.</P>
<P>     There is one exception.  Paul constantly and overtly flirts with
seductive, but underage Cindy.  This subplot appears to be nothing more
substantial than the comedy about sandcastles, but in one intelligently
written scene, the flirting reaches a surprising conclusion.  This is
quite an insightful scene, and one that I had not expected to see in
such a trivial picture.  Most impressive is that once it starts, it
builds to an unexpected ending.</P>
<P>     Reliable James Horner comes through with some excellent music.  It
has all of the genuine romantic and dreamy aspects that the picture
itself lacks.  Similarly, Tim Suhrstedt's cinematography has a
wonderful and beautiful surreal feel.  The best scenes are the
nighttime ones of luminescent blues.</P>
<P>     GHOST is a much better picture that covers the same ground. I am
at a loss to explain why GILLIAN was made. Is the availability of good
looking leads suffice motivation to make a film?</P>
<P>     TO GILLIAN ON HER 37TH BIRTHDAY runs just 1:33.  It is now rated
PG-13, but reportedly they made last minute adjustments to get an R
rating removed.  There is no sex, nudity, or violence.  Gillian's death
is not shown, just the fall.  The show includes a meaningless scene
where David uses the F word several time and argues about the number of
times he has used it.  The picture would have been stronger without the
scene and would have allowed younger kids to see it.  Even so, my guess
is that the show would be fine for most kids over say nine.  You can
make the decision knowing the F words are there.  I laughed a lot, but
was put off by the pseudo-serious parts so I can't quite bring myself
to recommend it.  I give it **.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
