<P>Arriving in a barrage of hype, The Blair Witch Project is one of the biggest
box office success of the year. However, like The Golden Child, although
Blair Witch has made a lot of money, it's not very good. Donahue, Williams
and Leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a
documentary about the Blair Witch myth. The film is made up of the camcorder
footage they recorded, which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles.
Although events start of normal, they get weird pretty quickly, while the
threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on.</P>
<P>Although an interesting premise, The Blair Witch Project amounts to nothing
more than a missed opportunity. The biggest mistake the film makes is to let
three mediocre actors the chance to improvise. Most of the dialogue is
ad-libbed, and still manages to sound like a poor B-movie. The 'script'
eventually degenerates into shouting matches, with the F-word included a lot
to sound like students. There are breaks in these arguments where some
creepy events occur, but then it's back to the shouting and swearing, which
gets very tiresome very quickly. If I wanted to see three people get lost in
the woods, shout a lot and swear, I'd go on scout camp. But no, the audience
is meant to  get some entertainment factor out of this, but I'm not quite
sure how.</P>
<P>The supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting, especially if
close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes. With
no music and no budget to work with, the film has to depend on natural,
psychological scares, which are sometimes well delivered, sometimes not. I
never really felt truly scared during any part of the film, although there
is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film. However, because
the actors are so irritating, the scares are lost when it eventually reverts
back to Heather saying 'What the f*ck is that?' a lot, and Mike giggling
like a loony.</P>
<P>There's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really
stupid things. The main problem is the fact that even though these hapless
bunch could be killed at any moment, and are hopelessly lost, Heather still
insists on filming it all. The film gives a half hearted reason why she
should want to do this, but it isn't very convincing. Also, the students
have no idea how to survive in the woods, such as following a large river
flowing through the woods to civilisation. There are also some parts where
the 'amateur' camcorder footage is obviously staged, Heather's apology being
a major one.</P>
<P>The Blair Witch Project, in the end, just fails to deliver. I suppose if
you've been lost camping before, the film may deliver some chills, but this
is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven't been lost in
the woods. Apart from the final minutes, the film is mind boggingly unscary,
and the shouting matches get hideously dull. The spook scenes are short and
far between, and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same
amount of fear that these scenes provide. Although a good idea, it's not
executed well enough to be a fun, scary cinema experience. It's a worrying
fact when the website (<A HREF="http://www.blairwitch.com">http://www.blairwitch.com</A>) is better than the film.</P>
