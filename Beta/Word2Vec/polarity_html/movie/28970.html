<PRE>JACKPOT
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2001 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>JACKPOT, the second picture by the Polish brothers, director and co-writer
Michael Polish and co-writer Mark Polish, tackles the world of competitive
karaoke singing.  Their first film, TWIN FALLS IDAHO, a love story with
co-joined twins, was one of a kind.  But people will, undoubtedly, compare their
latest film with last year's hopeless DUETS, another family affair, featuring
father Bruce Paltrow as the director and daughter Gwyneth Paltrow as the star. 
The surprise is that the disappointing DUETS is the livelier of the two.  Even
without the DUETS comparison, however, the gloomy JACKPOT has all of the fizz of
a soda left open overnight.</P>
<P>When we meet Sunny Holiday (Jon Gries) and his manager Lester Irving (Garrett
Morris), they are on a 43-city tour in an old, shocking pink land yacht. 
Looking like they haven't got a nickel to their name, they brag to a reporter
that Sunny has made a fortune.  How much exactly?  Well, "thousands."  Lester
always gets his fifteen percent, which one night means that his total earnings
amount to the lid on the blender that Sunny wins.  Grizzled veterans of the
karaoke wars, they both sport scraggly beards and cheap clothing.  About the
only thing that separates them in physical appearance is that Sunny is a middle
aged white guy, while Lester is an older black man.  Lester is fond of asking
the good Lord's help before Sunny heads to the stage for the evening's battle. 
In other long, uninteresting scenes, Lester offers Sunny lots of unsolicited
advice on how to be successful.  "Sleeping in a car doesn't guarantee you'll
become a star," is one of the aphorisms that Lester comes up with.  Lester is
clearly someone who never takes his own advice.</P>
<P>The movie features some known actors in cameo performances.  Daryl Hannah plays
Sunny's wife, Bobbi.  In repetitive flashbacks, she keeps expressing her strong
displeasure with his "fantasy tour."  Anthony Edwards shows up, and that's about
it.  The best piece of work comes from Peggy Lipton ("The Mod Squad") as a woman
who has a one-night stand with Sunny.</P>
<P>It's never clear what kind of movie JACKPOT wants to be.  Among the stranger
subplots are one involving soap scamming and another about a Lolita-like
seductress named Tangerine (Camellia Clouse), who only wants Sunny "to sign her
yearbook."  Tangi, as she likes to be called, looks to be a 16-year-old going on
13.  Dressed in frilly and revealing clothes, she lures Sunny into a pink
bedroom that looks like it should belong to her younger sister.  What happens
or, more precisely, what doesn't quite happen there is either funny or creepy,
but it's not clear which.  JACKPOT is like that scene.  It's not clear how to
take it, and with its lack of energy, we end up not caring.</P>
<P>JACKPOT runs 1:35.  It is rated R for language and sexuality and would be
acceptable for most teenagers.</P>
<P>The film opens nationwide in the United States on Friday, August 17, 2001.  In
the Silicon Valley, it will be showing at the Camera Cinemas and the AMC
theaters.  </P>
