<P>     I can understand why screenwriter Tina Andrews latched onto the story
behind WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE for fifteen years.  From a commercial
standpoint, it has a great hook:  the real-life story of three women who
all claimed to be the legal widow of Frankie Lymon, lead singer of the
1950s doo-wop group the Teenagers (whose signature hit serves as the
film's title).  From a writer's standpoint, it offers the intriguing
contradiction of its main character, a troubled soul who was a different
man for each of his three different brides before dying of a drug overdose
in 1968.  It's a story with sex, drugs _and_ rock 'n' roll, as well as
colorful characters a-plenty.  Sure enough, this bio-pic offers loads of
curb appeal.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, Andrews and director Gregory Nava (SELENA) make a big
mistake in their approach to the material -- they decide to turn it into a
rock 'n' roll RASHOMON.  The framing story opens in 1986, with three women
-- former Platters singer Zola Taylor (Halle Berry), petty thief and
single mom Elizabeth Waters (Vivica A. Fox), and schoolteacher Emira Eagle
(Lela Rochon) -- all making a legal claim to be Mrs. Frankie Lymon, with
rights to his musical royalties.  A hearing commences in which each
claimant tells the story of Frankie (Larenz Tate) as she knew him, from
teen star to has-been, from heroin addict to soldier.  The flashbacks
cover 13 years of Frankie's life, with widely varying perspectives on the
man each of the three women married at some point, but none of them
divorced.</P>
<P>     Somewhere buried in that narrative is an interesting -- if somewhat
trite -- entertainment industry life story, the story of a street kid from
an abusive home who becomes dependent on the love he receives from
audiences and women.  Larenz Tate does a fine job of capturing Frankie's
electrifying stage presence, as well as his sheer joy of performing for a
crowd.  In fact, the high-energy performance scenes are generally the
film's best, with Frankie's unbridled on-stage enthusiasm contrasting
sharply with the conservative choreography of his artistic contemporaries.
Tate also has the thankless job of creating a character out of piecemeal
recollections, yet the character still comes together as someone you want
to know more about.</P>
<P>     If only wanting made it so.  Only occasionally does WHY DO FOOLS FALL
IN LOVE hone in on the question of who Frankie Lymon really was.  Too
often Andrews and Nava take off on dead-end tangents -- a vamping,
self-indulgent cameo by Little Richard as himself; the hit-and-run
accusation that Frankie's manager/producer Morris Levy (Paul Mazursky)
cheated him out of millions; broadly comic female bonding sessions which
turn Zola, Elizabeth and Emira into the First, Second and Third Wives'
Club.  When they finally do get around to Frankie himself, they offer
psychologically convenient devices like a shattered mirror in which
Frankie sees his fragmented visage.  The individual snapshots of his life,
including such potentially provoactive subjects as his naive disregard for
1950s social conventions, never seem designed to develop into a complete
portrait.</P>
<P>     Ultimately no one, not even the three women with whom he shared a
life, seems interested in understanding Frankie.  That's what's most
disappointing about WHY DO FOOLS FALL IN LOVE:  it's not really a
biography of Frankie Lymon.  The film-makers are usually more interested
in getting inside the the heads of the three women -- providing tart
dialogue for the three talented lead actresses while making them
sympathetic, mis-used you-go-girls -- than getting inside Frankie's head.
Sure, they violate point of view when it serves their purpse to show
things none of the narrators could have seen, but mostly they point out
how Frankie's enigmatic behavior hurt others, not how he hurt himself.
It's a cop-out to start telling a character's story, then shrug your
shoulders and claim not to have any idea who that character is.  Tina
Andrews spent fifteen years waiting to tell the story of a potentially
fascinating rock 'n' roll tragedy, but all she could come up with was a
great big "I dunno."</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Frankies, my dear:  5.</PRE>
