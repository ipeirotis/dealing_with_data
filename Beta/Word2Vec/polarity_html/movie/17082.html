<PRE>PAYBACK</PRE>
<P>Starring: Mel Gibson, Gregg Henry, Maria Bello & David Paymer
Written by: Brian Helgeland and Terry Hayes
Directed by: Brian Helgeland</P>
<P>It is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than
enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and
play a less-than-savoury character as Mel Gibson does in Payback. Of
course, if I was being paid $25 million for one month's work, I'd probably
be willing to take risks as well, but that's neither here nor there.</P>
<P>Payback is based on a novel by Richard Stark (apparently actually Donald E.
Westlake, author of The Grifters, itself a fine crime film) which was also
filmed in the 1960s as Point Blank starring one of the toughest of tough
guys, Lee Marvin. The film opens with Gibson having recovered from being
shot several times in the back, by whom we don't know yet. All we know is
that Gibson, as Porter, isn't a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the
money stolen from him back, and getting even in the process, no matter what
the consequences.</P>
<P>It turns out that the man he's after is Val (Gregg Henry), his sometime
partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of Chinese
mobsters. Obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul, Val figures
Porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a
debt to his employers. Porter, however, is the sort of man who holds a
grudge and once on his feet, goes about exacting revenge on the
double-crossing Val.</P>
<P>Gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born
to play, that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn't mind beating up or
shooting people to get what he wants. You probably wouldn't see other
actors in his salary range take such an offbeat, out-of-character role such
as Porter (Jim Carrey won't be doing anything like this in a hurry after
what happened the last time he tried - The Cable Guy, anyone?). Harrison
Ford's idea of playing an unsympathetic character is Presumed Innocent; the
last time Schwarzenegger played a villain was Batman and Robin, which we
won't mention further; and has Stallone ever really played a villain at all?</P>
<P>This is not to say that Porter is a villain, per se. While he isn't the
sort of character you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of, he's
nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless
bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink
of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are.
Porter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his, which in a
way is almost understandable.</P>
<P>Payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't be
remembered as being among Gibson's most important work, but is still one of
the finer films he's done. The only real problem with it is that, while
everything seems to work out in the end, I was left feeling something was
lacking; was that all? The ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last
minute, and the final voice-over doesn't ring true, even though it was used
to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film
embodies. The film just ends far too suddenly, after a huge build-up in the
penultimate scenes.</P>
<P>A fine film, even though it needs just a little something more to be the
kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation. Just be ready
for a possible letdown of an ending.</P>
<PRE>4 out of 5</PRE>
