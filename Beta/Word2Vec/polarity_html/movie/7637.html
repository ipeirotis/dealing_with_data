<P>     I have come up with a definition -- admittedly arbitrary -- for 
"TV-movie" as it tends to be used in a derogatory fashion.  Melodrama
certainly plays a part in that definition, but it is more symptom than
disease.  The real problem with TV-movies is that they tend to be about
issues, not about people.  Melodrama results from a story about a 
situation; drama results from a story about people responding to a
situation.</P>
<P>     HOLLOW REED has been garnering some comparisons to TV-movies which 
are only half fair.  The story concerns that TV-movie standby the custody
battle, with a few provocative twists.  Young Oliver Wyatt (Sam Bould)
lives with his mother Hannah (Joely Richardson) and Hannah's new boyfriend
Frank (Jason Flemyng); Oliver's father Martyn (Martin Donovan) lives with
his gay lover Tom (Ian Hart).  One day Oliver shows up at Martyn's door
with injuries the boy claims came in a schoolyard fight, and later turns
up with a broken wrist supposedly slammed in a car door.  Martyn begins to
suspect that the cause of the injuries may be Frank, and sues for custody
when Hannah is unresponsive to his concerns.  Thus begins a legal battle
which will expose the biases in the system and force a family to confront
its own biases.</P>
<P>     HOLLOW REED really covers two issues, then:  domestic violence, and
attitudes about homosexuality both institutional and personal.  On the
first front, cries of "TV-movie" amount to utter nonsense.  Director
Angela Pope has crafted a splendid domestic drama which includes many
wrenching scenes of people coping with personal turmoil.  Sam Bould's
performance as Oliver is the centerpiece of that story, a quiet and
reflective piece of work which allows the audience to feel his fear,
confusion and isolation.  Oliver's perspective is everywhere, from furtive
glances through window blinds to the boy's use of a radio-controlled car
fitted with a rear-view mirror to observe things from a distance.  Pope
also includes a marvelous reconciliation scene between Hannah and Frank
which captures a dysfunctional relationship to chilling perfection.  As
long as HOLLOW REED is focused on the dynamics of Hannah, Frank and
Oliver, it is truly exceptional.</P>
<P>     There is, however, another issue with which to grapple, and the
grappling is frequently clumsy.  Martin Donovan, the laconic protagonist
of Hal Hartley's TRUST, SIMPLE MEN and FLIRT, here plays another laconic
protagonist.  In Hartley's films, Donovan's mannered delivery works with
the surreal situations; in HOLLOW REED, Donovan is like a mugging victim
who mutters "Stop, thief."  There is a passion missing from his
interactions with every character in the film which blunts the impact of
his relationship with his son _and_ his relationship with Tom (a more
effective but under-developed Ian Hart).  Pope tries to make up for that
lack of spark by providing a big court-room scene where HOLLOW REED begins
to feel exactly like a TV-movie.  The testimony is treated like a therapy
session where the characters' deep dark feelings are exposed, turning the
climax into a lecture.  Like the least effective TV-movies, HOLLOW REED
starts to feel like it is exists to arouse your indignation rather than to
involve you emotionally.</P>
<P>     If HOLLOW REED is ultimately worthwhile viewing, it is because there
is much more right with the domestic violence story-line than there is
wrong with the gay rights story-line.  Still, the way Pope and writer Paula
Milne approach each issue shows that a timely topic does not a TV-movie
make.  HOLLOW REED is a sensitive study of a particular family responding
in a very personal way to child abuse; it is also a study of Homosexuality
in Society in capital letters.  It's only the latter that you'd probably
see on Fox starring one of the cast members of "Melrose Place."</P>
