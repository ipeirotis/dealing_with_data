<PRE>"What Dreams May Come" - A Heavenly Movie
by Homer Yen
(c) 1998</PRE>
<P>I've always been told that there are two things in life that are
unavoidable - death and taxes. Oddly, I've never given much thought to
either of the two.  Maybe if I did, at least I'd stop getting
collection notices from Uncle Sam.  Yes, let me make a resolution to
devote myself to better record keeping, hold on to all my receipts,
and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are
mistake-free and will keep me from incurring penalties.  It seems that
the issue of death may not be so different, at least envisioned here
in this film.  As this tender love story goes, if you do good things
and have a clear conscience when you die, you ascend to a place of
great peace and beauty.  The dreams, wishes, and fantasies that you
had when you were alive come true.  For those who die with a burdened
soul, however, they wind up in that other place.</P>
<P>Chris and Annie (a winsome Robin Williams and a radiant Annabella
Sciorra) seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has
to offer.  Their love for each other is strong and their bond is
undeniable.  But tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of
Annie's happiness.  And when Chris dies after a terrible car accident,
she commits suicide - a tortured soul who blames herself.   Despair is
perhaps the greatest sin, and she will wallow in her guilt throughout
eternity.  Chris, on the other hand, has made it to heaven, and upon
learning of Annie's fate, he journeys to Hell to find her and to try
to free her from her nightmare.</P>
<P>This film brims with imagination, containing a lush imagery that shows
the arcadia that is Heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that
is Hell.  It seems that Heaven and Hell could very well be a product
of our fantasies or nightmares.  It's shape and look is as infinite as
our imagination.  As Chris explores his new fantastic world and
discovers things both amazing and wondrous, he also begins to learn
more about himself.  Certain questions baffle him at first.  Why does
his home in heaven ooze with paint?  What is the significance of the
Asian stewardess?  Why does he have an all-too-willing guide (Cuba
Gooding, Jr.) to help him find Annie?  But as he slowly begins to
realize the answers, it makes him stronger and gives him a greater
chance to save Annie.</P>
<P>"Dreams" is both visually and tellingly beautiful.  Alas, I have one
regret.  The movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed,
but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying.  It seemed as if it was
racing to some kind of great finish, but its intensity seemed to wane
in its final moments.  However, your eyes will still well up with
tears and you'll find lots to savor.  The storytelling is purposeful
and well constructed.  The journey is imaginative.  And I was
surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.</P>
