<PRE>Scream 2
A film review by Marty Mapes
Copyright 1997 Marty Mapes</PRE>
<P>*** (out of 4) SCREAM 2, like its predecessor, is a genre-crossing film.
It is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery. The mix worked very
well last time and it continues to entertain this time. </P>
<P>SCREAM was also known for its self-referential tone. Many inside jokes
were made in reference to horror movies and Wes Craven. Again, SCREAM 2
follows suit with characters saying such things as "sequels suck" and
"the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels." </P>
<P>SCREAM 2's story is very similar to it's predecessor's. Sidney (Neve
Campbell), having survived the killing spree in SCREAM, is now in
college. Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) has written a book about the
murders and that book is now being released as a feature film, called
STAB (which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie SCREAM).
At the premiere of STAB, two students from Sidney's college are stabbed
to death, and a new story begins. </P>
<P>The press descends on Sidney and her college to get the scoop on this
sequel killer. They want to know all about the links between STAB,
Sidney, and the recent murders. </P>
<P>The most complex self-reference I saw (this should be an Olympic event)
was the scene where Gale Weathers was asking questions at a press
conference. The rest of the press was watching and videotaping Weathers.
The other survivors from SCREAM were watching and videotaping the press.
The audience was watching the whole, filmed scene. (Whew.) </P>
<P>The movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a
pleasure to watch. Even better would be to watch a double feature of
SCREAM and SCREAM 2. That's not to say that these references necessarily
make SCREAM 2 a deep, or even a GOOD movie. The just add to the fun of
watching it. I recommend it for other reasons as well. </P>
<P>What I liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the
monster is not supernatural. No werewolf or ghost or psycho with
superhuman strength is responsible. It is a person in a mask and a robe,
his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims. No
extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer. The down
side is that if you are frightened by horror movies, you have less
grounds to say "it's just a movie." </P>
<P>The whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - Gale
Weathers and Deputy Dewey (David Arquette, also from the original) track
down a killer. They are likeable, but not outstanding. But in
combination with the horror aspect, the whodunit is a perfect
counterpoint. </P>
<P>It was exactly a year ago today that I wrote the review for SCREAM. The
Internet Movie Database says that SCREAM 3 is in the works, so I wonder
if I'll be doing the same thing on January 1, 1999. If Craven and
screenwriter Kevin Williamson are able to keep the quality high, I'll be
happy to mark my calendar.</P>
