<P>        In recent years, there has been a trend in the field of fantasy: 
writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale 
and reclaiming that world, investing it with new life and energy.  In 
modern times, fairy tales have become Disneyfied and debased; they 
have become trite adventures involving leering witches, friendly 
dwarves, and cuddly talking animals.  But in their original forms, 
fairy tales have a dark, wicked edge.  Crows tear out the eyes of 
Cinderella's sisters, a gorier fate then they receive in the animated 
version.  Hansel and Gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven.  
Writers have become fascinated by the bloodier, morally ambivalent 
aspects of fairy tales, and are now modernizing the old stories while 
simultaneously going back to their roots.</P>
<P>        Before this trend was in vogue, Angela Carter--whose stories always 
have a dark, wicked, subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales 
for years.  In THE COMPANY OF WOLVES, she and Neil Jordan retell the 
story of Red Riding Hood, enlivening it with werewolves, Rolls Royces, 
and a visit from Satan. </P>
<P>        The story is structured as a dream, occurring in the mind of Rosaleen 
(Sarah Patterson), an adolescent girl about whose 'real' life we learn 
very little.  Within the dream, there are a number of inset stories, 
most told by dream-Rosaleen's grandmother (Angela Lansbury), and these 
tales gloss the central story in intriguing, suggestive ways.  The 
result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister, 
contemporary fairy tale.</P>
<P>        I say "surprisingly" because there are so many ways this film could 
have gone wrong.  And there are ways in which it does.  The 
performances are mediocre, except for Lansbury's--she finds the right 
note for the prim, apple-cheeked granny, the wise and stern teller of 
cautionary tales.  The soundtrack, synth-heavy, reminded me of bad 80s 
horror movies, as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes.  
Probably state-of-the-art at the time, they are now laughable.</P>
<P>        But Jordan succeeds at what I consider the trickiest aspect of the 
film: he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense 
of the fantastic, of otherness.  One of the problems in adapting 
full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the 
imagination of the reader, rather than being subjected to the 
'realism' of the screen.  Part of me would love to see an adaptation 
of 'The Lord of the Rings,' but, on the other hand, I know that any 
filmmaker's recreation of ents, hobbits, and balrogs is inevitably 
going to be really lame compared to what I picture in my mind.</P>
<P>        This makes Jordan's accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me: 
he imbues THE COMPANY OF WOLVES with a genuine sense of magic and 
mystery.  The somewhat Ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of 
ur-reality.  The sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant.  The 
nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly.  The peasant village 
is rustic and cozy, the woods old and hoary.</P>
<P>        This archetypal realm is the setting for a smart, subtle, literate 
script, a script which is as good as you'd expect from Jordan (himself 
an accomplished fiction writer) and Carter.  For Carter, the cauldron 
of story is a witches' brew, bubbling over with primal ingredients: 
mist-shrouded forests, ancient graveyards, virginal girls and wise 
women, wolves with glowing eyes.  She adeptly blends them all 
together.  There is a symbolic richness to the film; everything is 
permeated with a sense of significance.</P>
<P>        The point of it all, I think, is to represent a girl's 
rites-of-passage on an unconscious, primordial level.  A night-journey 
through the forest, from the village to the grandmother's home, is the 
crux of THE COMPANY OF WOLVES.  "Don't stray from the path," Rosaleen 
is told, again and again, and the path is both literal and figurative: 
the path through the forest and the path of life.   Staying on the 
path is the conventional approach suggested by Rosaleen's elders.  
Carter and Jordan, never conventional, explore what goes on when you 
leave the path.</P>
<P>        Those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate.  This fate is 
literalized in the dream as werewolves, but the werewolves connote 
many things: death, sex, knowledge.  If straying from the path leads 
to death, then it's not a good idea--but if that's what you have to 
risk to get sex and knowledge (and therefore power), then maybe it's 
worth the risk.  When you leave the path, the world becomes a 
dangerous, ambiguous place, but it's full of potential.  And it's 
certainly more interesting than the Disney version.</P>
