<PRE>THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>Tammy Faye Bakker, "the First Lady of Christian broadcasting," was at
the center of the biggest real-life soap opera of the 1980s.  THE EYES
OF TAMMY FAYE, directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato and narrated
by none other than RuPaul Charles, is a mesmerizing and insightful look
into her life and the whole PTL (Praise The Lord) network scandal
involving her husband, Jim Bakker.</P>
<P>The documentary argues convincingly that the only sin of Tammy Faye, a
likeable little dynamo, is her unquestioning naiveté.  It suggests that
her husband's problems come down not to greed but to mismanagement and
that his infamous one-night stand with a playboy centerfold represents a
momentary lapse in judgment.  The villain of the piece turns out to be
Jerry Falwell.  Whether this represents the ultimate truth or not may
never be known, but the documentary offers compelling evidence to
support its case.</P>
<P>All of the above notwithstanding, the reason to see the movie is to meet
a fascinating and resourceful woman with a very interesting background.
Although the title refers to Tammy's signature heavy eye make-up, it
could be titled THE EYES OF THE VIEWERS since your eyes will be glued to
the screen in this intriguing tale.  In an age in which reality
programming is popular, this movie would seem to have arrived at just
the right moment in time.  Forget daytime soaps, none could be better
than this movie.</P>
<P>Each of the story's chapters is introduced by puppets who like to giggle
as they read titles like "Things Can Only Get Worse."  These humorous
puppets are appropriate since Jim and Tammy's first television show was
a Christian broadcast done Howdy Doody style.  Tammy Faye, like a little
girl who never grew up, loves her dolls and puppets even today.  The
remarkably good-spirited documentary offers up lots of opportunities to
laugh but none are at Tammy Faye's expense.</P>
<P>After the Christian kids' show, Jim and Tammy went on to form the famous
700 Club and their own network.  Intrigue followed them wherever they
went, and, like all of the major televangelists, they lived a lavish
lifestyle.  The internecine warfare among the leaders of the Christian
broadcasting community is shown to be much more vicious than outsiders
would ever imagine.</P>
<P>An unabashed believer in the importance of happiness in worship ("We
believe that we were one of the first people to put fun and joy in
religion."), she works so hard that she appears in constant danger of a
complete meltdown.  Overuse of prescription drugs proves to be her
undoing.</P>
<P>Meanwhile her husband, Jim, is busy launching a satellite and building
the third biggest recreational attraction in America, the Heritage USA
theme park.  All along, he is blasting across the airways trying to
raise money while harping on his theme of "God loves you, he really
does."  If he isn't shown to be quite as likeable as Tammy Faye, Jim
still comes across as an ambitious man with a good heart who made some
mistakes.  In short, he just appears human, and high profile political
figures guilty of much more than he have thrived.</P>
<P>Most of all, Tammy Faye is a survivor.  Jim J. Bullock, a gay comedian
and, at one time, Tammy's television talk-show host, says it best about
Tammy Faye's skills.  "After the Holocaust, there will be roaches, Tammy
Faye and Cher," he gives as his list of the top survivors of the
twentieth century.</P>
<P>THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE runs a fast 1:19.  It is rated PG-13 for some
sexual content and would be acceptable for any kids old enough to be
interested in the material.</P>
