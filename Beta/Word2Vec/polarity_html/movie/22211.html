<PRE>Daylight
A review by Joe Chamberlain</PRE>
<P>Starring Sylvester Stallone; Amy Brenneman; Viggo Mortensen; Dan Hedaya &
Jay O. Sanders</P>
<P>At first glance, Daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie. On
second glance it looks that way too. Although, as typical disaster movies
go, Daylight isn't that bad. Admittedly, it seems to rip off a great deal of
its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by (think Poseidon
Adventure). But the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for
the "haven't I seen this scene somewhere before?" feeling that creeps up all
too often during the film.</P>
<P>Sylvester Stallone stars as the recently fired head of New York's Emergency
Response team. By sheer luck, he is in the right place at the right time
when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film. "What
disaster is that?" you ask, as you inch ever closer to the edge of your
seat. Glad you asked. Through a whole sequence of entirely probable events
(about as probable as hitting the lottery) a large explosion takes place in
the Lincoln tunnel running under the Hudson River in New York City. The
explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends, which causes not
only massive loss of life, but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of
the tunnel. Good old Sly, who is only feet away from entering the tunnel
when it collapses, offers his services to the rescuers, who gladly accept
it. Sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft (think Judge Dredd)
which he can only go in, and not out off, and proceeds to try to rescue
those trapped inside. So begins the fun, but the fun has to be quick,
because this tunnel has started to spring a leak.</P>
<P>The acting is about what you would expect of a Stallone movie. Not superb by
any means, but far above some of his other films (think Judge Dredd again).
Daylight's acting is probably average, or a little above, in terms of this
sort of genre, starring this particular star. Amy Brenneman is the only
actor of any note, and she does a pretty good job as Stallone's reluctant
helper. Oh yeah, Stallone's real life son, Sage, is in this too. Sage --
nice name. I guess it could be worse, he could have been named nutmeg or
parsley. Note to Sage -- you are still young. Go to school and get a good
education -- you don't have a future in acting.</P>
<P>The plot runs along the same lines as the acting -- interesting, but
predictable. Mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a
dozen other action flicks. The biggest problem with a film of this nature is
that they try to cram too many things into the movie. As soon as the cast
clears one seemingly impossible hurdle, another one seems to pop right up,
even worse than the last one. I realize that it wouldn't be much of a movie
otherwise, but it does make the movie a bit predictable. Adding to the
predictability is the cast of characters, which of course, has to include at
least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and
think the qualified guy (in this case Stallone) doesn't know what he is
doing. Why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with
each other and all work together? Would this be too much to ask? Can't we
all just get along?</P>
<P>Special effects weren't bad -- but I've certainly seen better. Some of the
scenes, while fun to watch, were such blatant rip-offs that you had to
wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim. Especially all
of the scenes that involved anything underwater (the tunnel, of course,
starts to flood). I really expected Gene Hackman, Roddy McDowell and Ernest
Borgnine to appear at any minute -- I wasn't sure if I was watching Daylight
or The Poseidon Adventure. I suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good
ideas, The Poseidon Adventure is a good one to use. The underwater sequences
(aside from the deja vu) were very well shot and worked fairly well. They
were the best part of the movie by a long shot.</P>
<P>Better than average Stallone flick. I realize that's not saying much when
the man has Judge Dredd on his resume. But certainly not up to the standards
of Cliffhanger. Daylight is a fun movie, and as long as you aren't expecting
a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised.</P>
