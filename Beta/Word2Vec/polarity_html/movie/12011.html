<P>My Giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a
distinctive `Princess Bride,' medieval fairy-tale-in-the-‘90s feel.  I
was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was, with very funny
scenes occurring on a movie set in Romania where talent agent Sammy
(Billy Crystal) is visiting a client and in the monastery where Sammy
ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his
car into a stream.  And when Sammy meets Max, his giant, mysterious
savior played by Gheorghe Muresan, there is magic in the air; albeit it
a bit goofy, I loved every minute of it.  The film, of course, plays on
the size difference between the two, and at times you would almost swear
it must be special effects.  I particularly enjoyed a shot of Sammy
dangling his legs from a Max-sized chair as the two face each over an
enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons.  I also liked
Jere Burns' (from TV's `Something So Right') performance as the director
of the film in Romania.</P>
<P>At this point, the primary flaw in the film is that Gheorghe Muresan is
incredibly hard to understand, particularly during his fast-paced first
scene.  It is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly
right out of the gate, as I did understand him more as the film
continued and I became accustomed to his speech.  However, about the
time Muresan becomes coherent, the characters head to New York and the
film takes a dive.  Off the high board.</P>
<P>Suddenly, we are expected to believe Sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes
slime ball.  Up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be
sure, but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk.  If he had, the first
scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical.  But now, in
New York, we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son, and
his character is desperate enough to involve Max in a disturbing giant
vs. midgets wrestling match, which I found quite unpleasant and jarring
within the framework of the film.  Indeed, many scenes stuck out of this
film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces.  
This includes the scenes featuring Steven Seagal, when Sammy gets Max a
role in a big, Hollywood movie filming in Las Vegas.  While I enjoyed
seeing Seagal poke fun at himself, the scenes appeared to exist solely
because of his participation, rather than because the film demanded it. 
And the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that Max
would win the role based on his quotations of Shakespeare.  At this
point I found myself thinking, `We're supposed to believe that someone
would cast this guy in a film?'  Then I realized he was, and I was
watching it.</P>
<P>In the final third, the film undergoes another transformation, this time
to unbridled sentimentality.  Note:  Major plot points are revealed in
this and the final paragraph. Max went to America because Sammy promised
to reunited him with his childhood love, Lillianna, who hasn't seen him
since he was a normal-sized kid.  Her refusal to see Max (unbeknownst to
him) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as Sammy's
wife Serena, played nicely by Kathleen Quinlan, poses as Lillianna.  I
found this scene offensive.  Not only did it rely on deception to induce
warm, fuzzy feelings from the audience, it reduced Max to someone we
should pity and coddle, which I thought was quite undeserved.  I think
Max could have handled the truth, gratuitous illness and all.  Late in
the film we learn Max, and in fact all giants, have a heart condition
which shortens their lives considerably.  This could be an enlightening
revelation, but the film seemingly presents it only to justify Sammy's
transformation into a caring, sensitive guy -- and hey, a great dad and
husband, too!</P>
<P>`My Giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped
characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their
own internal persuasions.  A stronger story with more room for character
growth might have been possible if the focus was on Max's struggle to be
accepted and cast in movies instead of Sammy's struggles to get money
and become a better person.  In this scenario, Max's illness could have
been a integral part of the film not a story motivator.  Sentiment and
emotion would have followed naturally.  Instead, we're apparently not
supposed to like Sammy until the end, but we're not allowed to focus on
Max.  Crystal and Muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable
performances, but in the end, `My Giant' left me feeling like I'd been
fed gruel from a giant spoon.</P>
