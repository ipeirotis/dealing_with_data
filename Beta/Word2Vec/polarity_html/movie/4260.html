<P>     Born in the late 19th century, legendary French surrealist Antonin
Artaud made a lasting impact on the theatrical and poetry communities
during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s.  Artaud's "Theater of Cruelty"--an
experimental form of stage performance that encouraged actors to
liberate their subconsciouses--influenced Genet, Ionesco, and
Beckett's "Theater of the Absurd".  Throughout his turbulent life,
Artaud was plagued by bouts of extreme depression, heavy drug use, and
frequent stays in asylums.  MY LIFE AND TIMES WITH ANTONIN ARTAUD takes
a look at the last few years of the artist's life (he died on March 4,
1948) through the eyes of his fictional drug dealer, Jacques Prevel.</P>
<P>     Given the chaotic richness of Artaud's lifestyle, one would expect
a gripping tale.  Instead, what writer/director Gerard Mordillat has
filmed is a terminally-dull, pretentious look at one man's private
demons.  As portrayed by Sami Frey, Artaud is a raving lunatic who
continually spouts bizarre theories.  Sex, in his opinion, has become
impure and must be avoided lest it sap the spirit.  There are seven to
eight million human beings who need to be annihilated.  A fly is the
trigger of someone's evil thoughts.  And so on... This sort of weirdness
is all we get from Artaud; if there's a man beneath the mysticism, he
never surfaces.</P>
<P>     Prevel (Marc Barbe) is an amateur poet and Artaud worshipper who
supplies his hero with drugs while juggling his own unstable personal
life.  He has a pregnant wife (Valerie Jeannet) who doesn't like Artaud
and a pill-popping mistress (Julie Jezequel), whom Artaud names as one
of the millions in need of annihilation.  Prevel's relationship with
these two women is by far the picture's most interesting aspect, but,
through lack of screen time, it's limited to an underdeveloped subplot.
Instead, what we get for most of the ninety-three minute movie is
interaction between Artaud and Prevel--dull conversations in a
"friendship" that never grows beyond an embryonic state.</P>
<P>     Although ostensibly a period piece with black-and-white photography
designed to bolster the atmosphere, MY LIFE AND TIMES WITH ANTONIN
ARTAUD is so anachronism-saturated that this has to be intentional.  The
most obvious example can be seen when modern-day cars zip around the
streets of Paris.  There's probably some deeply artistic reason for such
an obvious disregard for "reality", but, whatever it is, it eludes me.
Suffice it to say, it jars the viewer out of the film's reality to see a
'90s vehicle when it's supposed to be 1947.</P>
<P>     The sole bright spot in MY LIFE AND TIMES is the performance of
Sami Frey, who is amazingly intense as the title character.  He goes
through several scenes with his eyes fixed unblinkingly on some unseen
object while he delivers his dialogue seemingly on the verge of
hysteria.  Next to Frey, Marc Barbe's Prevel is flat.  The supporting
performers are merely adequate.</P>
<P>     Through the years, the struggles of the tortured artist have been
at the core of films as far ranging as VINCENT AND THEO and THE DOORS.
MY LIFE AND TIMES WITH ANTONIN ARTAUD is one of the least successful of
the subgenre.  Comparisons to the recent, similarly-themed TOTAL ECLIPSE
are entirely appropriate.  While Agnieszka Holland's picture took us
deep into the life and psyche of Arthur Rimbaud, Mordillat's movie
stands aloof, never letting us close to the principals.  The result is
an apathy regarding Artaud and Prevel that leads to a nearly
overpowering desire to take a nap.</P>
