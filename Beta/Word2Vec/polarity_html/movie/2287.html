                       A film review by Michael S. Huang
                        Copyright 1993 Michael S. Huang</PRE>

<PRE>Rating (0 to 10): 8.5</PRE>
<P>     One year has passed since the last time we saw them, and but Wayne
Campbell and Garth Algar are back but, they've moved out of their
parents homes, and now have their own pad in an abandoned warehouse.
Wayne's still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend, Cassandra, and
of course Garth is still having his own, personal growing pains.</P>
<P>     They guys are just finishing off one of their shows, and head off
to an Aerosmith concert where they run across Cassandra and her new
manager, a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character Rob
Lowe portrayed in the previous film.</P>
<P>     Again, the promoter is not only after the money that Cassandra's
talent can bring in.  The storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of
the original, "guy loses chick, guy realizes mistake, and guy gets
chick back."</P>
<P>     Fortunately, there is more to this movie than this somewhat sheer
plot.  The wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and
fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well
as just a lot of hilarious scenes of Wayne and Garth showing their true
color.</P>
<P>     Highlights of the movie include a spoof of JURASSIC PARK, Garth's
seduction by a married woman, a surprise appearance by Charleton
Heston, a 1960's Batman setup in the guy's pad, and some pretty groovy
chats with Jim Morrison and some "naked Indian guy," an unexpected
lip-sync of YMCA (you could see that one coming a mile away) and of
course a hilarious parody of those badly-dubbed kung-fu movies we love
to laugh at.</P>
<P>     And if you've ever wondered why there's always boxes of
watermelons, chickens, and people walking plate glass in the middle of
streets, you'll find out here.</P>
<P>     This movie also explores Wayne and Garth a little more.  Garth has
somewhat of a "coming of age" and Wayne gets to learn a little about
himself (with a little help from our old friend, Jim Morrison).  A few
old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again, but this
time with a few twists to keep them fresh, and luckily, few, if any of
them are overused.</P>
<P>     Overall, the movie has plenty of continuity flaws (especially in
the fight scent between Garth and Cassandra's dad), but these are
easily overlooked as this is, after Wayne's World.  The plot is flimsy
but manageable.  There are a few special effects, but they are fairly
seamless, and fill nicely into the plot.  The acting is good, for this
sort of movie, but there are some very bright spots.</P>
<P>     In the big picture, this movie is just plain fun.  There is lots
of intelligent humor that makes this film special.  During the whole
one hour and 40 minutes, I didn't even think about looking at my watch
a single time.  Silly, but riotous at times, this is an excellent movie
even better than the original.</P>
