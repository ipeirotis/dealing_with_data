<PRE>BOWFINGER
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>"We're trying to make a movie here, not a film," explains Bobby
Bowfinger (Steve Martin), head of Bowfinger International Pictures.
Bobby, whose recent films include THE YUGO STORY, is a no nonsense
filmmaker.  In possession now of a great script by his accountant and
part-time receptionist, Bobby has only one problem.  In order to turn
the script -- CHUBBY RAIN, about aliens falling to earth in fat
raindrops -- into a "go picture," he just needs famous action hero Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to star in it.</P>
<P>Superstar Kit doesn't give small-potatoes producer Bobby the time of
day, forcing Bobby to improvise.  He will resort to guerilla filmmaking
techniques and shoot Kit's scenes from hidden cameras.  Kit will never
know he's in the movie, and most of CHUBBY RAIN's cast and crew don't
know that Kit doesn't know.  ("Did you know that Tom Cruise had no idea
he was in that vampire movie until two years later?" Bobby tells his
cameraman.)</P>
<P>The inventive and resourceful Bobby has an answer for every problem.
Need some lighting for a shot?  Just have a guy on the street hold a
reflective "Work for Food" sign and use the sun to illuminate Kit's
face.</P>
<P>Frank Oz, who gave us the riotously funny IN AND OUT (one of the best
movies of 1997), directs BOWFINGER with near perfection.  As they did in
DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, Oz and Martin form a great team.  Together with
Murphy and a scene-stealing Heather Graham (AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO
SHAGGED ME), the cast and crew of BOWFINGER are as wonderful as those in
CHUBBY RAIN are humorously appalling.</P>
<P>Steve Martin's script is a classic bit of comedic writing with a long
list of memorable lines.  The most amazing part of the script is that it
gets laughs the old-fashioned way without benefit of flatulence jokes,
bathroom humor or bodily fluids.</P>
<P>The movie deliciously skewers Tinseltown.  Bobby reveals such secrets as
the fact that every movie costs exactly $2,184 -- which is what he has
saved away.  Everything above that sum is overhead in the forms of gross
points, mark-ups, etc.  With this sum he hires "the best damn crew we
can afford," which means they go to the border and collect some free
illegal aliens.</P>
<P>In the story's best subplot, Daisy (Graham) plays a would-be starlet
from the Midwest who's given herself one week to hit it big in
movieland.  She's a fast learner.  "I may be from Ohio," she explains.
"But, I'm not from Ohio."  She realizes quickly the tried and true
method for a young actress to advance her career overnight -- figuring
out the right people to sleep with.  Daisy's so bright and fast, that
she flits from partner to partner, rapidly moving up the food chain.
Graham, with her pixyish grin and her girl-next-door sexuality is the
perfect choice for the role.  She takes what could be a slightly sleazy
part and turns it into a sweet and charming one instead.  "Who cares if
when I reach my sexual peak, you'll be 70," Daisy tells Bobby with
sincere conviction as they frolic in bed.</P>
<P>Murphy shows an acting dexterity and a risk-taking openness that's
impressive.  As Kit, he dares to be unsure of himself and completely
paranoid.  As Jiff, a shy guy who would be happy to work his way up to
gofer, Murphy, with bad teeth and braces, plays a second part.  When
they can't find Kit for a while, Jiff is hired to film some of Kit's
scenes.  Jiff blushes or cries, not as an act, but because he's
embarrassed or scared.</P>
<P>In Jiff's interview, Bobby probes whether Jiff would be willing to alter
his appearance in order to look like Kit.  "Would you be willing to cut
your hair?" Bobby probes.  "Yes, but it's usually better if someone else
does it," Jiff replies sincerely, missing the point of the question
entirely.  He does have movie experience; he says that he's a frequent
renter at Blockbuster.</P>
<P>Another subplot pokes fun at stars' fascination with Scientology, called
Mind Head in the movie and led by an ethereal Terry Stricter (Terence
Stamp, Chancellor Valorum from STAR WARS: EPISODE I).  As CHUBBY RAIN's
actors keep coming up to him talking about aliens, Kit becomes neurotic
and unbalanced.  Kit flees to his guru, Terry, who peppers him with
aphorisms.  Kit should mean "Keep It Together," Kit repeats to himself
with little confidence.  After volumes of useless pop advice, Terry
eventually realizes what's happening to Kit.  "It seems the paranoid
sometimes are actually being followed," Terry concludes.</P>
<P>As the movie advances towards a climax worthy of CHARIOTS OF FIRE, the
energetic pacing reaches fever pitch.  In a sort of epilogue, we get to
glimpse Bobby's next movie, which is so outrageously bad that an
uncontrollable fit of laughter is the most likely response.  BOWFINGER
and both of the movies within it are thoroughly satisfying.  Even if
they charged you for all three, it would be worth the triple admission
price.</P>
<P>BOWFINGER runs 1:37.  It is rated PG-13 for sex-related material and
language and would be fine for kids 10 and up.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, thought the movie was hilarious and gave it a
full ****.  His favorite part was the high-spirited ending.</P>
