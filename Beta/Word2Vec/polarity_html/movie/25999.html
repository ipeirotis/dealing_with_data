CRIMINAL LOVERS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>"Isn't it exciting?" the lithe and beautiful Alice (Natacha Régnier from 
THE DREAMLIFE OF ANGELS) asks her virginal boyfriend, Luc (Jérémie 
Renier).  "Our adventure.  You used to complain that nothing happened."  
Loading the body of a high school classmate, Saïd (Salim Kechiouche), 
whom they just murdered into the trunk of the car, the numb Luc isn't 
likely to be griping about the lack of excitement ever again.</P>
<P>Writer/director François Ozon's CRIMINAL LOVERS (LES AMANTS CRIMINELS) 
is a dark, dark psychosexual fairy tale for adults as written by the 
Brothers Grimm, as in VERY grim.  It is an erotically-charged morality 
tale with the message that actions have consequences and horrific 
actions have horrific consequences.  </P>
<P>At first, we aren't sure why these two young lovers have killed Saïd.  
Is it just for sadomasochistic sexual gratification as it certainly 
seems?  Using flashbacks, we learn from Alice the reason why she feels 
that she deserves to enact revenge on Saïd, but how credible is her 
version of the truth?  And will we ever come to know the exact events 
that led her to take another's life with such premeditated viciousness?</P>
<P>After asking the shocked Luc if he loves her and getting no response, 
Alice goes off with Luc to bury Saïd's body in the woods.  Along the way 
they stick up a jewelry store, but Alice wishes they had held up the 
bakery instead since she's hungry.  This is a girl with a very twisted 
sense of morality.  She cries profusely for a rabbit that they run over 
but has no sense of remorse over slicing up a human being like a piece 
of meat.  What is clear is that she gets her sexual kicks from perverse 
activities.  </P>
<P>Filmed beautifully and scored well musically, the picture alternately 
invites and repulses us.  The most sickening scene turns out to be the 
skinning of a rabbit, as its flesh is ripped off its body.  It is the 
type of movie that, the more you describe it, the more your readers want 
no part of it.  But this is a fascinating film with chillingly 
believable acting.  And with plenty of surprises along the way.</P>
<P>The second part of the story happens after our young lovers have buried 
Saïd's body.  Lost in the woods, they happen upon the remote cabin of an 
ogre.  They figure that they are quite invincible and can easily rob 
food from him.</P>
<P>Instead, this man, listed in the credits only as the man in the forest 
(Miki Manojlovic), proves to be a one-man vigilante squad.  He throws 
them down into a dark basement inhabited by rats and Saïd's decomposing 
body, which the man has unburied.  The man says he has cannibalistic 
intents on them, liking his girls skinny and his boys fat.  This means 
that Luc gets stuffed like a goose while Alice starves.  Homosexual rape 
is just one of many terrors that he inflicts on his prisoners.  Suffice 
it to say that they would have been much better off if the police had 
found them first.</P>
<P>If ever there was a movie that isn't for everyone, it's CRIMINAL LOVERS.  
But if you find really dark sexual thrillers intriguing, CRIMINAL LOVERS 
may be the picture for you since they don't get much darker or more 
erotic than this.</P>
<P>CRIMINAL LOVERS runs 1:30.  It is in French with English subtitles.  The 
film is not rated but would probably be NC-17 for nudity, language and 
strong sexuality and violence, including rape.  It is for adults only.</P>
