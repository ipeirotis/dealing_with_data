<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A film that means well, but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and
too sentimental to be compelling as a drama. It's Jeroen Krabbé's melodrama
about a community of Jews in Antwerp in 1972 who can't forget their bitter past.
The heroine is an attractive, carefree, nonreligious 20-year-old, Chaja
(Fraser), who wants to forget her Jewish roots by getting involved in student
demonstrations, screwing a student rebel leader, and living with her Gentile
friends away from her nagging mother (Sägebrecht) and her self-absorbed,
eccentric father (Schell). Her parents are survivors of the Holocaust
concentration camps, and her home life is filled with angst. Her mother is in
denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes
and complaining about everything, while her father is more openly loving but has
recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos, a
family album, silverware, and his old violin. He buried them in a garden during
the war while fleeing the Nazis, but can't locate them now due to all the
changes in the city. </P>
<P>Out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction
from her apartment, she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an Hasidic
couple that an old man in her parents' apartment building, Mr. Apfelschnitt
(Topol), tells her about. The Hasidics are ultra-orthodox: they don't go to the
cinema or watch TV, adhere to strict dress codes, and strictly observe their
religious laws. </P>
<P>Chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules, but
soon finds the wife, Mrs. Kalman (Rossellini), to be kind and she becomes
attached to one of her 5 children, a 4-year-old named Simcha (Monty) who doesn't
talk. The stern Mr. Kalman (Krabbé) is not friendly to her and considers her to
be a whore because of the way she dresses. </P>
<P>To hammer home the point of how anti-Semitism hasn't gone away there's a barrage
of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering Concierge (Bradley), who
keeps making nasty remarks about Jews and tries to make things inconvenient for
them by preventing the Jewish family from using the elevator. </P>
<P>The film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story, adapted from Carl
Friedman's book "The Shovel And The Loom," goes from one false note to another
until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality. It starts off telling
Chaja's story of how she's a lost Jewess trying to find her identity, then to
her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment, and
then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that
can't be forgotten. The effort seemed heavy-handed, as the film kept delivering
too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock
characters. </P>
<P>The supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a
cartoonish flavoring: Chaja's parents are given no human shades, while the
janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and
falsely acted. </P>
<P>The only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were
Fraser, whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was
going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could
be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots; while Rossellini
gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence, but is strong in
accepting her faith. Topol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all
the right things to Fraser, acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in
explaining all the sufferings with common sense. </P>
<P>The film brazenly uses little Simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out
how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can't love: it starts out by
showing how under Chaja's loving care he's taken to the duck pond and soon
starts jabbering away, beginning by saying 'quack, quack' and then going on to
ask the four questions during a Passover seder. But by showing how the boy is so
terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence, refuses
to speak because of his stern dad, and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic
accident, the film thereby exploits the boy's sufferings and his story just
becomes tiresome and not sincerely done. </P>
<P>I felt I didn't just see a movie, but I attended a lecture for the whole 100
minutes of this serious but unappetizing story. It was the kind of movie that
you hoped would somehow end soon, as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing
its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already
received. In the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for
the lost luggage, one has the impression that no one in the film learned
anything about themselves or the past. That seems strange, since I thought that
was what this film was supposed to be about. Unless I was mistaken and the
film's real aim was to make us cry over Simcha. </P>
