<P>     Despite a reasonably original story line, familiar characters,
first rate special effects, and the hallmark meeting between Captains
Kirk (William Shatner) and Picard (Patrick Stewart), there's something
fundamentally dissatisfying about this, the seventh "Star Trek" feature
film.  The problem is that while STAR TREK: GENERATIONS is undeniably a
major motion picture, too often it seems like little more than an
over-budgeted, double-length episode of the "Next Generation"
television series.  The vestiges of the intangible "Star Trek" magic
which has survived for more than twenty-five years, and weathered six
feature films (the last two of which have been lackluster), are laid to
rest here.  If the spirit of the series is ever again to boldly go, it
will have to rise, phoenix-like, from the ashes.</P>
<P>     STAR TREK: GENERATIONS opens in the twenty third century with the
christening of the USS Enterprise "B".  On hand for the event are three
living legends:  Captain James T. Kirk, Captain Montgomery Scott (James
Doohan), and Commander Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig).  As so often
happens in the "Star Trek" universe, a ceremonial maiden voyage turns
into a rescue mission, with the Enterprise the only ship within range
to aid refugees trapped by a mysterious--and deadly--energy ribbon.
Kirk, assisted by his two old friends, manages to save nearly fifty
lives, but not before the section of the ship where he's working is
destroyed.  No body is found, but the celebrated Starfleet officer is
presumed dead.  In actuality, however, he has been sucked into the
"Nexus", a place where time has no meaning and where fantasies become
reality.</P>
<P>     Seventy-eight years later, the crew of the Enterprise "D" are
engaged in a rescue mission of their own: saving scientists in an
observatory ravaged by a Romulan attack.  One of the survivors, a
Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), is a long-lived alien who exhibits
certain irrational tendencies.  Driven by an obsessive need to enter
the "Nexus", and willing to take any action necessary to accomplish
that aim, Soran turns against Captain Picard, placing in jeopardy not
only the Enterprise "D", but an entire populated planet.</P>
<P>     It's difficult to say how the general public will react to this
film.  Unlike the previous sequels, GENERATIONS is largely inaccessible
to non-"Trek" aficionados.  However, with its focus on character
development over action, it should prove enjoyable for those
well-acquainted with the voyages of any Enterprise.  One of
GENERATIONS' strengths is its willingness to take chances with the
familiar "Star Trek" mythos.  This movie spends as much time tearing
down old bridges as building new ones.</P>
<P>     There are problems, however, several of which are too obvious to
ignore.  First time feature director David Carson's inexperience is at
times evident.  His film is inconsistently paced, with a few space
battle/action scenes sprinkled liberally throughout an otherwise talky,
protracted story.  A combat sequence between the USS Enterprise "D" and
a Klingon ship lacks any semblance of tension.  Looking back at the
ship-to-ship duels of movies 2, 3, and 6, there was a flair and
buildup that is noticeably absent here.  The battles in GENERATIONS are
hurried, and the viewer appears to be watching rather than
participating, with little opportunity to savor the moment.</P>
<P>     Equally unimpressive is Carson's handling of a certain
highly-emotional moment that figures prominently in the climax.  Again,
perhaps he's rushing things, but those of us in the audience recognize
that the scene should be far more affecting than it actually is.  The
ending of STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN, which featured Spock's
death, was wrenching.  By comparison, GENERATIONS' last moments are
flat.</P>
<P>     Malcolm McDowell plays the latest--and probably the weakest--"Star
Trek" film villain.  Following in the footsteps of Ricardo Montalban's
Khan, Christopher Lloyd's Kruge, and Christopher Plummer's Chang,
McDowell can't quite live up to the scenery-chewing nastiness of his
predecessors.  This is precisely because McDowell's Soran is too
restrained--"Trek" bad guys tend to be at their best when hamming it
up.</P>
<P>     The centerpiece of GENERATIONS is the much-anticipated meeting
between Kirk and Picard, which completes the old crew-to-new crew
transition begun in STAR TREK VI.  Shatner wears Kirk like a
comfortable garment, and somehow the film seems more alive when he's on
screen.  Stewart, the consummate professional, is undeniably the better
actor, but his presence isn't as arresting.  Even Brent Spiner, despite
a wonderful, often-comic performance as Lt. Commander Data, can't fill
the gap left when Kirk isn't around.</P>
<P>     One thing made obvious by this picture is that the "Star Trek"
movies are in desperate need of musical continuity.  Dennis McCarthy is
the fifth composer in seven films, and his score is perhaps the most
bland of all.  Except during certain key moments when the Alexander
Courage signature tune is used, most of GENERATIONS' unmemorable music
fades into the dimly-lit background.</P>
<P>     Lovers of frantically-paced science fiction may find GENERATIONS
too static, and fans of the original series will likely be disappointed
by the limited screen time accorded Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov (not to
mention the absence of Spock, Bones, Sulu, and Uhura) Mostly,
GENERATIONS spends its running length searching for--and never
completely finding--its niche.</P>
<P>     If there is an eighth "Star Trek" film, and GENERATIONS isn't the
series' epitaph, perhaps eliminating the burden of mixing characters
from different eras will permit a less-erratic plot line.  Either way,
however, "Star Trek" will never be the same.  Age and a few too many
bad stories may have robbed Kirk and company of their vitality, but
nothing can take away their mystique--and that is the quality which
will sorely be missed.</P>
