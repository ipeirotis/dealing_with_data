<PRE>                                KISS OF DEATH
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  David Caruso, Nicolas Cage, Samuel L. Jackson,
           Stanley Tucci, Michael Rapaport, Helen Hunt, Kathryn Erbe,
           Ving Rhames.
Screenplay:  Richard Price.
Director:  Barbet Schroeder.</P>
<P>     To answer the most obvious question first: no, David Caruso's
naked posterior does not appear in KISS OF DEATH, although it might
have been appropriate.  After one highly-publicized season on "NYPD
Blue" which included even-more-highly-publicized dorsal nudity,
Caruso left the series in a yet-more-highly-publicized squabble over
salary and time off to make movies, which had fellow cast members
suggesting that he not let the door hit his bare backside on the way
out.  Caruso's first opportunity for an "I told you so" comes in
KISS OF DEATH, but he might be advised to postpone any self-
congratulation.  In a film that is erratic but frequently intense,
his casting in the lead role is the most glaring flaw.</P>
<P>     Caruso plays Jimmy Kilmartin, a car thief trying to straighten
out his life after a stint in prison.  Unfortunately, he is pulled
back into another job by his bad-news cousin Ronnie (Michael
Rapaport), a job that goes bad and lands Jimmy back in prison.
While inside he agrees to become a state's witness for District
Attorney Frank Zioli (Stanley Tucci), but the one deal Jimmy makes
isn't good enough for Zioli.  As Jimmy comes up for parole, he is
pressured into going undercover into the crime organization run by
Little Junior Brown (Nicolas Cage), a psycho with a very short fuse.
Caught between Little Junior, Zioli and a cop with a score to settle
(Samuel L. Jackson), Jimmy realizes that his only way out is to take
matters into his own hands.</P>
<P>     The screenplay for KISS OF DEATH, written by Richard Price
based on a 1947 film noir of the same name, is a dense piece of
plotting, but an extremely confident one.  Like a novel, KISS OF
DEATH unfolds in well-developed pieces, building towards a solid
conclusion with very little extraneous material.  The plot's twists
are both relevant and unexpected, and director Barbet Schroeder
keeps a steady hand on the pace.  Yet somehow, in the middle of all
the clockwork plotting, gaping flaws in logic and flat-out
sloppiness appear.  In one sequence, Kilmartin's family is supposed
to be under police protection, but his daughter is allowed to play
on a swing along what is apparently a main thoroughfare with only
one guard, while earlier two agents with high-powered rifles stood
watch while she played near a secluded cliffside.  Then, near the
end of the film, one of the big payoff revelations is spoiled by an
unnecessary establishing shot.  It sometimes seems that Schroeder is
so busy painting the trim on the house that is KISS OF DEATH that he
fails to notice it's missing a wall.</P>
<P>     It's a good thing that so many of the people in that house are
so interesting.  Samuel L. Jackson turns in one of his now-routine
dynamite supporting turns as Calvin, the wounded cop who develops an
unexpected connection with Jimmy.  He is mis-used in the conclusion
for a gimmicky applause moment, but otherwise turns in stellar work.
Michael Rapaport, still growing his hair out from his role as the
skinhead in HIGHER LEARNING, is fantastic as the sleazy Ronnie right
through to his brutal comeuppance, as is Anthony Heald in a small
role as Little Junior's slick and savvy attorney.  Add Stanley
Tucci's duplicitous D. A. and Helen Hunt as Jimmy's recovering
alcoholic wife, and you have one of the best supporting casts since
PULP FICTION.</P>
<P>     Unlike PULP FICTION, however, the lead performances are not of
the same caliber.  Nicolas Cage is an actor who has shown the
ability to play everything from romantic leads to villains, but
there is no center to Little Junior.  One second he is brutal but
shrewd; the next he is simply off his nut.  As for Caruso, he is
given a role that would be a challenge to make sympathetic by an
actor with much greater range.  Caruso is unable to give Jimmy any
humanity, delivering every line in the same hushed,
primed-to-explode manner.  Only he never does explode, and it is
particularly telling that Jimmy's one big emotional outburst occurs
behind a closed door.  We need to see Jimmy as a charater reacting
to what is happening to him, but by playing him with an omnipresent
hangdog resignation, Caruso might have been the KISS OF DEATH for a
potentially engrossing thriller.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 state's witnesses:  6.</PRE>
