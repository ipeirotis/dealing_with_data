<P>Of all the films I've come to see this year (1997), I think only CHASING AMY
had as many "laugh-out-loud" moments. I'm not saying that I was hysterically
rolling on the floor while watching WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, but my mouth burst
open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes. And I
think I'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies, even when I find
them funny. Usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile, so to get me
laughing out loud, and so frequently, is a really good sign.</P>
<P>WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is the story of Blaine, Missouri, a town celebrating it's
150th anniversary, and the musical that is being put on for the big event.
The play is being directed by Corky St. Clair (Christopher Guest, who also
wrote and directed this "mockumentary" as well as co-writing several original
musical numbers), the effeminate Broadway hopeful determined to make this
production a smashing success. Teaming up with St. Clair are a handful of
Blaine residents: Allan Pearl (Eugene Levy), a Jewish dentist who spent his
youth not AS the class clown, but sitting right next to him and studying him,
Ron and Sheila Albertson (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara respectively), a
married couple setting their sights on Hollywood, Libby Mae Brown (Parker
Posey), the dense but fun Queen of the Dairy Queen, and a few others.</P>
<P>Everybody in this movie is brilliant, absolutely so, but Levy particularly
stands out. These characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that
you can't help but love them, as pathetic as they really are. Although Levy
stands out, Guest, Willard, O'Hara, and Posey are all wonderful and
definitely should be commended for their performances! If there was an Oscar
for an ensemble performance, this is the group that should sweep it.</P>
<P>Some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and, even after
starting very humorously, they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros.
As delightful as it was, it began to get monotonous. Thankfully, just as your
about to say "ok, maybe I should run to the bathroom", they finally get past
the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes. Like a play, this film gives a very
three-act feel, the intros (funny, but almost too long), the rehearsals (even
funnier), and finally, the actual performance of the play (excellent!).</P>
<P>Like I said, each character really shines, even when done with a subtle
approach. You can't really watch these people and not think they're real
people! Even they way they talk, with awkward pauses and stumbles that don't
feel staged at all, you feel like you're watching a real, albeit funny,
documentary. And even with silly lyrics, the original songs when the play is
finally put on, are absolutely wonderful!</P>
<P>As a word of note, despite it's "R" rating, WAITING FOR GUFFMAN is really
quite clean. This rating came from a brief, VERY brief use of the grand-daddy
of all swear words. Even if that really bothers you, let me say that it's not
presented in a vulgar, cheap-laugh way. It's actually quite humorous and
tastefully done!</P>
<P>It might be hard knowing what to expect with WAITING FOR GUFFMAN. It's silly
humor, but it's also so dry, subtle, and intelligently done that you're not
insulted by it. It's always really nice to see a comedy that isn't all
slapstick and vulgarity, and this film is one of the better ones of the
better ones! I'd recommend seeing it!</P>
