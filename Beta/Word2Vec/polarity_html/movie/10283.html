<P>     You have to admire Dreamworks' guts for using a mouse in a direct 
challenge to Disney's family feature dominance (in fact, not only do 
they use it, but they make jokes about using it).  Unfortunately, that's 
one of the few admirable things about MOUSEHUNT, a clever but 
surprisingly stale exercise in tedium that's supposed to pass for a 
slapstick-laden live cartoon.  It's easy to see how the film makers 
thought they had a winning comedy on their hands, but the fatal flaw is 
in the design and execution, not the premise.</P>
<P>     MOUSEHUNT is HOME ALONE with a rodent in the place of Macaulay 
Culkin (which, regardless of how you feel about the child actor, is not 
an improvement).  The Smuntz brothers, Ernie (Nathan Lane) and Lars (Lee 
Evans), inherit two things from their recently-departed father:  a 
rundown string making business and an even more rundown mansion.  Much 
to their surprise, it turns out that both are worth a lot of money.  
But, although Lars refuses to sell the business (he made a deathbed 
promise to his father to keep it in the family), both brothers agree to 
fix up the house, then auction it off.  There's one little problem, 
however:  the mansion is infested by a mouse, and it's an extremely 
smart, devious, and dangerous little animal.  When Ernie and Lars can't 
get rid of the unwanted pest, and a feline named Catzilla is equally 
unsuccessful, they call in an exterminator (Christopher Walken).  He too 
turns out to be no match for the "Hitler with a tail."</P>
<P>     On an intellectual level, I can appreciate the potential amusement 
value of a story in which a mouse outwits and beats up a group of inept 
human beings.  The problem is, with all of its physical comedy, this 
movie is going for a more visceral appeal.  To that end, it makes a 
serious mistake.  MOUSEHUNT alienates the audience from all of the on-
screen characters, and the distance is so great that it's difficult to 
care about any of the participants, regardless of whether they're four-
legged or two-legged.  This lack of involvement caused me to lose 
interest.  It's also never clear whether the film makers' sympathies lie 
with the cute rodent or the Smuntzes.  Who, if anyone, are we supposed 
to be rooting for?</P>
<P>     The film's ambivalent approach saps the life out of any humor.  
Some of the comic bits are inventive, but they're not funny.  The film 
isn't as lifeless as MR. MAGOO, but I still didn't react more positively 
than with an occasional smile.  Seeing people fall through floors and 
get snapped by mouse traps is only entertaining if it's properly set up.  
That's why we laugh when Wile E. Coyote endures physical abuse, but not 
when the same things happen to Nathan Lane.  </P>
<P>     Live action cartoons are hit-and-miss affairs (witness the 
differing quality of the aforementioned HOME ALONE and MR. MAGOO), and 
this one is more of a "miss" than a "hit".  MOUSEHUNT is a slapsticky 95 
minutes filled with dull, obligatory comedy that may amuse children but 
is unlikely to enthrall adults.  The special effects used to create the 
mouse are effective, with the antics of 60 real-life rodents and one 
animatronic creature seamlessly edited together by first-time feature 
director Gore Verbinski, who previously made the Budweiser frog 
commercials.  However, in today's marketplace, that's not much of an 
achievement.  Even Christopher Walken, playing a spoof of his usual 
creepy self, fails to generate much genuine humor.  His performance, 
like the rest of the picture, seems recycled.</P>
