<PRE>Review: COUSIN BETTE</PRE>
<PRE>Starring:        Jessica Lange
                Elisabeth Shue
                Bob Hoskins</PRE>
<PRE>Review by:        Joy Wyse</PRE>
<P>In the musical/movie "The Music Man" reference is made to the works of
"Balzac".  His novels are thought of as scandalous and should be banned
from the River City Library.  I can see why.  But in today's less
sheltered society, this is very entertaining.  Not only are we shown the
respectable side of life in the era, we are privy to the naughty goings-on
in the background.</P>
<P>Jessica Lange is the title character  who causes most of the mayhem that
engulfs the other's lives.  She has been secretly harboring resentment
against her cousin who married the man of her dreams.  After the cousin
dies, Bette is led to believe that he will now finally marry her. 
Instead, he offers her the position of housekeeper.  Little could he guess
how that "insult" could affect him.   Bette cleverly enlists the aid of
others in her scheme to have a happy ending, Bette-style.</P>
<P>There are hysterically funny scenes involving Bob Hoskins, whether in the
bedroom or on the dueling field.  Elisabeth Shue is perfectly cast as the
dance hall girl who seduces at will and for her own profit and enjoyment. 
As a warning to some: this IS Balzac, complete with some very naughty, but
fun,  sex scenes.    Don't leave early thinking that it's over [as some
people did].  There is a very clever final scene.</P>
<P>I will probably watch this again, on video or TV.  I give it a solid B.</P>
<PRE>See you at the movies.</PRE>
