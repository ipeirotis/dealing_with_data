<P>     The winter holiday season box office sweepstakes is on, with 
Paramount opening TITANIC, Fox weighing in with GREAT EXPECTATIONS and 
HOME ALONE 3, Warner Brothers sending out THE POSTMAN, Dreamworks 
releasing AMISTAD and MOUSEHUNT, Miramax debuting JACKIE BROWN and GOOD 
WILL HUNTING, Disney blinding us with MR. MAGOO, and Columbia/TriStar 
showing AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  So what "prestige title" is Universal 
contributing to the mix?  How about FOR RICHER OR POORER, Tim Allen's 
latest dud.  If ever a motion picture was destined for oblivion, this is 
it.  No major studio stands to make less money during December 1997.</P>
<P>     As comedies go, FOR RICHER OR POORER isn't absolutely terrible 
(it's better than HOME ALONE 3, for example), but neither is it 
particularly laudable.  All things considered, it's a pretty generic 
offering.  A few of the gags are capable of generating chuckles, but 
most are shockingly unfunny.  There's little or no genuine character 
development, and everyone on screen represents one form or another of 
stereotype.  The script is, to put it mildly, uninspired.  I see at 
least a dozen movies like this every year, and, by the time it comes to 
assemble my year-end retrospective, I find it difficult to distinguish 
one from another.  </P>
<P>     Creatively, this is Tim Allen's second motion picture failure of 
the year (the other was JUNGLE2JUNGLE).  Likewise, it's director Bryan 
Spicer's second straight bad outing (following hot on the heels of 
Bottom-10 contender MCHALE'S NAVY).  Together, these two talents 
definitely don't make magic.  In fact, they're hard pressed to make many 
laughs.  Worse still, FOR RICHER OR POORER clocks in at an unbearably 
long 116 minutes.  There's no way that a light, essentially-pointless 
comedy should be this long.  Cut about 30 minutes off the running time, 
and it might be a shade more bearable.  </P>
<P>     A better name for FOR RICHER OR POORER would probably be WITLESS, 
since it seems designed as a takeoff on the Harrison Ford thriller, 
WITNESS.  The basic premise has Brad and Caroline Sexton (Tim Allen and 
Kirstie Alley), an ultra-rich couple on the verge of a divorce, being 
forced to flee from their New York City penthouse when the IRS discovers 
some irregularities in their tax returns.  It seems that their 
accountant (Wayne Knight) has absconded with $5 million, and left the 
Sextons holding the bag.  Now, an overzealous IRS agent (Larry Miller) 
wants to put them behind bars or shoot them -- whichever is most 
expedient.  Their flight from the law takes them to Intercourse, 
Pennsylvania -- Amish country.  By pretending to be visitors from the 
Midwest, they find refuge with one family.  The rest of the film follows 
them as they grow to appreciate the simple way of life, and, in the 
process, fall in love again with each other.  </P>
<P>     While Allen is merely bland, Kirstie Alley is downright irritating.  
The actress appears stuck in CHEERS mode.  This is a television 
performance on the big screen, and its limitations show.  No one else in 
the cast does much to eclipse her, however.  Wayne Knight and Michael 
Lerner have small parts.  Jay O. Sanders and Megan Cavanaugh, playing 
the Amish couple the Sextons live with, have a little more screen time, 
but their roles, like their performances, are largely forgettable.  </P>
<P>     Most of the film's limited humor comes as a result of Allen, who 
occasionally displays an aptitude for physical comedy.  There's also a 
mildly amusing gag concerning an old man who arrives at 4:45 am each 
morning to get everyone up for the day's work.  Larry Miller is supposed 
to be funny, but I never found myself laughing at his uptight, tough guy 
routine.  Other than that meager fare, there's not much mirth to be 
found in FOR RICHER OR POORER, and, since the drama is insubstantial and 
irritating, that means the movie doesn't have a lot to offer.  Universal 
should have kept this one under wraps until Christmas was over.</P>
