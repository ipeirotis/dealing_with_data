<PRE>Les Vacances de M. Hulot
Rating: **** (out of four)
NR, 1953
Directed, written by, and starring Jacques Tati. </PRE>
<P>Jacques Tati's 1953 classic "Les Vacances de M. Hulot" (also known as "Mr.
Hulot's Vacation," in English) ought to be the textbook on how to do
non–dialogue comedy in film. The characters hardly ever speak to each other
directly, and the film operates on the paper–thin premise that Monsieur Hulot,
played by Tati himself, is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy
the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week's
vacation. Yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than
any in recent memory. </P>
<P>Part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various
gags. Slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude
form of comedy, but I think part of the reason for this is that it often seems
forced: you can only see movie characters start running after something and
then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder
what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people
don't watch where they're going. In "Les Vacances de M. Hulot," the gags build
upon each other and often start out relatively low-key. In one sequence, for
example, Hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when,
while his back is turned, the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves,
washes away, then comes back up on the other side of the boat. While crossing
over to get the can, Hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it. When
he actually takes the boat out into the water, it breaks in half, but the two
halves flip up against each other, trapping him inside as the bystanders
mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues. Tati doesn't waste a
single opportunity for humor; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most
comedies are good for at least four or five in this film. </P>
<P>It has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's
expectations, and "Les Vacances de M. Hulot" succeeds brilliantly in that area
as well. Tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan
understatement. When Hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts
playing a record at defeaningly loud volume, no fights or shouting matches
ensue; instead, the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the
room, disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled Hulot sitting in
the dark. Tati also uses running gags to this effect, allowing them to keep
running far longer than most comedy directors would; more often than not, we
can see them coming and think, "Oh, he's not going to do that  again," but, lo
and behold, he does. For example, there is a recurring joke in which Hulot's
noisy, sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an
exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one. Then this image
turns up again in the finale, which I will not give away other than to say
that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine
could ever produce. </P>
<P>The ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as
opposed to merely an above-average, clever comedy. As much as I was laughing
during this film, I was thinking to myself occasionally that Tati had to top
himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience;
suffice it to say that he did. The other important aspect is that the film
never seems disdainful of its characters. It easily could have turned the
tables on Hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him;
alternatively, it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons.
Instead, Tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than
anything else and invites the audience to like them, however strange or
irritating they might seem. </P>
<P>"Les Vacances de M. Hulot" is not subtitled, but the dialogue is sparse and
for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events. Anyone with a
taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental
from the video store.</P>
<P>NOTE: "Les Vacances de M. Hulot" was not rated by the MPAA. It would at most
receive a PG rating.</P>
