<PRE>                               ANTONIA'S LINE
                                 (ANTONIA)
                       A film review by Steve Rhodes
                        Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>      ANTONIA'S LINE (ANTONIA) is a film from The Netherlands that is
one of the nominees for best foreign language picture of 1995.  For
completeness sake, the others are: ALL THINGS FAIR (Sweden), DUST OF
LIFE (Algeria), O QUATRILHO (Brazil), and THE STAR MAN (Italy).  Why
they left out the wonderful SHANGHAI TRIAD (China) and THE PROMISE
(Germany), I have no idea.  ANTONIA'S LINE is the story of about fifty
years in the life of a Dutch woman named Antonia (Willeke Van
Ammelrooy) and of her family.</P>
<P>     The film starts in what appears to be the present.  Antonia is
getting out of bed, which is a little hard for her that day since she
has decided that it is the day she will die.  The coming of death
focuses her mind on the past and on her mother's death.</P>
<P>     The story flashes back about fifty years.  Antonia is taking her
daughter Daniklle (Jan Decleir) with her to witness the death and then
the burial of Antonia's mother.  It is right after the end of World War
II, and the banners of freedom and liberation are flying everywhere in
Holland.  Soon we find out how whimsical this film will be.  Antonia's
mother refuses to die.  In fact during her funeral, she rises out of
the coffin and starts singing "My Blue Heaven" in English.  This type
of craziness can work in a well constructed movie, but the script by
Marlene Gorris is a mess.  There are numerous other examples of
eccentric behavior.  A typical one is the woman who opens her window to
howl at the moon, which disturbs the man who lives in the apartment
below her.  He hits the ceiling with a broomstick and looks like he is
ready to kill her.</P>
<P>     The funeral is a beautiful Roman Catholic service full of incense
and ceremony, but Antonia quickly proclaims that she thinks it is "all
rubbish."  As is popular in the modern cinema, the church is ridiculed.
In a scene that will be repeated innumerable times throughout the
picture, a man is mean and insensitive to others less powerful than he.
In this case, it is a priest who pushes an altar boy in front of the
entire congregation during the service.  As a sex, we learn in this
mean spirited film, that we men are brutish at best.  The only
exception seems to be mentally retarded men who come off as being
victims along with most of the females.  A one sided view of life that
makes the men in the audience want to leave in the dark by the side
exit of the theater before the lights go up in fear that one of the
women will cry out, "there goes one of them, get him".</P>
<P>     Antonia is a match for males of any age.  When she comes across a
five year old throwing a rock at a mentally handicapped man known as
Loony Lips, she takes the little boy and leaves him hanging on a hook
in the woods where he can not get down by himself.  The director
(Marlene Gorris) wants you to feel no sorrow for the kid even if the
show's heroine does put the kid in a scary and life threatening
situation.  He did throw that rock remember.</P>
<P>     Later in the show there is a rape scene that is punished as well,
but I will not go into the details of that punishment.  We also have
men hitting a mentally disabled girls on the head just for pure
meanness.  In this type of world, it is perhaps not surprising that
when Daniklle announces she wants a baby, she is not interested in a
man at all.  This conundrum is solved by find a friendly female who has
a brother who promises to have sex with Daniklle and then leave
forever.  Daniklle does it with him in complete boredom.  From there
the story moves on and includes Antonia's granddaughter Therese (Els
Dottermans) and her great-granddaughter Sarah (Thyrza Ravesteijn).</P>
<P>     There is no story to speak of.  The film is more an eclectic
collection of incidents in Antonia's life.  Each is like a
self-contained morality tale where we learn about the purity of women
and evil of the men who victimize them.  If the film had attempted more
balance, perhaps I could have gotten beyond its pedantic messages, but
as constructed, I felt like the defendant in a Kafka trial, and I kept
wanting to cry out, "I'm not guilty!"</P>
<P>     On a positive note, the Dutch scenery is lovely and the
cinematography (Willy Stassen) captures it well.  The director, while
too oppressive for my taste, did demonstrate a high degree of control
and is not afraid to take risks with crazy antics.</P>
<P>     ANTONIA'S LINE runs 1:33 and even less would have been better in
my book.  It is in Dutch with English subtitles.  The film is not rated
but is most certainly an R movie.  There is sex, nudity, and violence
especially rape scenes.  I would not let teenagers go unless they were
mature, and I would want to discuss it with them afterwards if they did
go.  I do not recommend this movie, and I give it a single *.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
