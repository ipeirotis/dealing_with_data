<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Set in the mid-'60s, in Clairton, Pennsylvania, a small steelworker's
town steeped in hellish fire and smoke, crested by the Allegheny
Mountains, is where a saga of friendship unfolds among three guys who
work in the mill, hunt together, drink in the same bar, go bowling
together, belong to the same Russian orthodox church, and who don't want
to escape from their ordinary existence, quite content to live out their
life in such a blue-collar town. What they do, that changes their life
irrevocably, is enlist for military duty in Vietnam, joining the elite
airborne unit, out of a sense of patriotic duty, at a time when America
was beginning to question the war. But in their town, there were no
protests and their joining of the army was well-received by the locals
in this close-knit community.</P>
<P>Steven (John Savage), just before the boys go to Vietnam, does the
honorable thing to do and gets married to his pregnant girlfriend Angela
(Rutanya Alda), telling himself that he loves her and can't leave her in
this embarrassing predicament while he goes off to war and might never
come back. His old-fashioned Russian immigrant mother (Shirley Stoler)
is upset about this marriage, not understanding why he is marrying her
and what is happening to the world nowadays, as she complains about this
to the reticent Russian priest.</P>
<P>The wedding is a traditional affair, as the camera catches it in all its
glitter and ceremony inside the local Russian church, as it brings
together the life-long friends he enlisted with, the quiet but
hard-to-figure leader of the group and expert hunter, Michael (Robert De
Niro), and Nick (Christopher Walken), who will be the kingly best man at
the wedding. Nick's date is the queenly best lady, Linda (Meryl Streep),
someone Michael has his eye on and would love to go out with, but does
not go out with her because of his loyalty to his close friend, to her
dismay.</P>
<P>At the lengthy reception, the inner circle of friends make their
presence felt and the viewers get to know them rather intimately, as
they are so comfortable with each other that their gibes at one another
are taken with a grain of salt. There is Stan (John Cazale-he was Fredo
in The Godfather- he died of cancer after making this film), who likes
to carry a pistol around with him and act macho. John (George Dzundza)
is the bartender where they hangout, and Axel (Chuck Aspegren) works
with the boys in the mill. They all join in the merriment of the feast,
loosening up by consuming an ample supply of vodka and beer.The wedding
reception was a long drawn out affair, showing everyone in the community
pitching in and helping with the celebration. Even with a minimal amount
of conversations taking place, the characters were seen dancing and
horsing around, as their personalities were allowed to shine forth in a
natural manner. The one very pertinent conversation to occur, was when a
special forces sergeant (D'Amato) walked into the bar and Michael and
some of the boys tried to get friendly with him and ask him about
Vietnam and all he would respond with is, "F*ck it." There was one more
scene to be remembered, where the bandleader (Grifasi) offers the
wedding couple wine attached with two cups on one long stem and tells
them that the tradition is not to spill any wine and the marriage will
be a long and happy one. As an omen to come, there are a few drops,
unnoticed by the wedding party, that spill on her wedding dress, while
they are drinking.</P>
<P>This epic film that runs for 183 minutes, is really divided into three
parts: the friends before Vietnam, during Vietnam, and after Vietnam.
The first part closes with a metaphorical deer hunt, as all the close
friends of the three volunteers are together for the last time before
they go into the service tomorrow. For Michael, the hunt is like a
religious experience, a deer has to be taken with one shot or else he
lets it go. That he has no respect for the sniveling Stan as a hunter,
who comes to the hunt without a pair of boots, is shown, as Michael
picks a silly fight with him and refuses to lend him his extra pair of
boots. He does this in order to let Stan know, that even though they are
both go hunting together, they do not have the same attitude about
hunting. When Michael stalks a deer and takes him down with one shot,
somehow, his kill seems to be the right way to do it.</P>
<P>Part 2 takes place in Vietnam. It graphically shows the horrors of the
war and the torturous experience these three friends undergo after they
are captured by the Vietcong. The three friends come out of this tragic
situation different people. Being forced to play "the one shot-one kill
game" of Russian roulette by their captors, as their nerves are about to
snap. In reality, this never occurred in Vietnam; but, it is used by
Cimino as a necessary metaphor to show how insane the war is. This
one-shot theory when it is used for deer hunting, can be seen as
something sensible, as if it reflects true sportsmanship. But when the
tables are turned and the men become the prey, like in war or in Russian
roulette, the one-shot hunter's theory doesn't seem to hold up anymore
as some great humanitarian concept.</P>
<P>Michael emerges from his war experiences with an inner strength and
courage that makes him tough it out, not giving an inch to his
tormentors, and by his sheer will-to-survive leads an escape. He seems
to be a natural leader. On the other hand, Nicky becomes a basket case,
losing control of who he is, losing contact with everyone, remaining in
Saigon and playing Russian roulette for a living in the underground
gambling clubs there. The lesson learnt, is that the men can't escape
from Vietnam, just like they can't escape from where they were born.</P>
<P>Part 3 is emotionally powerful and gripping, taking place for the most
part back in Western Pennsylvania, as the deep friendship of the three
is played out against the American failures in Vietnam, as the war is by
now considered a lost cause by the public. Steven can't face himself as
a cripple and shrivels up, afraid to come home from the hospital, and is
viewed as a defeated man. Michael, the war hero, coming back to his
hometown looking sharp in his uniform and seeming to be on the surface
back to his normal self, but when he goes out hunting with the boys, he
misses with his one shot at the buck, something he never did before. So,
even, he can't hide how the war has gutted his insides and changed him.
As for Nick, he is lost somewhere in Vietnam and can't be saved by
Michael, who tried unsuccessfully to get him back from Vietnam alive.</P>
<P>The most eerie scene in the film is saved for last, as the friends
huddle together, all of them disappointed and devastated about how their
lives turned out, trying to hold onto the only thing that has weathered
the storm for them, the unswerving friendship they have for each other
and the sense of community that prevails, as they have breakfast
together and begin to sing with all sincerity, like it was meant to be
sung, "God Bless America," as the film tragically ends with De Niro
proposing a toast to Nick.</P>
<P>This film offers a very puzzling and complex moral take on the war and
on those who were directly affected by it, as Cimino makes no apology
for the volunteer soldiers fighting a bad war, he only revels in how
poignant Michael's odyssey is-for he is the hero of this story and the
most compelling one in it-but even he can't feel at home after his
adventure, his war experiences were too mind-boggling for him to even
talk about what is bothering him.</P>
<P>What makes this film exceptional, one of the best films of the '70s, is
not the story, which is good but not great, and not the cinematography,
which is pleasing in scope but doesn't break new ground in its camera
work. It is the performers themselves who take the story to
spell-binding heights and make this a great film, making you care
enormously about the characters they play. De Niro gives a riveting
performance as he searches for meaning to his life, making his
patriotism seem genuine and his participation in a war that made no
sense to a lot of people, something that needs no apology, just like his
deer kill is done like a true sportsman would do it; that is, if you
must kill a deer, at least, do it the right way. Streep's performance is
more subtle, as her facial expressions give way to the great
psychological strain she is under, not sure of what is happening to her,
but realizing that there is a tremendous void in her life. John Savage
is convincing as a good guy who got a few bad breaks in life and
couldn't fully recover from it. Walken won an Oscar as a supporting
actor, in a film that won a total of five Oscars, including those for
best picture, editing, sound, and director. Walken was believable,
playing a regular guy who just lost it in Vietnam and went into a shell.
The remainder of the cast added to the haunting feeling that this was a
tale of significant moral and political weight. Cazale's performance as
a weasel, staying out of the war, hiding behind a phony macho persona,
is a fitting one, in contrast to the guys who enlisted.</P>
<P>It is an astonishing film. A one of a kind experience. A film that in
its minute details of the friend's lives, glaringly goes about to reveal
how war shatters everybody, whether they go to war or stay home. The
stupidity of the war and all its atrocities, as it is stunningly
presented by the filmmaker, leaves one without a chance to escape the
moral implications of the war or does it give one a chance to recapture
a lost innocence. The filmmaker seems to be saying, you can run away
from Vietnam and try to avoid it, but you can't get completely away from
it, its devastation touched every part of America, and this film, whose
viewpoint is not taken from the liberal side of the political spectrum,
as anti-war films usually are, but wants to respect the opinions of
conservative working -class America, the one's who sent their sons to
fight this war. And what the film offers as a poignant reminder about
war, even as it is a testament to the soldiers of the war, is how the
war harmed even those who coolly survived it, and how it left the
American psyche scarred for life. The film also clearly showed the
transformation of character for the three (Michael emotionally, Steven
physically, and Nick psychologically), as the protagonists go from being
happy-go-lucky types, proud to be born in America, to being
disillusioned about what has has taken place and are forced to sing a
patriotic song at the film's end in order to try and regain that natural
feeling they once had, realizing that something has gone out of their
American dream forever, that even these close friends couldn't save each
other from the tragic events.</P>
