<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"Trojan Eddie" is a bleak and unsentimental portrait of a gypsy group in
a small unnamed Irish town. John Power (Harris) is the 70-year-old,
white-haired, gaunt faced, strong-armed patriarch to a gang of itinerant
Irish gypsies, thieves, tinkers and unscrupulous salesmen known as
travellers. He is mean-spirited and ornery.</P>
<P>The film is not a touristy tale; it is based on Irish folklore. The main
problem it has, is that  the story gets bogged down on unnecessary
subplots, which make it difficult to focus entirely on the main story.
It is seen through the eyes of a glib and talented salesman, known as
Trojan Eddie (Rea), who can't handle things when he isn't hustling
merchandise for the big boss, John Power. His private life is a mess.
His ex-wife Shirley (Ball) is a tramp. She drops by his house needing a
place to stay, which he generously agrees to, but she treats him with
disdain, getting his ire when she taunts him that he might not be the
father of the kids. He raises their two young daughters without her
help, after he spent a year in prison for a bungled robbery, taking the
full rap, not snitching on his weasel-like partner Rayme (McGinley).
Ginger Power (Brendan), the boss's bully son, treats him like a loser.</P>
<P>Eddie is a worrier, walking around with a constant look of anxiety on
his face, which he never takes off except when auctioning off the stolen
merchandise. He is the only character that the audience can relate to in
a kindly way, as this lowlife hustler, willing to cheat his friends and
neighbors, might have some appeal and some might find him to be in a
strange way, likable.</P>
<P>Harris is powerful as an old, prideful man, who can't forget how tough
he was as a youth, not wanting to let go of his youth, easily wounded by
any slur he imagines being cast against him. He is intimidating to
everyone around him. Only, he is saddened by the loss of his wife and
eyes a sexy teen-age girl, who reminds him of her, Kathleen (Aislin
McGuckin). He tempts this itinerant girl with his possessions and asks
her hand in marriage. After she accepts, while chaperoned home by Eddie
and his partner, a kid about the age of Kathleen's, John's nephew Dermot
(Townsend). The youngsters sneak off in the field and have sex, but John
finds out about it, though he is not sure if Dermot or a boy he seen her
talking to, Patsy McDonagh (Gilroy), was the culprit. But he still
insists on the wedding.</P>
<P>At the wedding, the couple collect eleven thousand pounds for their
dowry in a tin box, which Eddie brings into the house and gives to
Kathleen. But she has other plans, as she runs away on her wedding night
with Dermot and with the money, to the embarrassment of John. He
immediately sends his men out looking for them. He also thinks Eddie
might be a part of this, warning him that all will be forgiven if the
girl comes back when she is ready and the money is returned intact.</P>
<P>The cast is top-notch, led by Harris's bone-chilling arrogant hoodlum
portrayal, who can't stop bullying people. Rea is equally as good, in a
role that is a take-off on the frenetic Crazie Eddie character who years
ago was seen hawking goods on American TV. He is  emotionally wrought at
not being able to straighten his life out, and not till the very end of
the film do we see him get some satisfaction from dealing with his
bullying boss. The landscape reflected the hard life of its denizens. It
showed the muddy roads of the rural Ireland community, their shany
houses, the dingy buildings where the salesmen auctioned off the stolen
goods, and the rotten attitude the itinerants had to the townies.</P>
<P>The actors brought life and passion to this morbid story of failed love,
a failed love for both the young and the old. It is a story of how
self-interest and thievery rule the day when all is said and done. A
very scornful look at what some will do to get what they want or think
they want. It is worth seeing for the tremendous performances and a bit
of the gritty local flavor not usually seen about a film emanating from
Ireland.</P>
<P>Written by Irish playwright Billy Roche and directed with verve by
Gillies MacKinnon, whose last feature, Small Faces, was a coming of age
tale set in the violence-ridden housing projects of Glasgow in the '60s.</P>
