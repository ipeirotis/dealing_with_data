<PRE>                               HIGHER LEARNING
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Omar Epps, Kristy Swanson, Michael Rapaport, Ice Cube,
           Laurence Fishburne, Tyra Banks, Jennifer Connelly.
Screenplay/Director:  John Singleton.</P>
<P>     When I learned that John (BOYZ N THE HOOD) Singleton was making
a film about issues of race and gender on college campuses, I was
intrigued and optimistic.  Though POETIC JUSTICE was a misfire, BOYZ
showed that Singleton could tell a story, and after nearly ten years
around Stanford, one of the nation's hotbeds of multicultural
experimentation, I knew that there were many stories to tell.
HIGHER LEARNING shows that Singleton recognized that fact as well;
unfortunately, he tried to tell them all in one movie.  It's an
ambitious but unfocused effort which is admirable for its balanced
perspective but leaves critical characters as mere representations
of the stereotypes it seems to be challenging.</P>
<P>     HIGHER LEARNING follows three freshmen at fictional Columbus
University.  Malik (Omar Epps) is an African-American track star who
is challenged by the incendiary anti-establishment views of
sixth-year senior Fudge (Ice Cube) and by the more moderate opinions
of his political science professor (Laurence Fishburne); Kristen
(Kristy Swanson) is a Southern California blonde who is drawn to a
lesbian upperclassman (Jennifer Connelly) after an acquaintance
rape; Remy (Michale Rapaport) is a white male from Idaho whose
desire to fit in somewhere leads him to a group of white supremists.
The truce between these students and their respective factions is an
uneasy one at best, but it explodes into violence when a conflict
between Malik and Remy goes over the edge, drawing the entire campus
into it.</P>
<P>     For fully half of its running time, HIGHER LEARNING appears to
be headed in the right direction.  Unlike contemporaries Oliver
Stone and Spike Lee, Singleton does know how to present challenging
and controversial subject matter without shouting at the top of his
lungs in every frame.  In a Stone film, the hero's two mentors would
be manifestations of Good and Evil; Singleton, on the other hand,
makes both Fudge and Professor Phipps smart and sensible characters,
leaving the audience to draw its own conclusions.  It doesn't hurt
that both roles are played by magnetic screen presences.  Ice Cube
has true star potential, a powerful personality and a fine actor,
and he keeps Fudge from being simply a spouter of dogma.  Laurence
Fishburne's Phipps doesn't really need a West Indian accent, but he
shows a genuine concern for Malik, and also keeps his speeches from
sounding didactic.  Malik's storyline is the most carefully plotted,
and Omar Epps' fine performance as the young man weighing two views
of being black in America makes it the most interesting to watch.</P>
<P>     But Singleton fails to give his other two principles the same
kind of depth.  Kristy Swanson shines in early scenes which show her
trying to fit in with other girls and learning to express her own
point of view in Phipps' class.  Then, as Kristen's sexual
experimentation becomes the focus, Singleton pulls back, and never
tries to get inside her head after a love scene in which she is
alternately with Jennifer Connelly's Taryn and Malik's gentle
roommate (Jason Wiles); both relationships are sadly
under-developed.  Michael Rapaport's Remy has almost identical
problems, beginning as a lost soul and ending up a crazed skinhead.
His story could have been an opportunity to examine why real,
intelligent young people feel so threatened in a multi-cultural
society, but he's pushed so far to the fringe that he becomes a
cartoon.</P>
<P>     The problems with those two characters are representative of
what is most wrong with HIGHER LEARNING, particularly in its second
half.  While Singleton seems to want us to "unlearn" stereotypical
perceptions (as his none-too-subtle coda informs us), it is exactly
stereotypes that he traffics in.  The feminist character is an
earnest lesbian, the frat guy is a rapist, the campus security
guards are posturing racists, every African-American male is angry
and the one Sensitive White Male is a long-haired bohemian type.
Once the "sieg heil" shouting Hitler youth take center stage, it
becomes clear that Singleton has eschewed examining the complexities
of the way young people learn to interact at a university in
exchange for an operatic, hiss-at-the-bad-guys kind of drama.
HIGHER LEARNING is awash in good intentions, but too often it's
terribly simplistic, taking a story which should have been about the
shaping of minds and reducing it to a matter of who's got the guns.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 college credits:  5.</PRE>
