<P>     Sometimes lovers are separated by race.  Other times, it's age.  On
still other occasions, it's religion.  But in THE PROMISE, Sophie and
Konrad are the same nationality, the same age, and the same faith.  What
divides them is an ugly construct of stone and barbed wire that becomes
a symbol of the cold war.  In Berlin during the 1960s, nothing was more
tragic than the reality of families, friends, and lovers kept apart by
what became known simply as "the Wall."</P>
<P>     The Berlin wall was erected in the summer of 1961, mere months
before the start of this film.  Back then, in the early days, a crossing
was less difficult than it eventually would become.  As THE PROMISE
opens, Sophie (Meret Becker), Konrad (Anian Zollner), and two friends
have planned an escape to the West that relies on a hastily-sketched map
of miles of underground sewers.  When the time arrives to climb through
a manhole and a passing guard troop passes dangerously near to the
escape route, Konrad stays behind to cover the others' tracks.  He
promises to join his girlfriend and her pals later, but he never does.
The script leaves it carefully ambiguous whether it's circumstances or
his own reluctance to leave behind his family that keep him in the East.
Regardless, the Wall now divides Sophie and Konrad, whose love for each
other holds them both in misery.</P>
<P>     By 1968, Konrad has become a respected astronomer, and is allowed
to travel to Prague for a seminar.  After receiving his letter, Sophie
meets him there.  Recriminations give way to passion, and the two spend
joyous weeks together, full of bright promises for the future.  Shortly
after Sophie becomes pregnant, however, events split the couple, with
Konrad again in the East and Sophie in the West.</P>
<P>     Their next meeting occurs twelve years later.  This time, the lead
actors have been seamlessly switched (Corinna Harfouch now plays Sophie;
August Zimer, Konrad).  By now, Konrad is married and has a daughter,
and Sophie is living with someone.  Their common link is their son,
Alexander, and Konrad, as a top-level scientist, is allowed visitation
privileges, until a rash act on his part earns him the displeasure of
the Stasi.</P>
<P>     The final segment is in November 1989, at the fall of the Wall.
Equally full of promise and poignancy, this sequence not only gives the
film closure, but highlights its principal differences from Hollywood
romances.  THE PROMISE ends on an ambiguous note, allowing the viewer to
draw his or her own conclusions about what comes next.</P>
<P>     Director Margarethe von Trotta effortlessly weaves history and
personal events into a tapestry full of emotion and irony.  Sophie and
Konrad are likeable and we, as an involved audience, can't help but root
for them to reach each other, even while recognizing that their
different values and goals make a lasting union unlikely.  Von Trotta
doesn't cheat either side of her story, West or East.  People and
politics mix, but nothing is black or white in exploring one of many
tales about the Wall.</P>
<P>     Individual scenes stick in the mind.  A man opens a stepladder near
the Wall, climbs to the top, and waves to relatives (a daughter and
granddaughter?) watching from a facing apartment window in the East.
Near him, vans blaring propaganda wage a war of words across the
barrier.  Later, a boy in the West throws a ball over the Wall.  Moments
later, unseen hands return it.  When he is asked how it comes back, he
responds that he doesn't know, but it always happens that way.</P>
<P>     The scope of THE PROMISE is ambitious--an allegorical tale of
love and loss spanning three decades in the heart of a country sundered
by an unnatural boundary.  Because von Trotta has only two hours to work
with, she cannot accomplish everything needed to explore the subject.
The results of such time constraints are that some subplots, and even
certain aspects of the main story, don't get their deserved exposure.
THE PROMISE mines a motherlode, but there's no way the full potential
can be unearthed in a single film.</P>
<P>     Nevertheless, there's more than enough here to satisfy a viewer
with a penchant for history, politics, or love.  In movies, romance is
often treated as a frothy thing, so it's rare to find the emotional
highs and lows of THE PROMISE.  Constructed with obvious care, this film
is filled with the little details that differentiate a very good picture
from an average one.  With this movie, at least, von Trotta delivers on
the promise of her ability as a film maker.</P>
