<P>     The most notable thing about THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES, director 
Barbra Streisand's third effort behind the camera, is its long and 
strife-filled production history.  The actual film that resulted is, at 
best, decent, and doesn't add anything new or interesting to the 
romantic comedy genre.  In fact, what THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES is in 
desperate need of is an editor.  At over two hours, this film drags on 
for far too long.  There comes a point in any romance when the 
characters must either be broken apart or brought together once and for 
all.  By delaying that moment for about twenty unnecessary minutes, 
Streisand risks losing her audience to disinterest.</P>
<P>     The basic storyline isn't all that complicated.  Streisand plays 
Rose Morgan, a professor at Columbia University who teaches a course in 
Romantic Literature.  Jeff Bridges is Gregory Larkin, a math professor.  
Neither has a particularly satisfying love life.  Frumpy Rose, the 
proverbial ugly duckling in search of romance, is constantly 
disappointed by her dates.  Gregory, who becomes inept around attractive 
women, can have all the sex he wants, but craves something deeper -- a 
"union of souls" that "takes sex out of the equation".  So, when Rose's 
sister, Claire (Mimi Rogers), reads a companionship ad that Gregory 
places in the paper, she contrives a meeting between the two.  Gregory 
and Rose strike up a fast friendship that leads to an unconventional 
marriage.  However, even after the wedding, their relationship remains 
platonic, and when Rose expresses a desire to have sex, Gregory flees.</P>
<P>     Roughly the first hour of THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES is enjoyable.  
We are introduced to the characters, see them interact, investigate 
their hopes, dreams, and fantasies, and watch them slowly, tentatively, 
test their feelings for each other.  There are some wonderful discourses 
on the nature of love that pose intriguing questions, a few of which the 
film goes on to explore at greater length.  </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the second half of the movie isn't as strong.  
Gregory, who struggles mightily to attain believability early, devolves 
into a caricature struggling with an implausible problem (he's afraid to 
have sex with his wife).  The film's delightful, romantic mood deflates 
quickly as Streisand starts to explore issues of insecurity and 
empowerment.  Two dimensional figures like Rose's "dream man", Alex 
(Pierce Brosnan), and her best friend (Brenda Vaccaro) make brief, 
unsatisfactory appearances to illustrate different aspects of Rose's 
personality after a makeover gives her self-confidence.  </P>
<P>     In some ways, THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES treads in similar territory 
to that which was explored earlier this year by the more successful THE 
TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS.  Janeane Garafolo's character there, like 
Streisand's here, is insecure about her appearance and becomes convinced 
that because she's "unattractive", she can never have a romantic 
relationship.  The principal difference between the two films is one of 
tone.  CATS AND DOGS maintains a light-hearted, occasionally goofy air, 
while THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES combines uneven comedy with the 
pretentiousness of trying to say something serious.  </P>
<P>     The cast is populated with good actors, which makes the lack of 
standout performances disappointing.  Streisand is by far the best, 
doing an excellent job of mixing wry humor, pathos, and longing.  Rose 
is the only character we ever really care about.  Jeff Bridges plays 
Gregory a little too broadly.  While his mingling of perkiness and 
naivete elicits a few laughs, it erodes Gregory's credibility as a 
living, breathing human being.  Lauren Bacall puts enough bite into her 
performance as Rose's neurotic, unsupportive mother that there are times 
when she's downright irritating.  There are also moments, however, when 
she's in top form.  In fact, Bacall and Streisand combine for one of the 
film's rare gems -- a scene where Rose asks her mother, "What did it 
feel like to be beautiful?"  Supporting roles are filled by Pierce 
Brosnan, George Segal, Mimi Rogers, Brenda Vaccaro, and Austin 
Pendleton.</P>
<P>     Streisand's direction is more sure here than it was in the 
overrated PRINCE OF TIDES, but the rambling script (based on that of a 
1958 French film) ultimately lets her down.  THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES 
has a certain charm, but most of the enchantment wears off before the 
climax.  Streisand has a reputation as a perfectionist who will drive 
people hard to attain the best results possible.  (A number of cast and 
crew members, including Dudley Moore and cinematographer Dante Spinotti, 
left in mid-production, because of "creative differences" with her.)  
Nevertheless, if the director truly is satisfied with the final cut, 
then her idea of perfection differs somewhat from mine.</P>
