<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The hollow man is a deranged, egotistical genius scientist, Dr.
Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon), in this witty sci-fi film that compares
favorably with Jimmy Whale's 1933 classic "The Invisible Man" for its
inventive use of ideas, until the film falls into a pyrotechnical
ending, forgoing ideas in favor of becoming a slasher movie about a
scientist going amok and smashing all his creations, his jealous mind
becoming crazed, as he attacks his research team, feeling that they
betrayed him and their work because they were worried solely about their
careers. But until then, it just seemed like a very entertaining pop
culture film, whose satire comes about in comic-strip form, as it tweaks
the side of sensibility in favor of perversity. But then again, it is
quite possible that the film is so polemic and so full of contempt for
society, that its theme revolves around the scientists surviving in a
wasteland anyway they can (maybe a referral to T.S. Eliot's poetical
work"The Hollow Man"). For Verhoeven, it is imperative that one must do
whatever it takes to get by in such a cold and unromantic world. If that
is the case and I suspect it is, then this film becomes a more sublime
work than I thought at first, chewing off more than what can be seen.
Its ideas do not completely vanish in flames by the film's end but just
smolder, even though the film never veers from being nihilistic.</P>
<P>The Dutch-born Paul Verhoeven (Starship Troopers/Total
Recall/Showgirls/Basic Instinct), a director I never thought much of
before as being subtle, thoroughly hating his fascistic parody, Starship
Troopers, and being only mildly accepting of his other sleazy films,
directed this thriller with an eye to his staple signature as an auteur
-- of misanthropy and lurid erotic behavior combined with mindbending
special-effects.</P>
<P>Inside the top-secret lab site in Washington, D.C., we see a rat in a
steel cage being devoured by an invisible creature as it goes for some
water while monitored by computers amid a dazzling display of high-tech
machines, in a dark and claustrophobic setting. The invisible creature
that gobbled it up and swallowed it, turns out to be a gorilla named
Isabelle the Pentagon-financed  research team uses as their subject for
a project on invisibilty.</P>
<P>Sebastian is the brains and team leader of this research team, one in
which he hand-picked. We first see him at home by his computer trying to
work out a configuration problem he was stuck on for the last eleven
months. Meeting with failure on the computer imaging, he looks out at
the apartment window across from his to peep at a beautiful woman
undress down to her bra and panties before she shuts the blinds. These
two failures in one evening bring the genius around to eating a Twinkie,
remembering that Da Vinci tried to never sleep, as he wanted his mind to
always remain active. With that in mind, he suddenly comes up with a
solution to the Isabelle invisible puzzle, and he calls his attractive
ex-girlfriend Linda (Shue) with the good news. She's in bed with her new
boyfriend, Matthew (Brolin), whom he doesn't know about. These two are
the star players on his team, though neither one has the magical genius
quality that Sebastian has, but they are nicer human beings than the one
whose hubris is so out of whack that he considers himself to be God. The
lab technicians on the team are Carter (Grunberg), Janice (Randle), and
Frank (Slotnick), each deferring to their project boss in a different
way, with Carter the less openly hostile to the boss than the other two,
even admiring him for driving a silver Porsche convertible and acting
just as hip as a rock star. The veterinarian of the group is the feisty
Sarah (Dickens), who is more concerned with the well-being of the
animals in these experiments than she is with the scientific
conclusions.</P>
<P>The team preps the gorilla for phase two of their research and finds
that they can make the gorilla invisible. The special effects are truly
stunning, as we watch the gorilla become invisible, as her body when it
changes looks like one of those see-through bodies in an anatomy
textbook. We next see Sebastian, Linda, and Matthew meeting with their
project director Dr. Kramer (Devane) and the Pentagon generals to report
their findings. But Sebastian throws the other two scientists a monkey
wrench, as he fails to tell the committee the positive results of the
experiment. Outside the meeting he explains to the other two, that if he
told Kramer what they discovered the experiment would be taken over by
the Pentagon and he wouldn't be running the show anymore.</P>
<P>He tells them that they'll move on to phase three on their own, that
he'll be the subject of the experiment, injecting himself with the aqua
blue serum that will make him invisible. But once injected with the
formula, a snag develops when Sebastian can't return from being
invisible. The research team is more petrified that their careers will
be ruined by this illegal research than if Sebastian will be OK, while
Sebastian seems to become more of an asshole than before and does the
adolescent thing an invisible male might do, he enters his neighbor's
apartment to stare at her naked breasts and then sexually attacks her,
he also spies on Linda in bed with Matthew and goes ape over what he
sees.</P>
<P>For the last 30 minutes or so of the film, the depraved Sebastian traps
his research team in their underground facility, and the film goes giddy
with gore and becomes a bloody slasher film of the research team getting
knocked off one by one, until it is Linda and Matthew as the only one's
left to send the evil scientist, who thinks he's God, to hell.</P>
<P>I might not have had much use for the creepy Sebastian, but I understood
his human defects: his selfish motivations and his sexual curiosity, as
annoying as those faults may be, at least it is something that was
explored by the director in his invisible man theme, something other
filmmakers of invisible men films haven't done, giving fire to the role
Kevin Bacon so ably played. I also found Elisabeth Shue to be alluring,
offering beauty and vulnerability, a sense of feminine instinctiveness,
intelligence and of endeavor, in a film that caught an hypnotic sense of
cynicism and ran with it. The remaining cast members looked as if they
would be part of a research team and filled the film with the proper
atmosphere needed. This is not a slasher film per se but it could be, it
had all the gore required for a movie appealing to teens looking for a
film with a quick mindless thrill. I found it to be most like a pop
culture treat ala Hollywood, adding its own brand of vitriolic delights
to the sci-fi/horror genre, which has spawned many films with much the
same tendencies, such as "Aliens " and "The Fly (86)," but none with the
same erotic tendencies and magnificent special effects. This one's a
visual delight, much more intense and sleazier than the other recent
similar films of this type, but one that can only push the pop culture
button so far, because what does it all mean seems to be lost in the
hollowness of the story itself.</P>
