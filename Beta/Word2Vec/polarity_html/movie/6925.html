<P>     Somewhere along the line, the makers of romantic comedies stopped
caring about whether their lead characters had any business being
together.  Perhaps in response to the complex ritual late-20th-century
courtship has become, audiences began to embrace film romances which had
as much to do with sorcery as chemistry -- SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, FOUR
WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL -- and film-makers have been only too happy to
provide more of the same.  The fairy tale, a perfectly enjoyable
expression of our dreams, is no longer simply a supplement to realistic
love in the movies; it practically has replaced it entirely.  FOOLS RUSH
IN is the next logical step in the transformation of screen romance into a
celebration of fate.  Where SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE asked you to root for a
couple who didn't meet until the final scene, FOOLS RUSH IN asks you to
root for a couple after you have spent over 100 minutes observing in grim
detail that they have absolutely nothing in common.</P>
<P>     Matthew Perry stars as Alex Whitman, a field representative for a
chain of nightclubs based in New York City.  Alex is supervising the
construction of a new location in Las Vegas when he meets Isabel Fuentes
(Salma Hayek), an aspiring photographer with a deep belief in destiny, in
a local bar.  The two share a one-night stand, but Isabel ducks out the
next morning before Alex wakes up.  Their destiny seems to be never to
meet again, until Isabel shows up three months later at Alex's door with a
startling revelation:  she is pregnant, and Alex is the father.  Though
Isabel is willing to keep and raise the baby on her own, Alex becomes
convinced that they should get married immediately.  That is what they do
at a Vegas chapel, but the honeymoon is extremely short-lived.  As the
newlyweds actually get to know each other, they find a host of obstacles
in the way, perhaps more than their instant family can withstand.</P>
<P>     Perhaps more than the audience can withstand, as well.  FOOLS RUSH IN
scripter Katherine Reback doesn't provide one really interesting conflict
between Alex and Isabel -- she provides a dozen moderately diverting
conflicts, with characters who are on screen barely long enough for you to
remember their names.  The couple quarrels over whether they will live in
New York or Las Vegas; they disagree over a religion for the baby.
Isabel's police officer ex-boyfriend (Carlos Gomez) scowls at Alex and
helps get him drunk on tequila; Alex's sort-of-ex-girlfriend (Suzanne
Snyder) meddles by calling Alex's parents.  Both sets of parents fret over
the hasty marriage; Alex frets over juggling career and family.  There is
so much quarreling and scowling and meddling and fretting going on from so
many different directions that you might find yourself wondering if you
have forgotten how perfect they are supposed to be for each other.</P>
<P>     Don't worry, you haven't forgotten.  All evidence suggests that the
only thing right in the relationship between Alex and Isabel is really
great sex, and I am not discounting the value of really great sex when I
say that it's not nearly enough.  FOOLS RUSH IN belongs to that class of
romantic comedies which demands that you accept the central pairing as
celestially foretold, and curse you for a fuddy-duddy with no sense of
romance if you object, as John Cleese once did in a classic "Cheers"
episode, that the only thing opposites attract is divorce.  The essential
change in Alex's character turns out to be that he "gets religion"
regarding fate, seeing signs everywhere reminding him of Isabel after the
two separate.  The happy ending doesn't seem to recognize that these
people need some serious counseling; apparently the Psychic Friends
Network will suffice.</P>
<P>     What makes FOOLS RUSH IN all the more frustrating is that there are
plenty of moments when it is tremendously entertaining.  You don't need to
be a fan of "Friends" to appreciate Perry, who can fire darts of sarcasm
and do reaction takes with the best of them.  He can be both funny and
warm, as he is in an appealing sequence at a Fuentes family gathering, and
it is easy to feel sympathetic towards Alex despite his near-sighted
careerism.  Salma Hayek is also quite good, conveying conflicted emotions
and frustration, and there is certainly heat between Perry and Hayek
(although, let's face it, Hayek could generate heat in a room full of
asbestos).  But FOOLS RUSH IN needs more than heat.  It needs a heart, a
sense of connection which comes from friendship as much as fantasy.  In a
film which throws so many problems and situations at the screen that
nothing sticks together, it is ironic that the only thing which does stick
together -- Alex and Isabel -- probably shouldn't.</P>
