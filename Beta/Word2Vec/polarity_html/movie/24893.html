<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A dark, moody noir tale about a marine who gets blown up by a grenade in
the South Pacific during a squirmish in WW11 and survives, only to
become an amnesia victim. He is released from duty by the marines, only
knowing that his name is George Taylor (John Hodiak) and that he's from
Los Angeles, but without treatment and without them knowing about his
amnesia. He has earned the Purple Heart and seems like a tough hombre,
willing to take chances.</P>
<P>He tries to piece together who he is with the only two leads he has to
go on: his name and a letter found in his wallet from a girlfriend who
is dead, telling him how much she hates him. In Los Angeles, he finds
another letter in a briefcase, stored in a train station terminal, that
is signed: your friend, Larry Cravat, telling him that $5,000 has been
deposited in the name of George Taylor at the bank. There is also a gun
in the briefcase. He realizes that he will probably find that he was not
a very nice guy, but continues the search to find himself, anyway.</P>
<P>At the bank, he arouses the teller's suspicion when he tries to make a
withdrawal and flees. He then goes to a Turkish bath because of the
heading on the stationary on one of his letters and tracks down a
nightclub his dead girlfriend worked in nearby. At the nightclub he is
set-up by the bartender and has two thugs go after him. He escapes into
the dressing room of one of the club singers, Christy Smith (Nancy), and
sees the photo of his dead girlfriend signed by her, as he steals the
photo and leaves behind his current hotel address. It turns out Christy
was best friends with her and tells her how her heart was broken by
Cravat, who stood her up at the altar, and she was so depressed, that
she didn't look up when crossing the street and a car ran her over after
she gave up waiting for him.</P>
<P>When he returns to his place, he finds someone named Phyllis (Margo)
waiting for him by the door who tries to get some information from him.
When he leaves his place after his visit with Phyllis, he is forced into
a car by a strongarm giant named Hubert (Nova) and a German accented man
named Anzelmo (Fritz). They beat him silly, trying to pump him for
information about Larry Cravat, but to no avail. When they are through
with him, they dump him in Christy's place, the only address they find
on him, where she patches him up and he levels with her that he can't
remember anything. It is love at second sight for her, as she decides
she believes him and offers to help.</P>
<P>The help comes from her amiable tough-guy nightclub boss Mel Phillips
(Conte), who introduces him at a Chinese restaurant, under a false name,
to Lt. Donald Kendall (Lloyd Nolan). But the cop figures it out whom he
is talking to, and he leaves a note with Phyllis' address on Christy's
car. Phyllis leads Taylor to Anzelmo's place, who it turns out, is a
small time chiselling fortune teller and she is his assistant. They all
lay their cards on the table and Taylor learns that Cravat got his hands
on $2 million dollars, money smuggled into this country by a Nazi, and
that somehow the fortune teller knew about this though he never met
Cravat. The problem was the Nazi died and a trail of bodies followed, as
that money and Cravat are still missing. It is also learned by him that
Cravat is wanted for murdering a man and the last one to see him with
the money was the one Cravat supposedly murdered.</P>
<P>The chase will become even more suspenseful now, as Taylor visits a man
(Houseley) who witnessed the murder but who was immediately run over
with a truck, only to survive and be placed as a mental case in a
private sanitarium, where he is allowed no visitors and is  not able to
recall anything. Taylor's chase will take him through the dark night, as
he hits the sanitarium, the spooky dock area, the missionary shelter,
and to the bar where he finally learns everything he needs to know by
having a showdown with Cravat's silent partner, the one who killed the
other person on the dock and is now trying to cover his back.</P>
<P>Mankiewicz does a nice job of creating the dark noir mood. The film is
laden with comedy, excellent performances, plenty of suspense, plus a
voice-over by John Ireland, and it manages to keep the pot boiling with
a quintessential amnesiac story.</P>
