<PRE>                             SET IT OFF
                    A film review by Steve Rhodes
                     Copyright 1996 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  *</PRE>
<P>     SET IT OFF is a warmed over THELMA AND LOUISE story full of
cliched racial stereotypes.  The whites discriminate and oppress while
the blacks drink heavily, smoke dope, and rob banks.  Both groups are
highly proficient in killing each other.</P>
<P>     Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier's manipulative script tries to
make you care for the hard working members from the projects, but it
overstates its case so badly that it loses most of its credibility.
SET IT OFF is a high energy show featuring lots of automatic weapons
and flying bullets.  The action rarely lags, and you need only wait
short intervals before another scene will do something to try to shock
you.</P>
<P>     Frankie (Vivica Fox from INDEPENDENCE DAY) is a recently promoted
teller at a bank.  As the show opens, her cheery day takes a turn for
the worse when Darnell, an acquaintance from the projects, comes to her
station.  She tells him that she is surprised he has enough money to
have a bank account.</P>
<P>     Darnell and his friends are there to rob the bank.  The heist goes
bad and people on both sides have their blood splatter all over each
other.  After the hailstorm of bullets subside, Darnell and company
make their exit.</P>
<P>     Darnell runs square into rule number one when robbing banks.  If
you rob a bank, do not have initials carved into your hairdo.  Cops
like hints like that.  Remember, those little video cameras aren't
there for nothing.</P>
<P>     "What's the proper procedure for dealing with this situation?"
asks Detective Strode (John C. McGinley) about what Frankie should have
done in the stickup.  Blood splattered Frankie does not pass this
kangaroo court in her boss's office after the robbery so he fires her
on the spot.  This is one of many contrived and unbelievable sequences.
Never does she think about complaining about her rights or threatening
to sue.</P>
<P>     Frankie takes a night job as a janitor along with her friends, a
tough lesbian named Cleo (Queen Latifah), a single mom named Tisean
(Kimberly Elise), and a woman named Stony (Jada Pinkett from THE NUTTY
PROFESSOR) who has a kid brother having problems getting into UCLA.
The women work in a huge and lavish office building full of chrome and
glass which is the exact opposite of the environment where they live.
They pick up the photos on the desks and ridicule the workers there as
having it so much easier that they do.  One woman in the picture, for
example, they say clearly doesn't wash any dishes.</P>
<P>     These woman have problems with everyone.  Their manager at
Luther's Janitorial Service promised them under the table money but
reneges on the deal rationalizing it with, "There are three people in
this world I don't mess with: the I., the R., and the S."  After this,
one of them goes back to the projects to rent her body to raise cash.</P>
<P>     One day, on top of a roof while drinking from open bottles and
smoking dope, they concoct their big scheme.  "If crackhead Darnell can
rob a bank, we can."  From there, the film takes fairly standard twists
and turns.  It includes scenes of police circling the wrong black man
and viciously mowing him down with automatic weapons.  The part is
lifted straight out of the ending sequence of BONNIE AND CYLDE.</P>
<P>     SET IT OFF has potential.  These women have real problems, but
director F. Gary Gray goes for exploitation so much that the audience
is left with only the action to enjoy.  I suppose people who like
hating cops or one of the ethnic groups in the show might also gain
some vicarious pleasure since everyone is shown in a bad light.  In a
time when the country should be trying to come together, I found this
picture to be a celebration of our divisions.  Sad.</P>
<P>     SET IT OFF runs a full 2:00 for no good reason.  It is rated R for
very graphic violence, bad language, sex, and drug usage.  I would just
as soon no one saw the picture, but if teenagers go, they should be
quite mature.  I did not like the film and do not recommend it.  I give
this mean spirited film a single *.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = One of the top few films of this or any year.  A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.  Totally unbearable.</PRE>
