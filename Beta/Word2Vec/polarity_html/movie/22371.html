<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>I only know for sure that this is a revenge type of film and that it
plays much like many a classical Western, but is shot in the '60s style
of "Point Blank," and is scripted by Lem Dobbs, most probably, for the
entertainment value it provides. I also know that a limey is a slang
term for a Brit and that he is played with a bravura performance by
Terence Stamp. Stamp is so good here, with his fiery blue eyes,
intimidating tone, and hollowed cheekbones jutting out from his intense
face, playing an ex-con who we only know as Wilson and who is 60-
years-old and just got out of the can in England after doing 9-years for
armed robbery. We see him on a plane from London to Los Angeles to find
out how his daughter Jenny (Melissa) died while he was away, not
believing for one moment her death was a result of a car accident.</P>
<P>The story frequently goes from what he is thinking to some flashback to
some future thing he wants to do, therefore the time sequence is often
confusing. But what remains riveting is the single-minded purpose he
has, as he tries to understand what happened to his daughter through his
conversations with two of her friends, the middle-aged acting coach for
his daughter, Elaine (Warren), who tells him, his daughter says she
considered her father to be a ghost in her life, and the burly, heavily
tattooed Mexican-American, Eddie (Guzman), who felt sorry for her, and
as an ex-con himself, identified with Wilson, therefore he writes Wilson
in prison about her death. Wilson also tries to find out what happened
to his daughter through a trucking business that is gangster operated,
and the conversation with the surly men there takes a more violent turn,
resulting in the typical crime film rub out scene. The only thing of
interest, is that you have this elderly guy going after these younger
hoods, and you can't help feeling that when he kills them, that they got
what they deserved.</P>
<P>If there is supposed to be a deeper meaning than revenge in this very
titillating feature, it is hard to say what that deeper meaning is,
unless from all the garbled Cockney sayings by Wilson, this is a film
about what the meaning of one's life is, as a senior citizen who had
plenty of time by himself to give the question adequate thought, as we
see that he from time-to-time reflects on that subject.</P>
<P>In any case, this film seems to be all style and that style is wonderful
to behold. It is also a film about nostalgia, as it brings back haunting
memories of a time that was intermixed with hope and confusion. The '60s
are dismissed here, as only being what happened in 1966- and early '67,
and that golden "hippie" age is further reduced to a few golden moments
of feeling free through the promising new music arriving on the scene.
At least, this is the view of Peter Fonda, who plays Terry Valentine, a
wealthy rock music promoter, the supposed reason for Wilson coming to
America, as he was Jenny's boyfriend when she died and is his prime
suspect as her killer. Fonda is the slick manipulator of the times, who
now has a few palatial homes and enough money to be thought of as a
big-time operator, though there seems to be some trouble in his
paradise, as he is laundering dirty money for drug dealers and is
constantly looking over his shoulder at what trouble lies ahead. He is
very convincing as a slime-ball, and I liked peeking into his closet,
which is bigger than most people's apartments, with all those shoes and
sweaters, and I shouldn't forget that splendid pool and that panoramic
view his ultra-modern house has from the top of the Los Angeles hills,
indicating that he is someone who is doing very well.</P>
<P>Steven Sodergergh (Sex, Lies, and Videotape/Kafka/Schizopolis/Out of
Sight) has a way of making quirky films that border on the mundane but
offer promises of much more. In this film he engages several intriguing
possibilities and plays them out to the hilt: he has his two major
stars, Fonda and Stamp, who were both born in 1939 and both played
innocent anti-hero types in the '60s, Fonda, as the biker drug dealer in
"Easy Rider" and Stamp, in "Billy Budd," be pitted against each other.
In addition, Stamp had a role in 1967 as a thief called Wilson in the
first feature by Ken Loach, "Poor Cow". These byplays to the film add
some questions to what went wrong with the '60s, as it seems to ask in
the film, how does Wilson end up doing hard time in prison robbing the
ticket office of a rock concert while Valentine remains stuck in a time
warp making big money by still packaging that same music, still going
after beautiful young girls, this time replacing Jenny with another
live-in beauty, Adhara (Amelia), and crossing the line of innocence in
drugs by becoming a party to the big-time criminal aspect of the drug
business, as money is his lure and no other pretences of becoming a
better person is given. The director makes frequent flashback cuts to
the Stamp of younger film days, using the 1967 film he was in, as it
becomes more and more evident that this film has many purposes to it,
not excluding the former real-life film roles of its present iconic
stars and how they are now portrayed onscreen.</P>
<P>As Wilson and Valentine square off with each other, through Wilson's
bitter way of looking at him, we get to view his take on Valentine's
Hollywood lifestyle, as he visits him in his Los Angeles canyon home and
meets his entourage full blast. The first one he meets, is his shady
lawyer adviser who is paid to protect him from the unseemly side to his
business, Barry Newman as the 60ish Avery, who plays his role as a
villain with an intractable mind-set. His first attempt to get Wilson
removed from the party results in his security man being fatally thrown
down the canyon by the limey. There is also a colorful hitman that Avery
hires to get Wilson, Stacy (Katt), someone in love with his image of
being a hitman, who has the funniest joke in the film, that is tasteless
and irresistible: "What is the smartest thing to come out of a woman's
mouth?" Answer. "Einstein's cock."</P>
<P>The filmgoer gets a lot for his price of admission here: a great
performance by the actors, a pleasing revenge film with all the usual
action sequences and a twist in the plot to keep the viewer further
enthralled, it's a film that has all the techniques of the French New
Wave filming style, with jump cuts and a fast-moving camera to keep the
viewer guessing what's coming next as he is kept adequately confused so
that he thinks he is missing something and should see the film again,
and the viewer also gets the promise that this baby has something wise
to say, which it appears to be on the verge of saying at times; but, I
would say, it is safer to believe that this film is style over
substance, and in this case, that is not all that bad. Perhaps, the '60s
itself was mostly an innocent call for a better world that was
manipulated by those who knew better, like the Terry Valentine's of the
world. Therefore style over substance isn't all that bad a message for
this intensely shot nouveau-noir work, that seemed to be saying
something like that or maybe it's just that the king's English, even
when spoken by a common criminal in a rich Cockney accent, sounds so
worthwhile, that I have been so duly conditioned to believe that about
the English language, that I would listen keenly to anyone who spoke
like that and believe I was listening to something philosophical.</P>
