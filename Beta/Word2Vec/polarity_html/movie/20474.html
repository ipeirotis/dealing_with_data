<P>SPANISH PRISONER, THE (director/writer: David Mamet; cinematographer:
Gabriel Beristain; cast: Campbell Scott (Joe Ross), Rebecca Pidgeon (Susan
Ricci), Steve Martin (Jimmy Dell), Ben Gazzara (Klein), Felicity Huffman
(Pat McCune), Ricky Jay (George Lang), 1998)</P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A great labyrinth plot, ala Hitchcock, as Mamet delves into the greedy
corporate world and its nasty secrets of espionage and bitter
competition, and dangles this world in front of us, with all its perks
and glitter and hopes for money being the big payoff for these corporate
types. This nearly perfectly executed film, never fails to surprise and
it accomplishes this by telling an old-fashioned story without one
explicit sex scene or one single curse word, earning it a PG rating. The
chink in the story's armor is, when you see how it ends, you realize it
doesn't add up. The fun seems to be in the telling of the story and not
in the story itself making sense.</P>
<P>This is a masterfully crafted thriller for the '90s and its new values
and lingo. Steve Martin (that's right, pal) steals the film with his
stellar performance mixing affable charm and dark mystery to hide his
persona. The film's theme incorporates how corrupting the corporate
world is for a boy scout like Joe Ross (Campbell), who invented 'The
Process,' and just wants what is his, what he earned by the sweat of his
brow. This something, 'The Process,' is what should put him figuratively
on 'easy street.' 'The Process' is a McGuffin, a Hitchcock invented
term, it is something to focus your attention on without knowing what it
really is. Its explanation for the movie is that it has something to do
with a formula that can control the global market. But what Mamet really
is showing, is greed and how that poisonous desire makes the world spin.
This is pointed out when the board members of a company want to know how
much they will earn from investing in it and Joe writes the supposed
astronomical figure on a blackboard, which the audience is not
privileged to see but is supposed to be impressed by it through the
response taken from watching the widening eyes of the board members.</P>
<P>Joe's boss, Klein (Gazzara), plays him along without telling him how
much he will receive for his invention, which is making Joe quite antsy.
While on a business trip to a fictitious Caribbean island that is
supposed to be for the wealthy and Japanese honeymooners, Joe Ross meets
a couple of folks on this island who will alter his life. One is a woman
who says she is an F.B.I. agent (Felicity). The other is the mysterious
rich man Jimmy Dell (Martin), who is seen departing from a boat and
could have also come off a seaplane, when Joe takes a snapshot of him
and the girl he is with. Dell offers to buy the camera for a $1,000, but
when Joe just gives the camera to him and turns down the money, a
friendship starts.</P>
<P>The story twists and turns, as Dell and Joe make plans to meet back in
NYC, with the innocent hero dropping off a package to Dell's attractive
sister, who Dell shows him a photo of to lure him into making sure they
meet again. Joe is like those heroes in '50s noir films who find
themselves alone, fighting both the system and the criminal world. After
meeting with Dell and being duped into opening a Swiss bank account and
being made a member of a phony diner club, and having his world turned
upside down, as he gets involved in things that he doesn't understand,
he is left confused and unsure of what viable choices he has left, as
his pride is hurt that he has been taken for a sucker. He is being
wrongly accused of a crime and not being able to find anyone to trust,
except for his friend and company lawyer, Ricky (Lang). But he is found
dead in his room, leaving Joe once again isolated and afraid. This pulls
him very close to the audience, as they identify with him and his
situation, even if it is hardly possible that they themselves would ever
be in such a position.</P>
<P>This is the kind of hero that speaks realistically to what could happen
to anyone in today's work place, especially to someone who doesn't play
the corporate game, and who doesn't know that the first axiom in
business for the dishonest types, is always do business as if someone is
trying to screw you. So, when he reluctantly teams up with Susan Ricci
(Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife), who is the new secretary in his firm,
the audience can understand this weakness in him, which is viewed as the
kindness he shows to others. This stance he has, as the outsider who
made good in a world where the odds are stacked against him, but is now
having the rug pulled out from under him, makes him begin to be
uncertain of everything, as he begins to lose trust in people. And as he
wants to be a believer in people, he is drawn to Ricci, seeing in her
someone who has a crush on him, and even though he is not attracted to
her, he needs to confide in someone in whom he can trust and she seems
to be giving him sound advice.</P>
<P>There is no point in giving away the story; that is, except to mention
that "The Spanish Prisoner" refers to a scam. Mamet tells us it is the
oldest scam in the books. In this film, it has nothing to do with Spain
or a prisoner.</P>
<P>This tale is more frightening than a hundred action films put together.
It is eerie because the innocent hero asks, during one of his low
points, "Why steal what others worked for?"
Mamet offers a naive plea for the corrupting influences of big business
to stop their venal behavior, as he wonders why those who play fair
always get eaten up by those who don't.</P>
<P>It is a film that earnestly asks, `Why is it that nobody in this world
is what they seem?'</P>
<P>And that is a question we can all relate to in one way or another, as we
are led along the same blind alleys Joe is, seeing the same things he
sees, wondering if this Kafkaesque nightmare has a light at the end of
the tunnel.</P>
<P>Has Mamet really ended the film by tying up all the loose ends and
leaving us with the kind of ending we as an audience wanted?</P>
<P>And the answer is... Maybe. This is a film for people who like to use
their noodle and are able to appreciate films that can't be tidied up so
easily. Even the so-called tidy ending here might not be as tidy as it
first appears, if you look carefully you will spot some loose ends.</P>
