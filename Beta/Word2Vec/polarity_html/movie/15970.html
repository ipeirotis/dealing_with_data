<P>After hearing reviews for Woody Allen's upteenth movie in history,
"Celebrity," range from terribly boring to just so-so, my heart lept
when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of
"Manhattan," my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of
all time.  Woody Allen's films almost never rely on visual flair over
textual flair, so when one of his films closely resembles the one time
that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ("Manhattan" really is one of
the best-looking films I've ever seen, beautiful black and white
photography of the city's best areas, etc.), a fan can't help but feel
visibly moved.  The film opens up, with the usual credits with plain
white font over black backgrounds, and an old ironic standard playing on
the soundtrack, but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky,
with the word "Help" being spelled with an airplane.  Beethoven's 5th
blasts on the soundtrack.  The city seems to stop to take notice of this
moment, and it's all rather lovely to look at.</P>
<P>And then we cut to a film crew, shooting this as the film's hilariously
banal key moment in the film, where the lead actress in the film
(Melanie Griffith, looking as buxom and beautiful as ever) has to
realize something's wrong with her life or whatever.  It's a terribly
stale scene for a Woody Allen film, with the great opening shots or
without, and my heart sank and I soon got used to the fact that once
again, a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works
(though, for the record, last year's "Deconstructing Harry" came awfully
close).</P>
<P>What the hell has happened to him?  The man who once could be relied on
for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny, but his
films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together
out of unfinished ideas.  "Bullets Over Broadway," though wonderful,
relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off.
"Mighty Aphrodite" is more full of great moments and lines than a really
great story.  "Everyone Says I Love You" was more of a great idea than a
great film.  Even "Deconstructing Harry" is admittingly cheap in a way,
even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films.</P>
<P>If anything, the reception of "Celebrity" by everyone should tip Allen
off to the fact that this time, it's not the audience and critics who
are wrong about how wonderful his film is: it's him.  "Celebrity" is,
yes, a good film, but it's only marginally satisfying as a Woody Allen
film.  Instead of creating the great Woody Allen world, he's created a
world out of a subject he knows only a bit about.  And he's fashioned a
film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of
celebrities, so that it plays like a series of skits with minor
connections.  It's like "La Dolce Vita" without the accuracy, the right
amount of wit, and the correct personal crisis.</P>
<P>Woody, becoming more insecure in his old age, choses to drop the Woody
Allen character in on the world of celebrities, and then hang him and
all his flaws up for scrutiny, and does this by casting not himself but
Brit actor Kenneth Branagh in the lead.  Much has been said about his
performance - dead on but irritating, makes one yearn for the real
thing, blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the Woody Allen
character knows that Branagh's performance, though featuring some of the
same mannerisms (stuttering, whining, lots o' hand gestures), is hardly
a warts-and-all impersonation.  Branagh brings along with him little of
the Woody Allen charm, which actually allows for his character's flaws
to be more apparent.  Woody's a flawed guy, and we know it, but we love
him anyway, because he's really funny and really witty and really
intelligent.  Branagh's Allen is a bit more flat-out bad, but with the
same charm so that, yes, we like him, but we're still not sure if he's
really a good person or not.</P>
<P>His character, Lee Simon, is first seen on the set of the aforementioned
movie, hits on extra actress Winona Ryder, then goes off to interview
Griffith, who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at
her, and she denies him...sorta.  We then learn, through flashbacks,
that Lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a
mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion.  He has
since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist
of sorts, covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate,
so that he can meet them, and maybe sell his script (a bank robbery
movie "but with a deep personal crisis").  As such, he has divorced his
wife of several years (Allen regular Judy Davis), and continues on a
quest for sexual happiness, boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and
fling to fling over the course of the film.</P>
<P>After Griffith comes his escapades with a model (Charlize Theron) who is
"polymorphously perverse" (glad to see Allen is using new jokes, ha ha),
who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the Anita
Ekberg segment of "La Dolce Vita."  Following are his safe relationship
with smart working woman Famke Janssen, a relationship that almost
assures him success, and his continued escapades with Ryder, whom he
fancies most of all.  His story is juxtaposed with that of Davis, who
flips out, but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome,
friendly TV exec (Joe Mantegna) who lands her a job that furthers her
career to national status.  While Lee is fumbling about, selfishly
trying to ensure his own happiness, Davis becomes happy ("I've become
the kind of woman I've always hated...and I'm loving it.") without doing
a thing.</P>
<P>The result is a film of highs and mediums.  The mediums are what take up
most of the film, with sitations and scenes which don't exactly work but
you can't help but pat Allen on the back for trying.  But other places
are really great scenes.  The opening.  The sequence with Theron, which
is so good that I wished it hadn't ended.  A banana scene with Bebe
Neuwirth (droll as ever).  And, perhaps the best sequence: a romp with
hot-as-hell teen idol, Brandon Darrow, played by none other than Leo
DiCaprio, who is so un-DiCaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit
through this film, they'd never look at him the same way.  He ignites
the screen with intensity, and spares nothing in showing his character
as narcissistically tyrannical, and totally heartbreaking for Lee, who
comes to him to talk about his script that he has read, and finds
himself on a wild all-day ride with him.  They go to Atlantic City to
watch a fight, they gamble, and they wind up in his hotel room, where
Darrow gets it on with his flame (Gretchen Mol) and he lends him one of
the leftover groupies.  Allen's writing in these scenes are so good that
just for them, I'd almost recommend the film.  Almost.</P>
<P>But what I really liked about this film is despite the fact that it's a
mess, despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old
fashioned rewrite by Allen himself, it's still a smart and insightful
film.  Though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced (some seem
too cartoonish, even for this environment), Allen still manages to get
across that this film is not exactly about celebrities, as it may seem
to be (if it were, it'd be extremely out-of-touch), but about those who
want to be celebrities, and how they equate celebrity-hood with
happiness.  We never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see
if they're really happy (they may appear to be on the surface...), but
we do get close enough to Lee and Davis' character.  Lee is obsessed
with the phenomenon, while Davis takes is at arm's length, and never
gets too involved in what it is, and soon becomes one herself.</P>
<P>Besides, it's witty, and it does have the one thing that no other film
has but Allen's: that great Woody Allen feel.  It may be not exactly
fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject,
and yes, as a part of Woody Allen's oeuvre, it's merely a blip (no
"Annie Hall" but it's no "Shadows and Fog" either), but it goes to prove
that no one can make a film like him, and only he and maybe Godard could
possibly take a totally horrible metaphor, like the one in the
beginning, and make it work not once but twice.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
