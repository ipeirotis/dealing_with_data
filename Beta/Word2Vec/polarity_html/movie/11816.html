<P>     The film may be called MERCURY RISING, but that title doesn't 
describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture, a routine thriller 
that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated 
buddy story.  The "hook" that is supposed to make MERCURY RISING unique 
is that the young protagonist is autistic.  However, aside from giving 
actor Miko Hughes a chance to win raves for his performance, this 
particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a 
convenient plot device.  Those expecting to see even a semi-thorough 
exploration of the condition will be disappointed.  MERCURY RISING 
treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action 
thrillers accord to alcoholism.</P>
<P>     The script for MERCURY RISING is exceptionally tiresome and hard-
to-swallow.  I don't know whether the problem is in the original book, 
SIMPLE SIMON, or in the screenplay adaptation, but this movie easily 
exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief 
is no longer possible.  Once again, certain standby plot elements -- the 
high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent 
-- are recycled, and not to good effect.  While Bruce Willis can play 
the action hero as well as anyone in Hollywood, this particular outing 
leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little 
tension and too much nonsense.</P>
<P>     The story begins with a formulaic sequence in which The Tough FBI 
Agent with a Heart of Gold, Art Jeffries (Bruce Willis), is confronted 
with his own failure.  Unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time, he is 
forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death.  The event weighs 
heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation 
for protecting 9-year old Simon Lynch (Miko Hughes) when he discovers 
the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned 
down by The Evil Hit Man Who Looks Like an Ex-Football Player.  Soon, 
Art and Simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for 
their lives and bonding at the same time, with The Evil Hit Man Who 
Looks Like an Ex-Football Player always just a step behind them.  Along 
the way, they are helped by The Best Friend Who Defies Orders to Help 
Out His Buddy (Chi McBride) and the Supporting Female Who May or May Not 
Become a Love Interest (Kim Dickens).  </P>
<P>     Why is Simon in danger and why were his parents turned into Swiss 
cheese by The Evil Hit Man Who Looks Like an Ex-Football Player?  
Apparently, the government has spent millions of dollars developing an 
ultra-secret code called "Mercury."  To make sure it can't be cracked, 
they do the most intuitive thing possible:  place a sample of it in a 
"nerds' puzzle magazine."  Of course, no one can solve it -- no one 
except autistic Simon, that is.  When he calls the phone number listed 
in the solution, he gets the NSA.  As a result, The Cold-Hearted, 
Sneering Government Man (Alec Baldwin) decides that Simon has to be 
eliminated -- for the good of the country, of course.  But he hasn't 
counted on The Tough FBI Agent with a Heart of Gold, even though 
everyone in the audience has.</P>
<P>     It's hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn't do 
anything exceptionally well, and does quite a few things rather poorly.  
For those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like, 
MERCURY RISING manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time, but 
even the most exciting scenes (such as the one where Art and Simon are 
crouched down, avoiding passing trains) aren't that pulse-pounding.  The 
climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that 
is painful in its obviousness.  Overall, director Harold Becker is 
constantly struggling (and failing) to generate even a moment that isn't 
derivative or obligatory.</P>
<P>     Bruce Willis' star seems to be fading.  This is his fourth straight 
lackluster outing, following LAST MAN STANDING, THE FIFTH ELEMENT, and 
THE JACKAL.  Willis isn't terrible, but this is the kind of role he can 
sleepwalk through, and often does.  Alec Baldwin, combining elements of 
his characters from GLENGARRY GLENN ROSS and MALICE, does some scenery-
chewing, but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace.  The 
film's real star is young Miko Hughes (Heather Langenkamp's son in WES 
CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE), who does as good a job as Dustin Hoffman 
playing an autistic individual, but is about 50 years younger.  </P>
<P>     MERCURY RISING joins the likes of HARD RAIN, THE REPLACEMENT 
KILLERS, and U.S. MARSHALS on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers.  For 
those who like action and adventure in the theater, this has not been a 
good year.  Hopefully, the advent of summer will change that.  Until 
then, the best choices (for Bruce Willis or any other action hero) are 
on video.  And, if you're determined to see Mercury rising, check out 
the morning sky in early May.</P>
