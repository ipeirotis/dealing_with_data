<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This updated 210-minute version of Wolfgang Petersen's Das Boot WW11
U-boat thriller, adapted from the semi-autobiography of someone who
served on a submarine during the war, Lothar-Gunther Buchheim, humanizes
the Germans and shows the sweaty conditions that they had to fight
under. This is the director's cut, where he added 65 minutes to the the
most expensive German film ever made at the time ($40 million is the
reputed pricetag), which was originally a six-hour TV miniseries. It
sets a high standard for submarine films, as a well-crafted, serious
work, that created a lot of nail-biting tension and evoked a suspenseful
atmosphere, and might very well be the best submarine film ever made.
Wolfgang Petersen was nominated but did not win an Oscar for his
directing. It also gave the director a chance to come to Hollywood to
show off his ability to shoot action films, where he made "In the Line
of Fire"/"Air Force One"/ "Perfect Storm." Das Boot was one of the most
popular foreign films in America at the time, and is still doing very
well in its video rentals.</P>
<P>There were 40,000 Germans who served on U-boats during the war and
30,000 of them never returned. It was the U-boats mission to guard the
North Atlantic and make sure no boats got through. The British
supply-ships were trying to get through the German blockades, as the 12
German U-boats on patrol tried to stop them. The ships were escorted by
destroyers and were sometimes protected by airplanes. Winston Churchill
was mocked by the Nazi propaganda machine as a paralytic drunkard, but
those who fought the British knew better and respected their efficiency
on the sea.</P>
<P>The film is about U-96's mission in 1941 and its veteran, stoic captain
(Jurgen Prochnow), who is a career military man and is none too pleased
with Hitler's battle plans or with the wet-behind-the-ears youngsters
who make up his crew. He feels Hitler is sending him out on a
"Children's Crusade." The tone of the film is more antiestablishment
than antiwar, as the captain bitches with his other officers about the
stupidity of the war effort by the German High Command. When an
eager-beaver Lieutenant (Hubertus Bengsch), with a rigid jaw, spouts the
Nazi beliefs, the captain ridicules his blind devotion to such ideals,
saying he's the type who would march to hell for the Fuehrer.</P>
<P>The film opens with the boat refueling at the French base of La Rochelle
used by the Nazis as their submarine station. The captain escorts, Lt.
Werner (Gronemeyer), a young naval war correspondent just assigned to
his boat to write public relations stories about the crew, making them
into heroes for the Germans to read about back home, as they head to
where the bar the men on shore leave are at. They are letting off steam,
getting drunk, taking up with whores, and hiding their fear with false
bravado and loud songs. The captain engages another veteran U-boat
captain (Otto Sander), who has just been militarily honored, but is too
drunk to make a coherent speech at the bar. There seems to be an
understanding between these two about what the war means: that they do a
good job and not get caught up in the politics. These two crusty seamen
are not Nazis, but are German patriots and professional military men.</P>
<P>Aboard the cramped ship, that is so claustrophobic, that when the men
have to pass an officer, they must say, "permission to pass," as they
squeeze by the narrow opening. The quarters are very tight, as the men
sleep crowded together; it seems as if they are trapped in a prison. The
film exploits their discomfort and their boredom to show that war is a
dreary life for the submarine crew and not filled with excitement. The
crew seems anxious to get some action just to break up the boredom. They
all have different ways of relieving their tension. One of the men
(Martin May) writes letters to a French girl he met in Paris, whom he
got secretly engaged to and is worried that she is pregnant, and that
the Partisans will kill the child. The Chief Engineer (Klaus Wennemann)
keeps the submarine running as best as he can. The 2nd Lieutenant
(Martin Semmelrogge) is the comic in the group, which comes mostly at
the expense of the captain.</P>
<P>The war correspondent is told by the captain to take pictures of the
men, not now when they are baby-faced but when they return as men with
beards. The journalist forms a bond with the captain, who explains to
him what he is doing and thusly clues us in to how the submarine
operates.</P>
<P>The main action takes place when the U-boat attacks a British convoy of
five and torpedoes three of its ships. The tension on the boat is
intense, as the dark ship becomes completely quiet, as they are being
hunted by a destroyer above them, which drops depth charges and the men
anxiously wait below to see if they will survive. It is a matter of luck
that their boat escapes.</P>
<P>The most eerie scene, is when the U-boat surfaces and the beautiful sky
looks darkly serene, but the tankers they hit are on fire and we could
hear the screams of the sailors for help, as they go diving into the
water with their body's covered in flames. But the captain orders
another torpedo at them and ignores their pleas. His only reaction, was
one of surprise that they were still on board, that no one rescued them.</P>
<P>That was an amazing scene. I couldn't imagine a Hollywood film showing
Americans not rescuing drowning seamen, even if their submarine had no
room for the prisoners.</P>
<P>What this excellently told story fails to do, is come to terms with the
political situation or the moral implications of the war. It is seen
best as a film that is technically superb, drawing out the reality of
what it is like to be on the submarine and showing how terrible it is to
go to war. The boat constructed by Rolf Zehetbauer and Götz Weidner,
which duplicates the cramped boat down to its grimy details, and
provides the film with the proper setting for its intense realism.</P>
<P>The superb use of sound, helped elevate this film above all other
submarine films, as every sound in the quiet of the submarine is heard:
the splashing against a destroyer's propellers, the eerie ping sounds,
the bellowing roar of a depth charge, and the creaks of a hull.</P>
<P>Jurgen Prochnow's sterling performance gave the film the quiet hero it
needed to anchor its story, as his will to fight, his intelligent
leadership, and his quiet determinism to fight a glorious war, were
nobly shown, as the men under him completely respected him. The crew was
made up of sympathetic figures and not cardboard Nazis most WW11 films
seen from an American perspective portray onscreen for the Germans.</P>
<P>In one scene the captain is disappointed that his man in the galley
(Erwin Leder), who is a diesel engine operator, a veteran of nine battle
campaigns, has an attack of nerves and cracks, refusing to report to his
battle station. When the man recovers the next day, he begs the captain
not to court-martial him. The pain on the captain's face is clear, as he
tells the seaman to go get some rest. What the film seemed to be aiming
at, was not a big statement against war, but how the captain was a
professional and treated his men accordingly, expecting them to do their
best no matter what. As for the German leaders, he openly showed a
disdain, not for their politics, but because they didn't know how to run
a war.</P>
<P>The film ends as the damaged U-boat escapes by running silent after a
deep dive in the Straits of Gibraltar, as the men must put on their
oxygen masks to survive in their damaged boat. There is also an ironical
ending for the men as they come back to port. The film succeeds in
humanizing the men in this mostly true story, as it highlights the crew
when it is singing their favorite song, "It's a Long Way to Tipperary,"
and that's the most vocal this very quiet, very emotionally gripping,
and very entertaining film will get about anything. The captain and his
crew know that the odds weigh heavily against them returning from a
mission alive, and such life and death missions have their psychological
consequences.</P>
