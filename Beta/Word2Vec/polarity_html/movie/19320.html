<P>     THIS IS MY FATHER is a family affair, and not just because its
subject matter involves family ties.  The writer/director is Paul Quinn,
brother of star Aidan Quinn, both of whom are also brothers to
cinematographer Declan Quinn, with all three acting as executive
producers.  It must have seemed a warm and wonderful thing for the
brothers Quinn to collaborate on a tale of their homeland, a paean to the
importance of finding one's roots combined with the rich atmosphere of
1930s Ireland.  So warm and wonderful was the experience, evidently, that
no one bothered to pay much attention to telling an interesting, coherent
story.  </P>
<P>     THIS IS MY FATHER is a sprawling mess of a film that tries to tell
several stories, each one more irritating than the last.  The narrative
opens in the present day, where Chicago high school teacher Kieran Johnson
(James Caan) is experiencing some sort of existential crisis.  When he
finds a photo and note from a man named Kieran among his invalid mother's
possessions, he connects that malaise to never knowing his father.  With
his vaguely sullen nephew Jack (Jacob Tierney) in tow, Kieran travels to
his mother's Irish hometown, where an elderly resident (Moira Deady) spins
him a tale circa 1939.  In that tale, Kieran's mother Fiona Flynn (Moya
Farrelly) is a high-spirited 17-year-old who catches the eye of shy farmer
Kieran O'Day (Aidan Quinn).  The pairing causes trouble in the town, of
course, as religion and family objections come between Fiona and Kieran
the elder.</P>
<P>     The trouble begins in THIS IS MY FATHER with a present-day prologue
that does a miserable job of setting up the premise.  In fact, the entire
framing story feels like little more than a series of ridiculous
contrivances.  Caan's monotonously shellshocked performance offers little
indication as to what his problem is, how long it's been going on, or how
it's connected to his equally shellshocked sister and ill mother.  The
addition of fatherless young Jack to the travelling party seems intended
to provide a contemporary parallel as his own youthful romance blossoms.
Unfortunately, that romance is so ridiculously apocryphal that it's not
clear until the last ten minutes which of two girls is supposed to be his
own lovely lass.  Every moment set in the present is a wearying bore,
leading this viewer to a stone-faced demand that the flashback sequences
better be worth it.</P>
<P>     They're not.  They're an improvement, to be certain, but there's so
much extraneous business going on that the central romance gets lost.
Strewn throughout the tale are a couple of curses, the omnipresent
institutional frown of the Catholic Church (including a nicely creepy
role for Stephen Rea as a fire-and-brimstone priest), a bit of class
warfare, and a cameo appearance by John Cusack as an American photographer
who lands his plane to play American football with Kieran and Fiona on a
beach, take the picture which will end up in Kieran the younger's hands,
and go away.  The romance itself ultimately makes no sense from Fiona's
side, with nary an attempt to explain why the spunky girl would be charmed
by the socially inept Kieran.  Aidan Quinn fares better as a man-child
unsure how to handle a romantic relationship, but the story places too
much tragic weight on his shoulders.  THIS IS MY FATHER wanders all over
the Emerald Isle in search of a compelling theme or relationship, and
never finds one.</P>
<P>     I suppose the Quinns may have been pointing out the generational
consequences of fatherlessness through Kieran O'Day (orphaned), Fiona
(child of a widow), Kieran Johnson and Jack (both with absentee fathers).
They may have been most interested in re-creating the sights and sounds of
1939 Ireland.  They may have wanted to make their own TITANIC-lite
romantic weeper, complete with Celtic music.  The problem is that you
really can't tell what they wanted to do with any degree of certainty.
THIS IS MY FATHER never pulls its two storylines together in any
believable way, nor manages to make either one gripping on its own terms.
The filming may have served as a pleasant, roots-exploring Quinn family
vacation, but we the viewers are left with the tedium of watching their
home movies.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 dead Eires:  3.</PRE>
