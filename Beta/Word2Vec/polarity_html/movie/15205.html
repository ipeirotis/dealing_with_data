<P>     I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER seems like exactly the kind of
film at which SCREAM and SCREAM 2 took their satiric jabs.  In this sequel
to last fall's horror hit, Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is still
traumatized after surviving a killing spree by a gortex-clad, hook-handed,
vengeance-minded psycho (Muse Watson).  A year after the events in the
first film, she's terrorized again -- this time on a tropical holiday with
her college roommate Karla (Brandy), Karla's boyfriend Tyrell (Mekhi
Phifer) and a classmate named Will (Matthew Settle) with a crush on Julie
-- in all the expected ways.  People begin dying in reverse credits order.
Shadowy figures flit across the background.  Small creatures dart out to
the accompaniment of blasts of music.  The electricity goes out.  The
killer moves...very...slowly towards potential victims.  And no matter how
violently the killer meets his apparent demise, he always turns up to
suggest yet another sequel.</P>
<P>     Aside from its chronologically-challenged title -- if this is
happening a year after the first film, shouldn't it be I STILL KNOW WHAT
YOU DID TWO SUMMERS AGO? -- I STILL KNOW SHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is
constructed with an almost benign predictablity.  Yet in a way, that's the
appeal of the teen horror film.  There's nothing truly scary about the
film, nor was there ever intended to be.  It's a Halloween funhouse with
spaghetti for intestines and peeled grapes for human eyeballs.  There's
nothing dehumanizing about the way characters are gleefully dispatched,
because they're never meant to be any more human than a mannequin being
decapitated.  You scream because it's what you're supposed to do, and you
laugh about it afterwards.</P>
<P>     That doesn't make it any more fun for the average viewer of voting
age to watch a film where you can identify every twist or turn several
minutes before it happens.  This is the kind of film you go to for only
one reason:  you're a teenager, you're on a date, and you're ready for an
excuse to grip someone tightly.  You're not going for the chance to see
Jeffrey Combs' demented turn as a hotel manager with an attitude.  You're
not going to care about the inane attempts to give our protagonists actual
personalities.  You're certainly not going to care about the silly
dialogue, or the less-than-terrifying prospect of Julie becoming an
ultraviolet McNugget while locked into a tanning bed.  You'll pay your
money for a hug and a shriek, and you'll get exactly what you pay for.</P>
<P>     If I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER didn't feel as long as its
title by the time the credits finally roll, it might have warranted even
more slack.  After all, it's a genre film doing what a genre film is made
to do.  It's also a film which feels blasted into production on a shaky
premise with virtually no attempt at creating a quality product.  It might
seem strange to see a film like this after SCREAM turned its kind into
comic relief, but there's still an audience for this sort of grind-it-out
funhouse ride.  I'm not it, but you know who you are.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 endless summers:  4.</PRE>
