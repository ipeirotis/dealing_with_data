<P>     There have been two ACE VENTURA directors:  Tom Shadyac and Steve 
Oedekerk.  Shadyac, after helming the first (and better, although not by 
much) of the two pet detective outings, moved on to more amusing and 
less barren projects like THE NUTTY PROFESSOR and LIAR LIAR.  Oedekerk, 
on the other hand, hasn't directed in two years, and his return 
engagement, NOTHING TO LOSE, is hardly triumphant. </P>
<P>     The "moronic comedy" (a movie where people commit stupid acts with 
little regard for things like logic and credibility) is a motion picture 
staple, dating back to the silent era.  Once, film makers invested a 
great deal of creativity into these projects, but, these days, almost 
every entry into the genre is routine, formulaic, and of limited 
entertainment value.  As a result, watching films like NOTHING TO LOSE 
can be tedious.  The movie offers a few legitimate laughs, but there's 
not enough quality or quantity to support a ninety-minute production.  
In between the widely-spaced, effective gags, we're treated to a mind-
numbingly contrived script, inane dialogue, and flat characters.  </P>
<P>     NOTHING TO LOSE introduces us to Nick Beam (Tim Robbins), a mild-
mannered advertising company executive who, as the film demonstrates in 
an early scene, is involved in an apparently-perfect marriage with the 
gorgeous and bubbly Ann (Kelly Preston).  Then, on a day when Nick 
arrives home unexpectedly early, he makes a shocking discovery -- his 
wife in bed with his boss (Michael McKean).  Devastated, Nick gets in 
his car and drives into the seedier portions of Los Angeles, where he's 
car-jacked by Terrence (Martin Lawrence), a slick-talking thief.  That's 
where the revenge fantasy takes over, as Nick turns the tables on 
Terrence.  Instead of meekly handing over his wallet, Nick puts his foot 
on the gas and effectively kidnaps his would-be robber.  What follows is 
a variation on the standard, tired buddy movie concept, with a few car 
chases, shootouts, and mistaken identity subplots thrown in for good 
measure.  </P>
<P>     Had Oedekerk settled for a straight, mindless farce, things might 
have turned out okay.  Unfortunately, he makes the fatal mistake of 
attempting to inject an element of social commentary into NOTHING TO 
LOSE.  That's right -- social commentary in a movie that's as airheaded 
as they come.  Oedekerk is apparently on the pro-Affirmative Action 
bandwagon, since his semi-serious point is that White Corporate America 
is racist.  That statement may be accurate, but the writer/director 
chooses a poor arena in which to argue it.  Additionally, attempts to 
humanize Nick and Terrence fail as we're force-fed character-building 
moments that don't work on any level.</P>
<P>     Tim Robbins is better than the material.  It's to his credit that 
he's somehow able to generate sympathy for such a one-dimensional 
character.  Martin Lawrence, on the other hand, is playing the same guy 
he always plays:  Martin Lawrence.  It's an act that gets old quickly.  
After films like BOOMERANG, BAD BOYS, and A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND 
HATE, Lawrence has become overexposed (and I'm not even considering his 
recently-canceled TV series, which I haven't seen).  He's a personality 
with little discernible range, as NOTHING TO LOSE ably demonstrates.  
Meanwhile, the supporting cast, which includes Kelly Preston as Nick's 
wife, Michael McKean as his boss, and John C. McGinley and Giancarlo 
Esposito as a pair of bumbling crooks, is populated with unremarkable 
performers.  The only one who makes an impression is Irma B. Hall, who, 
playing Terrence's slap-happy mother, steals both of the short scenes 
she's in.</P>
<P>     Moments of inspired comedy are few and far between.  In addition to 
the Hall appearances, there's an amusing bit where Nick and Terrence 
compete to see who can be more frightening during a convenience store 
robbery.  Beyond that, the film offers the usual array of unfunny, 
repetitive attempts at humor.  NOTHING TO LOSE isn't so bad that it can 
be singled out as one of the worst movies of the summer, but there's 
nothing about this film to distinguish it from the many other sub-
mediocre non-entities currently in theaters. NOTHING TO LOSE promises to 
rob you of both time and money. </P>
