                       A film review by James Berardinelli

<P>     MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of one of
Shakespeare's better-known comedies.  Centered around two
romances--Hero (Kate Beckinsale) and Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard), and
Benedick (Kenneth Branagh) and Beatrice (Emma Thompson)--the story
follows these very different courtships.  For Hero and Claudio, it's
love at first sight and, as with any immediate attraction, they have a
lot to learn about each other.  Beatrice and Benedick, on the other
hand, have known each other for quite some time and it takes a little
none-too-subtle prodding from their friends to help them realize and
admit their feelings.</P>
<P>     With HENRY V, Kenneth Branagh made a stunning motion picture
directorial debut, setting the cinematic world on its collective ear
with a rendering of the story that many considered the equal of, if not
superior to, the legendary Laurence Olivier production.  Now, two films
(DEAD AGAIN and PETER'S FRIENDS) and four years later, Branagh has
again taken Shakespeare to his pinnacle.  If anything, MUCH ADO ABOUT
NOTHING is better than HENRY V.  If Branagh's place as one of today's
standout directors has not been assured before now, this will surely
clinch the position for him.</P>
<P>     For those who don't find Shakespeare's comedies funny (and it can
be something of a stretch to laugh when reading the lines in a book),
this is the film to see.  Simply put, the movie is hilarious.  It isn't
just the lines that create laughter, but the way Branagh has set them
up and the manner in which the actors deliver them.  Expressions and
actions often play a large part in the comedy, some of which is
decidedly physical.  These are the kinds of things that don't appear on
the written page.</P>
<P>     There's also a fair amount of drama in the film as well, and the
performers and director do as well with the serious stuff as they do
with the lighter material.  Pathos and poignancy come as easily and
naturally as humor.  Emotions run high in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, and
cover the spectrum from one end to the other.  Fortunately, everyone
involved is capable of upholding the pacing and tone that the film
demands to be successful.</P>
<P>     The life and vitality of this production are amazing.  Things move
along with a breezy energy that makes it impossible not to get caught
up in the experience.  I defy anyone, no matter how boring they find
the written Shakespeare, to fall asleep during this celebration.  Even
if everything else was low-key (which it definitely isn't), Patrick
Doyle's rousing score alone would be enough to keep many people's
attention.  MUCH ADO is one of the most engaging films I've seen in
years.  That I never once glanced at my watch is testimony enough of
how enraptured I was.</P>
<P>     While Branagh is not entirely faithful to the original text of
MUCH ADO, his film takes pains to capture the play's spirit.  Certain
(mostly small) elements of the source material have been excised, most
of which contain obscure references and jokes that a twentieth-century
audience would fail to either understand or find amusing.  Only
Shakespearean purists are likely to recognize the changes, however,
none of which are gross enough to cause outrage to the few who notice
their absence.  The majority of the audience will never know what's
missing, nor will they care.</P>
<P>     At first glance, some of the casting choices seem odd, to say the
least.  Regardless of how out-of-place certain names look, however,
even the least effective of the performers does a fine job.  No one who
appeared in MUCH ADO has anything to be ashamed of about the effort
they put into the film, or the result that appears on the screen.</P>
<P>     As might be expected, Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson turn out
sparkling, flawless performances.  Neither of them has done better
work.  Considering some of their past roles, that's high praise.  When
they are together, the chemistry is apparent.  It was one of the high
points of DEAD AGAIN and PETER'S FRIENDS, and that's true again here.
Branagh and Thompson are worthy contemporary rivals of any of the
silver screen's great husband-and-wife couples.</P>
<P>     It's refreshing to see Denzel Washington (as Don Pedro) playing in
a comedy.  This may not be his first, but it's his best.  With his
better-known roles coming in films like GLORY and MALCOLM X, it's good
to see Washington doing something lighter.  He fits in perfectly with
the rest of the cast, and race is never an issue.  Casting him might
have been one of Branagh's more daring moves in preparing this film.
Happily, it works.</P>
<P>     If there was to be a poor job done, one would expect it to come
from Keanu Reeves.  Surprisingly perhaps, he acquits himself well in an
admittedly small role (that of Don Pedro's bastard brother Don John,
the villain of the story).  There is fire in his eyes and his few lines
are delivered with cold ruthlessness.  On the other hand, Robert Sean
Leonard's range is occasionally stretched, but the hiccups in his
performance do nothing to damage the film.</P>
<P>     Veterans Richard Briers and Brian Blessed, along with newcomer
Kate Beckinsale, fill out the supporting roles with typical British
flair.  Michael Keaton is marvellous as the over-the-top Constable
Dogberry.  He's like something lifted from MONTY PYTHON, complete with
THE HOLY GRAIL's galloping around on a non-existent horse.</P>
<P>     MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is a gem of a movie--real find in 1993's
sea of mediocrity.  It's unfortunate that the film is unlikely to get a
general release, but if the nearest theater showing it is a little
further away than you normally travel, it's worth the trip.  Easily the
best film of the year to date, Kenneth Branagh's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
is also one of the most entertaining and scintillating motion pictures
to grace the screen in the past decade.</P>
