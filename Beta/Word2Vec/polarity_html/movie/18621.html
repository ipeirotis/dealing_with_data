<PRE>DEAD MAN ON CAMPUS
RATING: 4 / 10 --> This movie sucks</PRE>

<P>PLOT:
Upon the realization that they are failing all of their classes, two
roommates try to find a third roomie who will kill himself, since the
school's charter automatically grants top grades to the roommates of any
student who succeeds in suicide.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
Despite this film's interesting premise and dark subject matter, this movie
sucks because it is unfunny, boring, and presents us with one of Tom Everett
Scott's worst acting performances. Add that to a completely unsuccessful
romance element, many lame and corny jokes, a long wait for the setup, and
an ending that takes all the blackness out of this "black comedy" (If you're
gonna create a black comedy, don't chicken out in the end-see VERY BAD
THINGS (8/10) for a perfect example), and you've got yourself a trite MTV
creation worthy of its own subject matter. I barely laughed at any gags,
found the bong element contrived and repetitive, and was horrified NOT to
find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie (If you're gonna
make a bad College comedy, at least slap in some free T&A shots for the kids
:). This one's not even worth the rental, fellas. Skip it altogether!</P>
<P>Little Known Facts about this film and its stars:
During auditions for THAT THING YOU DO!, Tom Everett Scott's first feature
film role, director Tom Hanks was opposed to hiring Tom because of the fact
that Scott could've passed for Hanks 15 years ago. It wasn't until Hanks'
wife Rita Wilson saw the audition tape, and decided he was cute, that Hanks
decided to risk hiring Scott.
The actor who played Scott Cooper in this film, Mark-Paul Gosselaar, is best
known for having played the character of Zack Morris on TV's "Saved by the
Bell". His parents are Dutch and named Hans and Paula.
And who would've guessed that this is director Alan Cohn's first shot at
directing a feature film?</P>
