<P>     I don't know what it says about a movie when the best sequence 
features Steven Seagal.  That's right -- the same Seagal whose harsh 
monotone, unchanging expression, and wooden performances have earned him 
a worldwide following.  And, while Seagal doesn't have a major role in 
MY GIANT, his five minutes represent the film's undisputed highlight, 
because the humorless actor permits himself to be the object a 
particularly biting satire.  In fact, not only does Seagal allow his 
dubious thespian talents to be skewered, but he actively participates in 
the process.  After seeing MY GIANT, I'm willing to admit a certain 
degree of respect for the man.  (I will ignore the possibility that 
Seagal didn't realize this to be a parody -- nobody could possibly be 
that obtuse, could they?) </P>
<P>     Billy Crystal is a naturally funny performer.  Put him in front the 
Oscar crowd of 1 billion people, and he shines, with his ad-libs 
generating more laughs than the material flashing up on the 
TelePrompTer.  In fact, it's only because of Crystal's innate ability to 
make people smile that MY GIANT is remotely watchable.  The comic's 
self-deprecating humor, highlighted in a number of stinging one-liners, 
provides a partial antidote to the mawkish sentimentality that floods 
the film's second half.  Director Michael Lehmann appears to have been 
going for RAIN MAN meets JERRY MAGUIRE, but falls considerably short of 
the mark.  MY GIANT will give THE ODD COUPLE 2 (another major April 10 
release) a run for its money in the "pointless mediocrity" category.</P>
<P>     Speaking of Lehmann, few directors in Hollywood have had such an 
uneven career.  (Bruce Beresford is the only other one who immediately 
comes to mind.)  On the positive side, he has helmed such top-notch 
comedies as HEATHERS and THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS.  But he has also 
been responsible for duds like MEET THE APPLEGATES, HUDSON HAWK, and now 
MY GIANT.  About the only noteworthy thing Lehmann can claim for this 
film is that he had an opportunity to work with one of the tallest 
actors ever to grace the big screen.</P>
<P>     That actor is Gheorghe Muresan, a 7'7" man with an Eastern European 
accent so thick that he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger sound American-born.  
Muresan is described as "fluent" in English, but, while he may 
understand the words, he isn't always intelligible.  Half the time, I 
wasn't sure whether he was speaking in Romanian or English, and, when he 
delivers a speech from Shakespeare's "Henry V," it took me a moment to 
realize who he was quoting.  Muresan, who is plagued by limited range, 
isn't a great performer, but he's at least competent enough to develop a 
sympathetic character.  Then again, when it comes to casting giants, 
Lehmann probably didn't have much of a group to pick from.</P>
<P>     MY GIANT opens with mild-mannered Sam (Crystal) driving around 
Romania, looking for a town whose name he can't pronounce.  Sam is an 
agent (or, in his words, "a leech, a vulture, ...a scum-sucking pig"), 
and his lone client is on-location doing a BRAVEHEART-like epic.  When 
an unexpected flock of sheep forces Sam to drive his car off the road 
and into a water-filled ditch, he is saved from drowning by Max 
(Muresan), the biggest man he has ever seen ("Please don't say 'fe fi fo 
fum'").  Max, who lives at a local monastery doing odd-jobs for the 
monks, is actually a gentle soul whose time is spent pining after his 
lost love, a girl he once knew who moved to America.  Sam, sensing a 
chance to make Max into a big star, uses the lure of seeing her again as 
a carrot to persuade the giant to travel to the United States, where he 
can audition for a role in the new Steven Seagal action film, DOUBLE OR 
NOTHING.  However, as Sam spends more time with Max, he develops a 
genuine affection for his new client, and comes to re-discover the 
importance of family -- namely, his son, Nick (Zane Carney), and 
estranged wife, Serena (Kathleen Quinlan).  </P>
<P>     MY GIANT is surprisingly lean in the laugh department, especially 
once the buddy story kicks into high gear.  The scene in MY GIANT 
guaranteed to generate the loudest guffaws happens early in the film, 
and features projectile vomiting.  Yeah, it's gross, but so was the 
overeating bit in MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE, and that had me 
laughing so hard that tears were running down my cheeks.  This isn't 
nearly as funny, but for those who aren't turned off this sort of stuff, 
there's a payoff.  </P>
<P>     At its heart, MY GIANT tries to be a feel-good tale, but it's too 
pat and cloying to be effective.  Like JERRY MAGUIRE, it's about a jaded 
man learning to place friendship and love above being shown the money.  
>From the start, MY GIANT feels plotted and manipulative, with a story 
that seems pieced together using scraps of other, better movies.  
There's also too much going on -- Lehmann should have chosen to 
concentrate on one particular plot element (the relationship between Sam 
and Max, for example) rather than throwing them together with an ample 
dose of saccharine and setting the cinematic blender to "puree."  The 
result is predictably mixed up and dissatisfying.</P>
