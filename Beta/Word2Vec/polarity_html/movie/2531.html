                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>BAD GIRLS (or, "Girls Just Want to Have Guns")
Starring:  Madeleine Stowe, Mary Stuart Masterson, Andie MacDowell,
Drew Barrymore, James Russo, Dermot Mulroney.
Screenplay:  Ken Friedman and Yolande Finch.
Director:  Jonathan Kaplan.</P>
<P>     I'd be willing to bet that someone sold the concept for BAD GIRLS
with a one-line pitch like, "THE WILD BUNCH in bloomers." Such is the
way in Hollywood these days.  After all, Westerns have been hot at the
box office, and making the protagonists women guarantees a smidgen of
politically correct credibility (in addition to cleavage).  Besides,
with the paucity of good roles for women, talented actresses like
Madeleine Stowe and Mary Stuart Masterson will jump at that chance to
shoot guns.  The problem is that these prefabricated films almost never
bring along a script.  BAD GIRLS is always either hopelessly cliche or
insufferably stupid--and usually both.</P>
<P>     BAD GIRLS is the story of four prostitutes in Echo City, Colorado,
who wind up on the run together when one of them, Cody Zamora (Stowe)
kills an unruly customer.  She is saved from the hangman's noose by
Anita (Masterson), Eileen (Andie MacDowell) and Lily (Drew Barrymore),
and they head out together with detectives hot on their trail.  Their
plan is to make their way to Oregon, where Anita and her late husband
had a timber claim, and to finance a lumber operation with Cody's ample
savings.  These plans are interrupted when those savings are stolen by
Kid Jarrett (James Russo), a notorious bandit who has a history with
Cody.  The women and the gang of thieves repeatedly cross paths until
it becomes clear that this movie ain't big enough for the both of 'em.</P>
<P>     BAD GIRLS is frequently so incoherent that I was forced to wonder
whether director had chopped all the raw footage into two minute
chunks, strewn them about on the editing room floor and pieced the film
together in whatever order he happened to pick them up.  I knew I was
in trouble from the outset, when the rescue of Cody takes place.
Screenwriters Ken Friedman and Yolande Finch couldn't be bothered with
such niceties as explaining why Eileen and Lily might want to save Cody
(at least Anita was the one Cody saved).  There is not a second spent
letting these characters interact first, so that there seems to be some
kind of connection between them.  Apparently it's enough that they're
sisters in the world's oldest profession.  Then we are introduced to
Josh (Dermot Mulroney), a taciturn cowboy who's out to avenge ... wild
guess, anyone? ... the death of his Pa.  The thing is that this subplot
is not only cliche, it's put together in the least economical way
possible, with the inclusion of Kid Jarrett's aging father (Robert
Loggia).  This additional character just muddles the movie further; in
fact, I would go so far as to say that the inclusion of the entire Josh
subplot is unnecessary.  But that would have left Cody without a love
interest, and we couldn't have that, now could we?</P>
<P>     Oh, but there's more, pardners.  In the last two minutes, there is
the suggestion that Lily harbors a more intimate affection for Eileen,
something we are completely unaware of until the music swells to a
tear-jerking crescendo which means nothing because we have been given
no background.  James LeGros makes an appearance as a simple
homesteader who wins Eileen's heart, but his is the only performance
that isn't completely perfunctory.  Madeleine Stowe and Mary Stuart
Masterson are two of my favorite current young actresses, and both are
forced to spout dialogue which puts the "hack" back in hackneyed.
Director Jonathan Kaplan apparently had no idea what to do with a
Western, so rather than set up his own shots he tries to do his
half-hearted homage to Sam Peckinpah, with disastrous results.  Whole
set pieces are ripped off from THE WILD BUNCH, and Kaplan's use of slow
motion becomes absurdly comic.  The cinematography is quite good, but a
big pile of garbage is a big pile of garbage no matter what kind of
filter you put over the lens.</P>
<P>     Sometimes you can look at a film as bad as BAD GIRLS and see the
germ of an interesting idea that was undeveloped or simply butchered,
but not here.  There isn't the faintest attempt to make BAD GIRLS a
real examination of the plight of women in the American West; the women
are just a gimmick, unlike in THE BALLAD OF LITTLE JO.  BAD GIRLS is
lazy, stupid, sloppy and, worst of all, boring.</P>
<PRE>     They are women, hear me snore.</PRE>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 cowgrrrls:  1.</PRE>
