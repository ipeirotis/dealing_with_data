<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Benoît Jacquot (A Single Girl) has created a disconcerting tale about
the sufferings of a stunning 17-year-old Parisian girl, Beth (Godrèche),
who due to harsh family circumstances must learn how to grow up fast
without losing her childhood innocence. Her one asset in life, is her
ability to attract men. How she handles the few dramatic moments of her
life, right before her high school graduation, is what makes this a very
French film.</P>
<P>"The Disenchanted" opens with Beth just finishing a round of lovemaking
with her repugnant boyfriend (Bozonnet) and with him watching her as she
is sound asleep. He is someone she never calls by name, but as a running
gag throughout the film, he is called Whatsisname. He needles her into
telling him the dream she just had, as she reluctantly tells him it is
about a young woman who blindly chooses her Prince Charming, whom she
does not look at while he is penetrating her, and when she sees him, she
is shocked to see that he is an old geezer. The cocky boyfriend takes
this dream personally as an insult and suggests she find someone really
ugly to make love with, as a test for her love to him.</P>
<P>Angered by this childish challenge, she goes to a disco and meets
Eduoard (Mage), who is also 17. He's a computer-geek who evidently meets
her criteria for ugliness. But, I guess beauty is in the eye of the
beholder, because he didn't look like a train wreck to me. When she
lures him back to his wealthy home and decides to go through with her
plan, it fails to materialize when he awkwardly fondles her and she
rushes out of his house.</P>
<P>Back with her family, she relates to her sexually inquisitive eight year
old brother Remi (Salsman), by a mixture of teasing him and coddling
him, trying to feel not so lonely by having him around as a companion.
Her mother (Thérèse Liotard) remains bed-ridden, telling her daughter
that she depends on money given to her by Beth's uncle, a wealthy
doctor, whom they call Sugardaddy (Ivan). Beth shows her disdain for the
old rascal and his money by remaining mute in his presence. But her
mother orders her to go to his house to pick up the check he gives them
to meet their expenses, knowing full well what he wants from her. The
mother disingenuously tells her, "I've done worst things to help you."</P>
<P>In school, she chooses to do her final report on the disenchanted poet
Rimbaud, who has struck a chord with her because he was always leaving
places to become an adventurer, gunrunner, and searcher for gold, while
always remaining true to himself as a poet. He finally says that he must
stop leaving places and make a stand where he is. Her class report,
though well-received, is still challenged by her teacher who tells her
how the ones giving the final exam are not sympathetic with so much of
the passion in her argument.</P>
<P>She seems to be in a no-win situation whatever she does, and to get a
little childish revenge, because after all, she is still a child, she
has her artist-student friend Chang (Hai Truhong) silk-screen an image
of her boyfriend on his front door and she further scribbles on the door
that he's a bastard. The boyfriend is furious that she won't see him
anymore and gives her an ultimatum to meet him in the park or else. When
she meets him there, he starts beating her and a middle-aged man named
Alphonse (Bozonnet) comes along and pulls a knife on him, sparing her
from any further harm.</P>
<P>Alphonse turns out to be a writer, suffering himself from the loss of a
girlfriend and can't reach out any further to her than to see her as a
poor-replacement.</P>
<P>The suffering comes to an end as Beth realizes that she has no choice
but to leave home and strike out on her own. The feeling is that this
three day adventure has strengthened her for all else that will befall
her in life. But the optimism, what little there is, seems to be, that
she had the nerve to go out into the unknown alone and go after what she
wanted to do with her life.</P>
<P>The beauty in the film is in Judith Godrèche portrayal, that gets the
most out of the terse dialogue and slim story, as she manages to look
alluring in many different poses and who through her vitality and
cynicism, always gives off a sense of hope that she will survive, no
matter the situation. She fits the lifestyle of the existential hero...a
female version of a Camus hero or a Rimbaud protagonist. The film had a
very lively pulse which added to its intelligent drama. The heroine is
seen as being both the object of someone else's desire and someone with
powerful desires of her own.</P>
