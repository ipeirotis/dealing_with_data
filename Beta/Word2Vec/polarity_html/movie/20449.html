<PRE>VERTIGO
Fragments Of An Obsession</PRE>
<P>In the pantheon of film making, there are undoubtable classics that stand
out as monumental artifacts of this art form. Some of these remain the
standards where new films are measured against and even imitated upon.
Citizen Kane, Casablanca and Lawrence of Arabia are such examples of a great
tradition of movie making that have been widely praised, liked and even
analyzed upon in countless books and articles. Yet, legendary as these films
are, there is one motion picture that has reached the heights of such
similar classic status, but still remains as one of the least conspicuous
among its more illustrious peers. I am referring to Alfred Hitchcock's
Vertigo.</P>
<P>Released to muted reviews and disappointing box office receipts, Vertigo has
since gained much respect and admiration from all aspects of the film
community. Ranging from film historians to the casual fan, Vertigo has now
deservedly taken its place among Hitchcock's other classic films as one of
the most intriguing of all thriller movies. And certainly, one of the most
personal films ever to have emerged from arguably, the best director in this
business. Beginning with this movie, Hitchcock managed to create a trilogy
of films in successive years that is perhaps, the most remarkable ever
attempted by any director. North By Northwest, Psycho and Vertigo feature
frequently among critics' best of lists and represents the culmination of
Hitchcock's prowess, as well as showcasing his brilliant skills as a
film-maker and his extensive knowledge of the language of the cinema.</P>
<P>Part of the mystique of the movie stems from the fact that it is misleading
the viewer right from the beginning, the plot seemingly about how James
Stewart's character, Scottie Ferguson tries to prevent "Madeline", played by
Kim Novak, from succumbing to a supernatural force that threatens to possess
and ultimately, overwhelms her. This deception is carried on brilliantly by
both the performances and the usually taut direction that Hitchcock imposes
on the entire picture. It is not until the middle third of the movie, that
Hitchcock surprisingly reveals the mystery in a fashion that completely
catches the viewer off guard. From there on, the film shifts to a more
personal tone of undesirable and questionable obsession on Scottie's part to
transform Judy back into his dream woman that was "Madeline". Yet, the
"Madeline" that he seeks never existed at all. It is this irony that
provides this film with its unique, almost surrealistic tone and among
Hitchcock's works, this is the film that is at once darkly depressing as it
is revealingly autobiographical.</P>
<P>Jimmy Stewart has always been known to play the charming and effervescent
American ordinary everyday guy, a role that is similarly typified by Tom
Hanks today. His winsome smile garnered him with his only Academy award in
The Philadelphia Story and his even more famous turn as George Bailey in
Capra's It's A Wonderful Life cemented Stewart as the quintessential
American hero. A face and a style that any American and even non-American
can identify with. But since he began to work with Hitchcock, Jimmy Stewart
began a series of roles that played him against type and character.</P>
<P>In Rear Window, Stewart's L.B. Jefferies's character begins the film as a
restless voyeuristic photographer. But by the end of the movie, one tends to
forget this questionable aspect of his character as he manages to solve a
murder mystery in the process. In Vertigo, however, Stewart plays a
character that displays even more flaws then the Jefferies character could
ever have. At the beginning, he faces seemingly increasing difficulty in
overcoming his fear of heights that was triggered off by his guilt towards
causing the death of a fellow police officer. Hitchcock then pulls off an
incredible delusion to the audience by deliberately misleading us into
thinking that Scottie Ferguson will conquer his fear by falling in love and
by resolving the mystery that surrounds "Madeline".</P>
<P>For all his reputation for suspense and thriller films, Hitchcock's ultimate
masterpiece does not focus on those two aspects as he does on the personal
aspects of his two main characters in the picture. We are allowed a glimpse
into the director's mindset and dare I say it, his emotions as he molded
Scottie and "Madeline" into human beings that seem at once, frightfully true
to life and yet, almost dreamlike in pure visual terms. As the audience, we
can certainly identify with Scottie's pursuit of his perfect woman as at one
time or another, each one of us had probably wanted to find that same person
who can fulfill our ultimate fantasies. The difference is, Scottie manages
to come close.</P>
<P>Only close, because his fantasy woman is after all, a masquerade fabricated
by his longtime friend Gavin Elster to deliberately lead Scottie into his
murderous scheme as an unknowing accomplice and also, as a convenient
scapegoat and alibi. Judy, the woman who plays the role of "Madeline" is
nothing like the "Madeline" that Scottie envisions. The real Judy is a more
earthly woman that seems at once materialistic and bubbly, which contrasts
strikingly with the icy cold blonde that is "Madeline", who simply emanates
with stylish sophistication. But Scottie is never let into this revelation
as early as the audience, so from the moment the truth is made known to the
viewer, we are made to observe and follow his emotional trauma in losing
"Madeline" and then the joy of rediscovering her in the form of Judy.</P>
<P>The beauty of the picture lies not in watching it for the first time, but
from subsequent viewings, when the audience has the intimate knowledge of
what has happened. The first half of the movie then takes on multiple layers
of meanings and and it becomes a responsibility for the viewer to understand
how difficult it is for Kim Novak to play Judy who herself is playing
"Madeline". Her movements and gestures are even more impressive with the
realization that she herself is putting up an act of deception and deceit.
Yet, from the moment Scottie fishes her out of the waters of the Golden Gate
bridge, the audience can almost identify with the extreme restraint that is
evident in Judy's eyes and that keeps her from revealing herself to Scottie.</P>
<P>Later in Scottie's apartment, we are already well aware of the ruse that
Judy is putting up for him. It is convincing to the point that the first
time viewer is totally taken in by the deception. You could believe that she
was suffering from amnesia, seemingly possessed by a "supernatural spirit"
that guides her through the various locations of San Francisco. But seeing
it the second time, notice how Novak manages to "act" surprised and shocked
in waking up naked in Scottie's room. But for all intents and purposes, she
"lets" him bring her there and even "lets" him undresses her in a deliberate
attempt to delude him. Throughout the whole charade, Scottie is completely
oblivious to the fact that she "knows". It is this idea of irony and
deceptive role-play that gives this film an unusual aural of mystery and
surrealistic romantiscm.</P>
<P>This is a romance that is unlikely, yet when it does finally occur, at the
cliffs where Judy almost overacts her part, we are already under the
impression that Scottie is in love with her. Simultaneously, we are equally
convinced that Judy, masquerading as "Madeline" is also falling for him. The
Hitchcockian touch at resolving this romance is sheer genius as it breaks
new ground in the way it treat film lovers on screen. Electing not to
provide an avenue for the doomed lovers to escape from, he decides to end
the picture almost abruptly at the infamous bell tower scene. It is the same
exact spot where earlier on, Scottie first witnesses the "suicidal" fall of
Elster's real wife. The same exact scene where Scottie relives his guilt at
being unable to prevent a certain death due to his vertigo.</P>
<P>A guilt which is unfairly burdened upon him the second time round as he is
only playing a pawn in the midst of a greater murderous scheme. A scheme
that involves Judy as "Madeline", a common girl hired by Elster because her
looks probably resemble that of Elster's wife. A guilt which would be
further complicated by the realization that Judy would herself find herself
falling hopelessly for him. At the end of the picture, Hitchcock has to
submit Scottie to one last trauma at the bell tower. Right at the moment
when Scottie is faced with the most difficult decision of his life, of
whether or not to bring Judy to justice or simply carry on the deception and
let the past slip by. The appearance of the nun at the top of the bell tower
is an inspired decision, a decision apparently made by Samuel Taylor, the
main scriptwriter for the film.</P>
<P>A nun represents God, and if the ending is abrupt, the resolvement of Judy's
involvement in the murder of the actual "Madeline" is to symbolize the
cliched notion that criminals may escape the hands of the law, but not from
the hand of God. Her apparent accidental fall may be even more symbolic in
the sense that she is re-enacting what she was asked to do by Elster, to
pretend to fall to her death to mask the death and murder of his actual
wife. The terrific irony here again is she is not acting, but really "doing"
it this time. Falling to her own death, which is as real as Elster's wife
death was. With that, the film concludes with the everlasting image of
Stewart's Scottie standing at the bell tower, looking down on the lifeless
body of his de-mystified obsession, a woman who never existed for him. A
woman who was manufactured for the purpose of a diabolical crime, and a
woman was in turn, re-manufactured by the very same man she was supposed to
deceive.</P>
<P>The re-fashioning of Judy into "Madeline" is itself, worthy of much
discussion. The main focal point becomes that of Judy being willing to
subject herself to a second of time of role-playing. But whereas the first
was due to financial and material benefits, possibly from Elster himself,
the second was unquestionably due to the purpose of pleasing Scottie. For by
the time she was "rediscovered", the audience can sense her love for him.
This is most clearly demonstrated in her reluctance to leave him a goodbye
note explaining the whole crime, and willing to play a second round of
charade with Scottie. And even after voicing her objections to being
remodeled, she eventually subjects herself to Scottie's almost unhealthy
desire to see and possess "Madeline" back in the form of another woman who
"happens" to look like her. This possession obsession at one time becomes
almost surreal. Look at the scene when she finally emerges from the bathroom
as the completed "product".</P>
<P>Roger Ebert calls this the single best shot or sequence that Hitchcock has
ever done, and I am very inclined to agree. The ghostlike green glow serves
as a haunting, almost hallucinating background to Novak's "Madeline" as she
proceeds with almost torturous pace towards Scottie. Their eyes locked in
almost twin emotions of elation and pain. Elation because both have
ultimately satisfied each other's desires. She, because she believes he will
finally accept her, and he, because the woman he thought he had "lost" so
dramatically and tragically has finally returned. In a scene where there is
no background or ambient noise, just images and Bernard Herrmann's stirring
and hauntingly romantic score, it is the ultimate piece of pure cinema
anyone has since or will ever conjure up. The moment the two tragic lovers
lock and embrace, the camera circles around the both of them, and as it does
so, images of San Juan Batista emerge from behind them, as if to indicate
that the past has caught up with the present, and later will engulf them to
a powerfully emotional and tragic end. Yet, Scottie clings on to her as if
he never has lost her, and he is at once willing to believe that she is the
same "Madeline" that he has fallen for during the first part of the film. He
hesitates only for a brief moment, but once he is convinced that she is
"genuine", he embraces her with the utmost of passion that has yet been
captured on celluloid.</P>
<P>Perhaps, the optimist would have hoped the film should have ended there. But
then, there is always the moral issue of not letting characters getting away
with blatant crime, especially when it involves murder. For us, for
Hitchcock, the resolution of this film represents one of the best climatic
endings to a motion picture. Dark, emotional, tense and frightful, these are
the emotions that one goes through together with the two leads as they
ascend the steps of the bell tower. Of course, the innovative "Vertigo" shot
heightens the tension and gives us a visual simulation of what Scottie is
feeling as he looks down towards the depths of the stairs. As Scottie
unravels the truth, a truth where Novak's character and the audience are
already well aware of, we see his expression of anger and of passion at the
same time. Emotions which would have been overplayed by any other actor,
Jimmy Stewart manages to convince us equally of his confusion, his guilt,
his hurt and his ultimate love for a fabled "woman" from which there is no
turning back from. As he reaches the top, he is ultimately faced with his
own strong belief of upholding the law, and his equally passionate feelings
for a woman who has deceived him and yet, now offer the only real hope of
redemption and his only compromised opportunity for a perfect love. And as
he contemplates his decision for either justice or love, he is cruelly
robbed of that decision as Judy accidentally plunges towards her own demise,
a justice meted out by perhaps, in equally "supernatural" manner.</P>
<P>As a motion picture, Vertigo possesses all the necessary technical
credentials for a 1958 film. George Tomasini's taut editing, Robert Burks's
elegant cinematography, Saul Bass's innovative and hypnotic title designs
and of course, Herrmann's score. The importance of how music affects a film
has never been understated. Yet somehow, Herrmann's musical soundtrack
manages to bring images that Burk's camera could not even capture. The
haunting title theme elicits both terror and romance simultaneously, and it
is this musical picture that gives the audience a glance into the movie's
contents right at the beginning of the credits. Coupled this with the eerie
logos supplied creatively by Bass and extreme close-ups of the woman's lips
and eye, Vertigo manages to evoke the entire atmosphere of the film in the
first few minutes. Herrmann's score is never catchy or tuneful, just long
stretches of mesmerizing moods and ambience that complements both story and
performances to perfection. At times overbearing, at times tender, this is
music that lives up to the high expectations of the director and his actors.
Pure cinema such as this could not have been created without the musical
strains of Bernard Herrmann and the striking photography of Burk and
Hitchcock.</P>
<P>Artistically, films like Citizen Kane and A Birth Of A Nation may have
displayed much more cinematic invention in terms of camera techniques and
other technical innovations. Vertigo however, propels the film medium
further by taking the established cinematic approaches and transcends them
by exploring the human emotion on celluloid. To accomplish this requires a
director of immense knowledge and skill, and a touch of brilliance. Further,
a set of actors who are able to translate the written script into film and
then expand on it by giving their own unique touch of humanity and
expression. Alfred Hitchcock, James Stewart and Kim Novak together with
Samuel Taylor and the crew of Vertigo created a cinematic milestone in 1958
and like the aforementioned film classics, it ranks as a motion picture
masterpiece worthy of the highest accolades. In generations to come, Vertigo
will only serve as a reminder to the art of the motion picture . or in
Hitchcock's preference, the art of pure cinema.</P>
