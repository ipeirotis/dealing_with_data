THE INHERITORS
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1998 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  * 1/2</PRE>
<P>What's left for peasants to do when the owner of the farm they worked
all their lives has died?  Quite a lot actually, in writer and director
Stefan Ruzowitzky's morality tale, THE INHERITORS (DIE SIEBTELBAUERN),
set in a 1930's Austria that looks like the 1730s.  They've inherited
the farm, and they've never worked so hard in their lives now that they
are both employers and employees.</P>
<P>Their owner has died of mysterious circumstances, angering the local
police, who like their murderers to be caught red-handed.  The story
isn't a murder mystery per se, the crime's investigation being shuttled
off to a cinematic sidetrack.</P>
<P>The setup concerns the effect of the owner's will.  Hating basically
everyone in the town, he gives his farm to the peasants who have worked
it.  Not some noble gesture, his bequest is done as a kind of a lark,
and he says in the will that he expects them to fight among themselves.
Among the ten peasants, the two leaders are played by Sophie Rois as
Emmy and Simon Schwarz as Lukas.</P>
<P>The formula film rigidly dichotomizes the local inhabitants into the
good and the bad.  The good are the free-spirited, lithe peasants
dressed in cheerful, plaid clothes.  The bad can be just as easily
recognized.  They are the farmers with their abundant girth and black,
somber suits, hats and ties.  The farmers get lines certain to draw our
wrath.  ("God wants things the way they are, and the way they have
always been," the lead farmer argues as to why it isn't right for
peasants to own their own farm.)</P>
<P>The characters lack much depth or complexity.  Looking at their clothes
is sufficient information to predict their behavior.  Made in
interchangeable parts, the peasants are downtrodden and hence worthy of
our sympathy.  The farmers, rich and vicious, are deserving of our
indignation.  It is all rather like vaudeville plays in which they hold
up "applause" and "hiss" signs to instruct the audience on how they are
supposed to feel when the various characters are on stage.</P>
<P>As a director, Stefan Ruzowitzky strives to set a whimsical tone, but
his script doesn't provide much humorous material to back up his
intentions.  Sometimes, as in the gang rape sequence, he tries hard to
manipulate our emotions.  The problem with this and other similar scenes
is that the characters are not genuine enough for us to care as we
should.</P>
<P>The body of the movie has the farmers conniving to get the farm from the
peasants while the peasants work hard to save it.  Lacking much
complexity, the movie exists on scenes like the recurring one around the
large kitchen table.  The peasants scarf down their soup while grimacing
at each other.  They always keep a place set for the dead owner.  Why is
never adequately explained, since they loathed him.</P>
<P>Ultimately it isn't what happens in THE INHERITORS that is the problem,
but what doesn't.  The story is so thin that it is barely there, and the
formula film runs most of the time on autopilot.</P>
<P>THE INHERITORS runs 1:32.  It is in German with English subtitles.  The
film isn't rated but would be an R for sex, nudity, violence, profanity
and rape and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are older
and mature.</P>
