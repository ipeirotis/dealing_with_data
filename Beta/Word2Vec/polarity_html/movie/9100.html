<P>     When it comes to "food" movies, you know the titles:  BABETTE'S 
FEAST, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, BIG NIGHT, and so on...  You also know the 
advice:  eat before coming to the theater or suffer a grumbling stomach 
for ninety-plus minutes followed by a mad dash to the nearest restaurant 
once the end credits start to roll.  And, while SOUL FOOD, the first 
major release from director George Tillman Jr. (who previously made a 
low-budget feature called SCENES FOR THE SOUL), isn't on the same level 
as the previously-mentioned motion pictures, there's at least one scene 
that's a literal feast for the eyes.</P>
<P>     Whether it's BOYZ 'N THE HOOD, DEAD PRESIDENTS, or SET IT OFF, the 
tendency for movies aimed at black audiences is to make them fast-paced, 
loud, and violent.  As a result, a kinder, gentler movie like SOUL FOOD 
is something of a rarity (although, with entrees like THE PREACHER'S 
WIFE and LOVE JONES, they are becoming a little more common).  This film 
is a celebration of life and family, and a recognition that, through 
good times and bad times, the ties of blood provide an unbreakable life-
line.</P>
<P>     SOUL FOOD tells the story of the trials of the Joseph family when 
their beloved matriarch, Mama Joe (Irma P. Hall), slips into a diabetes-
induced coma.  Without Mama Joe's ritual Sunday dinners to keep everyone 
together, the family begins to drift apart, with gaps widening between 
sisters and spouses.  The film essentially follows the lives of Mama 
Joe's three daughters.  Terri (Vanessa L. Williams), the eldest, is a 
driven lawyer who puts work above her neglected husband, Miles (Michael 
Beach).  Miles is tempted away from his steady, well-paying job by the 
lure of his true love, music, and away from his wife by the proffered 
charms of Terri's cousin, Faith (Gina Ravera).  Maxine (Viveca Fox) is 
happily married to Kenny (Jeffrey D. Sams), and spends her days caring 
for her husband and three children.  Bird (Nia Long) is newly hitched to 
ex-con Lem (Mekhi Phifer), an intense, caring man whose volatile temper 
often proves to be his undoing.  </P>
<P>     SOUL FOOD is told from the point-of-view of young Ahmed (Brandon 
Hammond), Maxine and Kenny's son.  While a few of his observations are 
insightful, most of his voiceover narrative is superfluous and even 
irritating.  75% of what he says is either needless exposition or 
useless trivia.  Simply put, the kid won't shut up.  It's one thing to 
open and close a film with a voiceover, but Ahmed's voice can be heard 
throughout, dispensing pearls of wisdom that we could have easily done 
without.</P>
<P>     Because the main characters are female, it's easy to compare SOUL 
FOOD to the uneven WAITING TO EXHALE.  Both films feature their share of 
small melodramas, and neither has an especially high opinion of the male 
gender (although SOUL FOOD, which is written and directed by a man, 
doesn't come as close to "male-bashing" as EXHALE did).  But, despite a 
share of minor cliches and the occasional too-pat resolution, SOUL FOOD 
is easily the better film.  The acting is more believable, the storyline 
is more true-to-life, and the characters are more sympathetic.  SOUL 
FOOD stays a cut above the average melodrama by keeping the characters 
grounded and the situations from becoming too ripe.  There's a fine line 
between good, solid drama and the sudsiness of a soap opera, and, 
although there are times when SOUL FOOD crosses over, the movie remains 
predominantly on the right side.</P>
<P>     With a uniformly attractive cast, SOUL FOOD isn't hard on the eyes.  
Everyone (including Vanessa Williams, who isn't known as a stellar 
actress) acquits themselves admirably, although it's worth noting that 
none of the roles are terribly complex, so there's little need for 
anyone to stretch their range.  And, while the meals don't take on the 
same importance as in certain other food movies, we still get an eyeful:  
deep-fried catfish, chicken and dumplings, cornbread, cakes, and other 
assorted dishes.  SOUL FOOD contains enough diverse cinematic 
ingredients to add a little zest and flavor to the pleasant-but-familiar 
cinematic fare of an African American family drama.</P>
