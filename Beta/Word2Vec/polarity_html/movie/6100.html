<P>     By wedding comedy with tragedy in intricate, realistic unions, Mike 
Leigh has become one of the foremost film making voices for the British 
working class.  Yet, even though his movies bring a certain social 
viewpoint to the screen, this in no way limits the universality of 
Leigh's themes.  SECRETS AND LIES, 1996's Palme D'Or winner at Cannes, 
represents the director at his best -- unsentimental yet powerful, funny 
and poignant, and, in the end, undeniably satisfying.</P>
<P>     The film will resonate with anyone who has ever hidden a secret or 
told a lie (that should cover everyone).  This isn't overblown 
melodrama; rather, it's the kind of starkly believable tale that could 
happen to anyone.  Nothing in SECRETS AND LIES demands even a momentary 
suspension of disbelief.  In fact, the film works best for those who 
approach it as a reflection of life.  We can all relate to the issues 
being raised -- simple truths like adoption, infertility, and 
mother/daughter friction.  </P>
<P>     SECRETS AND LIES opens with a funeral, then quickly switches to a 
wedding.  During the former ceremony, Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), 
a 27-year old black optometrist, is burying her mother.  In the next 
scene, we meet Maurice (Timothy Spall), a 38-year old white photographer 
who's taking pictures of a nervous bride.  It takes nearly the entire 
movie before these two characters come face-to-face, but what happens 
during that meeting represents the climax of Leigh's beautifully-
realized film.  Hortense and Maurice are crucial to unraveling the 
entire sequence of secrets and lies.</P>
<P>     Hortense was adopted.  She has known this since she was seven years 
old, but it's not until both of her parents are dead that she feels 
compelled to seek out her birth mother.  Despite being warned by a 
social worker to anticipate unpleasantness or disappointment, Hortense 
is shocked to learn that her mother is white.  Her name is Cynthia 
(Brenda Blethyn), and she's a 42-year old neurotic living in a dark, 
gloomy rowhouse with her 21-year old daughter, Roxanne (Claire 
Rushbrook).  Cynthia is disliked by just about everyone who knows her, 
except perhaps her brother, Maurice.  Even Maurice's wife, Monica 
(Phyllis Logan), hates the idea of spending a day in Cynthia's company.</P>
<P>     SECRETS AND LIES chronicles Hortense's initial approach to Cynthia, 
their first meeting, and the development of a tentative bond.  Each 
offers something unique to the other:  Cynthia has lost her "real" 
daughter's love and respect, and is desperate to find a surrogate -- who 
better than the grown-up child she once gave away?  Hortense, on the 
other hand, feels rootless now that the two people who brought her up 
are dead, and, while she doesn't look to Cynthia for parenting, she is 
curious about, and, ultimately, sympathetic with the disappointments 
that have defined her biological mother's life.  There are no 
recriminations, at least not on Hortense's part.  Any guilt that Cynthia 
feels is entirely of her own creation.</P>
<P>     Leigh develops the story slowly, introducing us to each character, 
and, through actions and dialogue, allowing us to learn about their 
lives.  We are not force-fed facts and details.  There are no flashbacks 
nor is there a voiceover narration.  The film's almost-documentary 
quality is belied only by the care and thought put into each camera 
shot.  From beginning to end, SECRETS AND LIES is exceptionally well 
thought-out.  </P>
<P>     Emotional impact is crucial to the movie's success.  Leigh employs 
a number of single-camera, unedited shots to facilitate dramatic 
development by letting the depth of emotions play out on screen.  (How 
many movies cut away when things get too heavy?)  One such sequence is 
the first meeting between Hortense and Cynthia.  It's an incredible 
scene, with these two sitting side-by-side in a restaurant booth, trying 
to reconcile the past with the present, and groping for words to express 
what they're feeling.  This is all accomplished in one shot, with no 
cuts or edits.  A similar approach is used for their third meeting, and 
during a cookout near the end.</P>
<P>     Brenda Blethyn won the Cannes Best Actress award for her daring, 
emotionally naked portrayal of Cynthia, and, while she's excellent, it's 
hard to single out any individual in this ensemble cast.  These actors 
aren't just good, they're superlative.  Leigh has a history of getting 
the most out of his performers (look at David Thewlis in NAKED), and, if 
SECRETS AND LIES is anything to judge by, it's a well-deserved 
reputation.  This is the kind of film that is made or broken by actors, 
and there's not a false note to be found in any of the performances.  </P>
<P>     With SECRETS AND LIES, Leigh has surpassed his considerable 
achievements in LIFE IS SWEET and NAKED.  This film exhibits the kind of 
breathtaking power that can be unearthed in a simple story.  There's no 
sensationalism -- Leigh has ignored stereotypes in carefully developing 
the situation (wealthy black professional; underprivileged, uneducated 
whites) to dispel racial tension.  This allows the dysfunctional family 
dynamics to be the sole focus.  Maurice sums up Leigh's most pressing 
theme when he laments, "Secrets and lies...We're all in pain!  Why can't 
we share our pain?"  What the director has accomplished with this 
picture is to fashion an amazingly-textured story that grips us with 
unexpected force on the first viewing, and is sure to reveal a new 
aspect each time we come back.  Without a doubt, SECRETS AND LIES is 
worth more than one trip to the theater.</P>
