<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>I didn't hate The Big Hit, even though it is a stupefyingly terrible
film.  For the entirety of its running time, my eyes were attached to
the screen, and I never once got bored.  I found the film interesting
because of its unique awfulness:  this is such a confused disaster of a
film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's
entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti
bowl.  </P>
<P>As a narrative, The Big Hit is pure garbage, never truly deciding its
genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries.  It reminded me a
lot of Grosse Pointe Blank, which is a similar film that fails in a lot
of the same ways.  It's fine to mix genres, if the film makers know what
they're doing.  Unfortunately, writer Ben Ramsey and director Kirk Wong
don't seem to know how to handle the material, and the result is an
action film that wants to be a comedy.  The biggest problem with the
amalgamation, in this case, is that the film is absurd and the comedy is
out of place.  But it sure is a fascinating failure.</P>
<P>Marky . . . er, Mark Wahlberg stars as Melvin Surley, a hitman.  He's a
good hitman, apparently, although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious
(he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and
shoots everything).  He works with a few other hitmen--Cisco (Lou
Diamond Phillips), Crunch (Bokeem Woodbine), and Vinnie (Antonio
Sabbato, Jr.).  They're a nice bunch of muscular guys, who stand around
in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex.  </P>
<P>They all work for a man named Paris (Avery Brooks), who is rich,
powerful, and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen.  It is very
important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own;
this, of course, is where the plot comes in.  They decide to kidnap a
young Japanese girl named Keiko (China Chow), who has a rich father. 
When they do this, it turns out she is Paris' . . . Goddaughter!  It's
very bad to have Paris against you.</P>
<P>The story is standard action film stuff.  It's nothing new, and nothing
particularly offensive (but certainly not the slightest bit
compelling).  Clearly the major selling point of The Big Hit is that
it's a John Woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip
comedy.  It's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent
films that go for the same idea (such as Face/Off and The Replacement
Killers, which are both far superior).  There are stunts that are fun to
watch:  the opening sequence has Melvin and two of his partners going in
to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story.  They use night
vision goggles and really powerful handguns.  Melvin is also very good
at breakdancing, and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives.</P>
<P>Like I said, it's not boring; most disasters aren't.  What makes it so
bad is its genre-shifting madness.  It seems to start out as a
quirky-but-realistic action comedy, as Melvin is seen transporting bags
of human remains.  Then, as soon as they go to their first hit, it turns
into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere.  Then,
somewhere in between, it turns back into comedy.  Keiko turns out to be
a spunky little girl; in one amusing scene, she is forced to read a
letter out loud, indicating that she has been kidnapped, but the letter
is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words. </P>
<P>And scenes like this work alone, but Wong applies this goofy tone to
scenes that should be more serious, or not be in the film at all.  One
of the most irritating moments has Paris ordering Cisco to come up to
his office after he learns that Keiko has been kidnapped; when Cisco
gets there, Paris and his men are standing around as if they knew Cisco
did it, but they let him out of there, telling him to find the
perpetrator.  The scene is played for laughs, but it isn't funny.  </P>
<P>And since it doesn't quite work as a comedy, it tries to fall back on
the action, which also fails.  This is a film where people fly fifteen
feet backwards when shot with a handgun.  Cars land on tree branches and
are supported by them.  Characters betray each other without a second
thought.  Grenades are thrown in tight places.  People jump out of tall
buildings and survive.  People outrun tumbling cars, and get out of the
way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds.  Most frustrating
of all, though, is the film's definition of a hit man:  these guys are
anything but subtle, quiet, and skilled individuals.  They're more like
socially depraved militia men (Melvin has an extensive collection of
firearms in his garage, including missile launchers and hand-held
machineguns).</P>
<P>The characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the
rest; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to
watch.  The acting is kind of fun, though--Wahlberg is a good actor, and
his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way. 
Phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character, while Christina
Applegate, who plays Melvin's fiancée, is convincingly air-headed.  </P>
<P>The Big Hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying
to be funny.  The funniest parts are supplied by the actors, and not by
the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners.  It's a true
disaster, one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone
is completely unintentional.  Despite all this, though, I must reiterate
the entertainment value here.  You can cherish the awfulness of a film
like this.  If you embrace The Big Hit for the catastrophe that it is,
you just might enjoy yourself.  </P>
