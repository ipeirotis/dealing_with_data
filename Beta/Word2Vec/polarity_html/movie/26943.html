<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>"Bounce" had some...well, bounce, to its moralistic romantic tale, as it
sets up a formulaic dilemma for a couple who fall in love and have to
face their own private demons. Don Roos ("The Opposite of Sex"), the
director-screenwriter, has come up with a smart script and lets his
adult stars act like real adults do and is not ashamed of the glossy
film becoming a tearjerker, and when the romance story tugs shamelessly
at my heart it feels good because there is a heartfelt rhythm in this
film that allowed me to clearly see what the troubled couple is feeling
without it seeming to be contrived, even though it is contrived. In
fact, the film is thoroughly engrossing and well-crafted until the
closing scenes, where some speeches are made to clear the air, which
seemed totally unnecessary. What helped carry the film through such
contrived spots, was the real-life romantic couple who star in the film,
Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow, playing two hurt souls who don't expect
to fall in love but do. Ben being a smug, womanizing ad executive and
Gwyneth, a young widow not knowing how to bounce back from the loss of
her husband in a plane crash. They had great chemistry onscreen, and
Paltrow in particular, seemed to make the story appealing and credible.
In the Hollywood tradition of such love stories, it seemed easy for the
audience to root for them to get together and make the romance work. The
only thing is, that the film is a little tougher than how most
mainstream films do romances but is not edgy enough to be an art film,
so it falls into the category of being not one or the other type of
film, which might cause it to be ignored by both audiences.</P>
<P>Waiting out a snowstorm at a bar at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, Buddy
Amaral (Affleck)
casually converses with writer Greg Janello (Tony Goldwyn) and a pretty
blonde businesswoman Mimi (Natasha Henstridge), and shoots a video of
the three of them horsing around. Greg voluntarily bumped himself from
an L.A.-bound flight in order to get two free round-trip tickets to
anywhere in the U.S. plus $200 and feels guilty about being so cheap and
letting down his family by not going home at once. Mimi has been given a
free hotel room because her flight was canceled, and when Buddy sees her
flashing the room coupon as a come on, he quickly decides to give his
Los Angeles ticket to Greg and spend the night with Mimi instead. Greg
takes the ticket because he is anxious to get back to his wife and two
young sons and do some pre-Christmas things with them, though feeling
nervous about taking the ticket, he is, at least, relieved of his guilty
feelings he was plagued by.</P>
<P>The plane crashes in Kansas, and the story goes into much detail of the
passenger mix-up, of the airline first saying he is not aboard and then
reversing themselves. Greg's wife Abby (Paltrow), not knowing if he was
on the flight, becomes devastated when she finds out that he was killed
in the crash.</P>
<P>The crash has a great affect on Buddy also, as he goes through a
personality transformation from being a slick playboy-type, to someone
who becomes overloaded with guilt and sensitivity, which makes his
alcohol problem more severe and he freaks out when drunk during an award
ceremony that his ad company wins for doing this bathetic commercial for
the airline to express bereavement to the families for the loved ones
they lost.</P>
<P>A year passes, as he goes through an alcohol rehab program and returns
to work, but gets transferred to a different Southern California
location, which happens to be where Greg's wife lives. He still feels
guilty for not dying and has a need to meet Abby to see if she's OK and
make amends to her as part of his A.A. 12 step program, but does not
have enough nerve to tell her that he was the one who switched tickets
with her hubby. She's going through her own guilt-trip and also lies to
him by telling him she's divorced. When he feels sorry for her, seeing
how she's a neophyte in the real estate business, he arranges to throw
her a big bone, as he connives his boss (Morton) into letting her sell
him the more spacious building his company needs to move its operations
to, thereby she unexpectedly gets a tremendous commission.</P>
<P>They both seem tentative about the attraction they have for each other,
afraid of entering a relationship, but he is willing to forget about
her, glad that he made amends by helping her out materially. But she
suddenly shows up at his workplace with two tickets to see a Dodgers
game, with the excuse that she wants to thank him for what he did. She
also comes clean and admits she lied about being divorced, but he still
needs more time to get his secret off his chest. They finally close
their romantic deal and sleep together, and he then shows he's a good
guy and a changed person by bonding with the kids. Sex is not presented
as the prize here, as much as a serious and meaningful relationship is.
It has probably been ages since that theme was tried as seriously as it
was in this mainstream film, and that just might be the most refreshing
thing about the film.</P>
<P>But he waits too long to tell her that he's the one who gave her husband
the ticket on the ill-fated flight, as she finds out in a surprising way
about it and can't forgive him. Her decision to break the relationship
causes anguish to both of them, as they try to find out what it is they
want and how they really feel. Since Paltrow is the better actor, she
mops up the screen in these scenes of anguish and is convincing as
someone who has been damaged and is afraid of getting hurt again.
Affleck is good as an actor conveying someone who is arrogant and
shallow and full of false bravado, but is not convincing as someone who
has been down for the count and is bouncing back as a changed man. His
sudden change to the sensitive-type seemed artificial, leaving questions
about what he was doing in the first place in meeting her, if he
couldn't tell her that he knew her husband. It left me wondering, how
sensitive of a person could he really have become, if he could only help
her materially and not understand that his drinking masked deeper
problems he had in his character, such as lying! What I never quite
understood, is why he has to make amends to her, since he had nothing to
do with the accident and was actually helping her husband out by giving
him the free ticket. He might have hurt others during his callow period,
but I can't see how he purposely hurt Abby and her husband.</P>
<P>But the film had enough of a realistic romance under its belt to not be
buried for dead with its contrivances. In additition it had some pretty
good players in supporting roles. Joe Morton always gives a fine
performance, and here as the sturdy, no-nonsense businessman he grounds
the film in some needed reality. Johnny Galecki is around for some
levity and as the gay assistant to Affleck who fires away at his boss,
not afraid to confront him with opposition in the midst of his moral
dilemma. Caroline Aaron has the cardboard role as Abby's supportive
friend, but she's not intrusive and is pleasant in that role. Alex D.
Linz and David Dorfman are perfect as Abby's kids, trying to get a
handle on Affleck and recover themselves from not having a father
around, while receiving loving care from their harried mother. Jennifer
Grey is the airline rep who covers up for him when he switches tickets
with Greg and is believable in her small part.</P>
<P>This modest production scored with me. And if it didn't have that phony
civil court scene at the end, with Affleck forced to act in such a
disingenuously apologetic manner, the film would have been much better.
But I was glad to be taken in by what I was seeing onscreen, that is an
adult romantic film, with the adults interested in having a real
relationship. I'm so conditioned by now, that I think only foreign films
or art house films operate that way.</P>
