FLUBBER
Grade: D (Buy the Happy Meal, Skip the Flick)</PRE>
<P>Directed by Les Mayfield (Miracle on 34th street)
Written by John Hughes
Starring: Robin Williams, Marcia Gay Harden (Miller's Crossing), Ted 
Levine (The Silence of the Lambs), Clancy Brown (Blue Steel)
Year of Release: 1997
Rating: PG</P>
<P>Deserves Recognition for: Making this relatively youthful critic feel 
extremely old and crotchety20</P>
<P>Capsule Review:
    This is what feel-good family entertainment has morphed into in the 
90's: An hour-and-a-half commercial, disguised as an unnecessary 
remake, in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a 
volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass. (Between this, 
Rocketman, and George of the Jungle, Disney has recently eclipsed 
longtime champion Troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke 
in a film.) As the absent-minded professor who invents the titular 
computer-generated goop, a listless Robin Williams manages the difficult 
task of making original lead Fred MacMurray seem sprightly.
    The only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my 
newly-founded but firm belief that writer/producer John Hughes is going 
to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the 
different blunt instruments he's used for comedic effect in films like 
this and the odious Home Alone series. Take your kids to see Boogie 
Nights instead.</P>
