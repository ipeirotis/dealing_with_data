RATING: 9/10</PRE>
<P>This is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it
just happens to be animated. There are some great voice over commentaries
from Hollywood's most famous celebrities, some fabulous animation and a
compelling story. This is the best we've seen from Disney since "Beauty and
the Beast" (1996).</P>
<P>This film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after
conclusion to Toy Story. In the aftermath of their earlier adventures, Buzz
(voice of Tim Allen) and Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) are now fast friends and
all the toys live in perfect harmony, content with their "lives". One day,
Andy broke Woody's arm off, while playing with him. Woody is now officially
discarged and worthless, left with his
nightmares, where he lies in a trash can with the other discards.
Later Andy's mother decides to have a yard sale, and she collects a few old
toys
from her son's room. Since one of these discards is a member of the moving
toy gang, Woody goes to the rescue, leaving the safety of the house for the
uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back. Although his
mission is successful, he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy
collector
named Al (voice of Wayne Knight) spies Woody while hunting through the wares
available at the sale. The cowboy toy represents the final collectible
needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old TV series,
"Woody's Roundup." If he can acquire Woody, Al can ship everything to a toy
museum in Japan for a huge profit. So, after Andy's mother refuses to sell
the wooden cowboy, Al steals him, and it's up to the other toys, led by
Buzz, to go into the city to save their friend. And so,  Buzz, Rex (voice of
Wallace Shawn), Hamm (voice of John Ratzenberger), Mr. Potatohead (voice of
Don Rickles), and Slinky (voice of Jim Varney), go out on a dangerous
journey to rescue their friend, they find themselves confronting things like
busy streets and other Buzz Lightyear toys. There are car chases, gun fights
and finally the confrontation between Buzz and his Nemesis (who, by the way,
resembles Darth Vader). Meanwhile, Woody learns that he was once a TV
celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named Jessie (voice of Joan Cusack),
a horse named Bullseye, and a father figure called the Prospector (voice of
Kelsey Grammar). They offer him another life, as a celebrity -- a toy in a
museum in Japan. He is now forced to choose between being loved intensively
by Andy for a little while (before he grows up) and be forgotten, or be
admired by children for generations. The problem is, if Woody escapes from
Al's clutches and returns home, they will end up back in the lonely darkness
of storage.</P>
<P>A real effort is made in the technical department. The animation is rich and
colorful, with lots of wonderful details. The "cinematography" is also
extremely improved since Toy Story; there are a lot of complicated swings,
turns and close-ups that really make an impression. Lighting and filters are
used to create a mood (as in a surprisingly emotional moment - Jessie's
remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy) The film contains a lot
of in-side jokes (such as the one about videogames), and entertaining
parodies on "Jurassic Park" and "Star Wars". The film ends with the "failed
takes", the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on TV.
These outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film. But what in the
end makes "Toy Story 2" a memorable experience is not the jokes, its
multiple parodies or marvelous animation. It is its heart and emotions --
the story about the meaning of friendship, love and even life itself. It is
not difficult to predict that "Toy Story 2" would be a huge economical
success, but its artistic achievement was unexpected. Unexpected because the
first film wasn't much more than a demonstration of special effects. But
mostly it was unexpected because Disney hasn't produced anything spectacular
in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as DreamWorks and
Warner Brs. But here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film,
making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years.
This is a big step-away from the ancient laws of Disney-animation. Off
course, this is not "Antz" , it is not as intelligent; this is not a
landmark and no masterpiece, but I promise that you'll find it as funny and
enjoyable as I have. Whether this is the best animated film of the year, I
dare not say. My choice would probably be "The Iron Giant", but (along side
with "American Pie" ) this is the comedy of the year.</P>
<P>I almost lost my hopes for Disney, but "Toy Story 2" proves that Disney
hasn't lost their ability to entertain.</P>
