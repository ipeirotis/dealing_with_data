<P>"Virus" is the type of cliched, vacuous film that has been recylcled so 
many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting 
work into making it. Strangely enough, on the same mid-January weekend 
last year, another film was released like this, "Deep Rising," about an 
ugly monster on a cruise liner. Prior movies with the almost exact same 
storyline include 1989's "Leviathan," 1989's "Deep Star Six," and all 
four "Alien" pictures. "Virus," in comparison, is a servicable thriller, 
well-made and produced, but since it doesn't include one moment of even 
remote originality or intelligence, it sinks under the weight of the 
water that the film was shot on.</P>
<P>Based on a series of comic books, "Virus" concerns the crew of an ocean 
salvage tugboat, which becomes extremely damaged during a violent 
typhoon. After discovering that the boat is slowly sinking, (un)lucky 
for them, a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns 
up within the confines of their radar screen. Once the team reaches the 
Russian ship, they go on board to find that the place is seemingly 
deserted. After turning the power back on, however, there gradually are 
signs that something else is on the ship, and the electrical equipment 
is oddly working by itself. One survivor finally does turn up, Nadia 
(Joanna Pacula), who informs the suicidal and stern captain (Donald 
Sutherland) and one of the crew, Kit Foster (Jamie Lee Curtis), that a 
mysterious alien life form hit the Santi Mir space station which then 
was transported down to the ship, taking over the minds of all of the 
electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be 
completely wiped out.</P>
<P>If "Virus" sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies, you're 
correct. Although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring 
the mechanical creature to life, the film itself doesn't appear to have 
a brain in its head. The film sticks so close to the worn-out 
conventions of the "creature" genre that it is amazing anyone would 
spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an 
original film.</P>
<P>The actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities 
in the past, but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have 
characters to play. In her second return to horror in the last year, 
Jamie Lee Curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful 
heroine, but that is about it. Although 1998's "Halloween: H20" was also 
a disappointment, at least she was given a few scenes to develop a 
character, unlike here. Donald Sutherland has fallen on hard times 
recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films, such as 1994's "The 
Puppet Masters," although I just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi 
classic "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," where he was fabulous. The 
last of the three top-billers is William Baldwin, but it is fairly hard 
to say if he is good or not in the picture, since he has nothing to do.</P>
<P>Basically, "Virus" is another one of those films where a group of people 
walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until 
the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills 
them one-by-one. It is not the worst of its type, but it is far from one 
of the best, and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling 
such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this? As long as some 
of them keep making money, I suspect the answer is never.</P>
