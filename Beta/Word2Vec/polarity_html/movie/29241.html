<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Considered to be the first modern gangster film, where the criminals are the
antihero heroes. Underworld was adapted from ex-reporter Ben Hecht's book, where
he uses his experiences covering the Chicago crime scene. Sternberg had a
different vision for the film and after the opening chaotic scenes were told
like a straight crime story, the director changed the reality of the silent film
and abandoned Hecht's version. Sternberg gave this film a blend of realism,
German expressionism and Hollywood sentimentality. The evidence of  Sternberg's
rich imagination first comes into evidence during the gangster's ball scene. </P>
<P>The film opens by introducing Bull Weed (George Bancroft) as a bank robber. He
robs a bank by dynamiting it and before driving away he gives a blind beggar
some money. The now down-and-out former lawyer called Rolls Royce (Clive Brook),
witnessed the robbery in his drunken condition and when discovered by Bull has
to convince him that he's no squealer in order to live. </P>
<P>Bull's sweetie pie is Feathers McCoy (Evelyn Brent). Sitting in their favorite
bar, Dreamland, they meet the drunk again when they witness him being humiliated
by a rival of Bull's called Buck Mulligan (Fred Kohler). He wants to impress the
sexy Feathers that he doesn't care about money, as he's second fiddle to Bull in
this town and lusts after what Bull has--especially the Feathers dame. So he
throws a $10 bill in the spittoon and orders the alcoholic janitor, Rolls Royce,
to pick it up or else he'll kill him. Bull comes to the rescue and gives Rolls
Royce a large stake to clean himself up. He soon realizes that Rolls Royce is an
intellectual, and he hires him to plan their robberies and be the brains of the
organization. This works out fine, as Bull is even more successful than before
and becomes the uncrowned king of the Chicago underworld. </P>
<P>In one robbery, Rolls Royce has Bull drop a flower at the crime scene in order
to frame Buck Mulligan. You see, Buck, as a front for his criminal activities,
owns a flower shop. </P>
<P>Rolls Royce moves into Bull's hideout, and falls in love with Feathers and she
gradually falls in love with him. But he's too grateful for what Bull did for
him to carry out this love. At the annual underworld's ball, where everyone
attending has a prison record, jealousy and rage erupt in the middle of all the
party favors as confetti and streamers fill the dance hall. Bull bawls Rolls
Royce out for dancing with his girl, and soon gets so drunk he's passed out.
This gives Buck a chance to attack the helpless Feathers. But Buck's jealous
girlfriend (Helen Lynch) wakes Bull up and he comes to Feathers rescue by
killing Buck with his gat. </P>
<P>Sentenced to hang for the murder and hearing rumors about his girl with Rolls
Royce, the climactic scenes show how he breaks out of prison and returns to his
hideout seeking revenge. Here he confronts Rolls Royce and Feathers and finds
that they remained faithful to him; and, most importantly, he learns something
about himself that he didn't know before. He discovers his deeper feelings, as
he decides to give himself up to the police. </P>
<P>Bull was portrayed as a burly, physical man with complex emotions. He always
wanted to elevate Feathers in stature and enjoyed doing it in a crass way, as he
gave her jewelry as presents. That he could be generous as well as ruthless and
had a laugh that could fill a room with his giant personality, made him a
villain who was not one-dimensional. </P>
<P>During its time this was an edgy film, but the times have changed and its story
doesn't hold up as well today. It's a film that is mostly interesting for its
historical contribution to cinema, as it set the conventions for this genre. It
is also a visually challenging film, as Sternberg filled the screen with symbols
and imagery it had never seen before. This changed the way gangster films were
made, and the visuals of this film are still considered to be innovative and
stylish. </P>
<P>Some critics have classified this as an example of film noir mainly because of
all the alienation and corruption shown. It's not like the film noir of the
1940s, but more like a noir predecessor. </P>
<P>Interestingly enough, at the first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929, the film
received its only award, for story writer Ben Hecht. Hecht gladly accepted the
award, even though he complained about the finished film when it first came out
and wanted his name taken off the credits. </P>
