<P>     I have no objection to violence and gore in the movies -- even 
extreme violence and gore -- as long as it serves a purpose (see 
GOODFELLAS, PULP FICTION, and even SCREAM for examples).  In NIGHTWATCH, 
however, the most explicit and extreme instances of bloodletting are 
designed exclusively to titillate or horrify, depending on the viewer's 
tolerance and point-of-view.  Apparently, director Ole Bornedal 
(remaking his own 1994 Danish hit, NATTEVAGTEN) recognized how thin and 
contrived his script was, and attempted to plug the holes with something 
warm, wet, and sticky.  As either a slasher/horror flick or a murder 
mystery/thriller, NIGHTWATCH is a failure.</P>
<P>     The film's distribution history -- or lack thereof -- is a tip-off 
that something is wrong.  When a studio believes it has a winner, it 
rushes the product out to theaters as quickly as possible.  With 
NIGHTWATCH, Miramax has taken exactly the opposite approach, holding the 
movie in stasis for 18 months (it was originally supposed to be released 
in October 1996).  Anyone hoping for some quality entertainment will 
realize that this is not a good sign. </P>
<P>     Most of the action, such as it is, takes place within a morgue, and 
Bornedal makes it a suitably creepy place, with long, silent corridors, 
flickering fluorescent lights, and dancing shadows.  Atmosphere is 
NIGHTWATCH's strongest asset.  When the new night watchman, Martin (Ewan 
McGregor), makes his first rounds through the eerily silent building, we 
sense his anxiety and the oppressive claustrophobia engendered by the 
place.  Sadly, it's all downhill from there as the movie devolves into 
something that is simultaneously familiar and ridiculous.</P>
<P>     Martin has taken this job because he believes the long hours of 
solitude will allow him time to study.  His girlfriend, Catherine (an 
underused Patricia Arquette), doesn't like his temporary career choice, 
although his best friend, James (Josh Brolin), is fascinated by it.  But 
James is a strange person with a penchant for playing bizarre and 
potentially-dangerous practical jokes, and his fascination with bodies 
and body parts may point to something dark within him.  Meanwhile, 
Martin is on duty the night that the latest victim of a serial killer is 
brought in.  The police detective in charge of the case, Cray (Nick 
Nolte, suffering a bad hair day), reveals to Martin that all of the 
victims have one thing in common:  their eyes have been gouged out.  
Soon, as part of one of James' practical jokes, Martin comes into 
contact with a prostitute named Joyce (Alix Koromzay) who not only was 
the friend of one of the killer's victims, but may be in danger herself.</P>
<P>     Aside from the atmosphere, which gradually dissipates as the plot 
takes off, NIGHTWATCH doesn't have much to offer.  The identity of the 
killer is revealed too early (although, to be fair, it's easy to guess 
who it is about 30 minutes before the camera finally pans to his face) 
and the convoluted means by which he sets Martin up to take the fall are 
laughably absurd.  Bornedal appears to be disregarding every aspect of 
police procedure and forensic technology by allowing something so 
blatantly outrageous to seem even vaguely possible.  Hitchcock's movies 
often had plot holes, but never were they this obvious to viewers while 
the film was in progress (most were unearthed during post-screening 
discussions).  Then there's the dialogue which, in trying to be 
profound, frequently ends up sounding silly.  We get lines like this 
one:  "If it can't be experienced, it's just meaningless chaos." </P>
<P>     The acting is less-than-inspired.  Ewan McGregor (sporting a hit-
and-miss American accent), who has become a sought-after commodity 
following his outing in TRAINSPOTTING (so much so that George Lucas 
pegged him to play Obi-Wan Kenobi in the new STAR WARS film), has a few 
effective scenes, but, for the most part, he's bland.  Josh Brolin is 
over-the-top, but I suppose that's the intention.  And Nick Nolte gives 
what is likely his worst performance since ANOTHER 48 HOURS.  The only 
one who's any good is Brad Dourif as a doctor with the personality of a 
ghoul.</P>
<P>     My patience for dumb thrillers, where the audience is always about 
ten steps ahead of the characters, is wearing very thin.  If not for 
Bornedal's stylish approach to the material and a couple of effectively 
chilling sequences, NIGHTWATCH would have been a complete waste of time 
and effort.  As it is, it's still not worth more than an unenthusiastic 
video recommendation, which is the medium in which most interested 
viewers will end up seeing it, since its box office life is likely to be 
deservedly short.</P>
