THE GINGERBREAD MAN
Starring Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davidzt and Robert Downey, Jr.</PRE>
<P>Written by John Grisham and Robert Altman (as Al Hayes)</P>
<PRE>Directed by Robert Altman</PRE>
<P>Some time ago, a young director was given the opportunity to direct the 
screen version of a popular novel. The novel was a summer smash, topping 
best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as 
to which popular actors of the day might play the leads. The only 
problem: the novel wasn't very good. It was far more pulp than 
Pulitzer. But the director realized that, no matter how pedestrian the 
prose, this book really grabbed people - that the author, while not a 
great writer, was a fantastic storyteller. So he took on the project, 
convinced he could make something happen on screen.
The director? Francis Ford Coppola. The book, of course, was Mario 
Puzo's THE GODFATHER. The rest, as they say in showbiz, was history.</P>
<P>By bringing up THE GODFATHER, I don't mean to suggest that Robert 
Altman's THE GINGERBREAD MAN is destined for that level of greatness. 
But the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema 
from questionable source material. Can you get any more questionable 
than John Grisham? Depends on whom you ask. But there's no question 
that Grisham's work grabs people. Like Puzo, Grisham is a better 
storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack Michael Crichton, who is 
a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can 
of Spam. So something in Grisham's unpublished story of a cocky 
Savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the 
attention of Robert Altman, who at 73 years old remains one of 
America's greatest living filmmakers. The result is a gripping 
thriller that, while falling short of classic cinema, deserves its place 
in the Altman canon.</P>
<P>>From its opening shot to the closing credits, THE GINGERBREAD MAN is 
permeated with a sense of dread, with a fear of the natural destructive 
forces of the universe. This terrific sense of mood is a classic Altman 
touch. Witness said opening shot: we see an aerial view of coastal 
Georgia with its writhing, undulating landscape while the soundtrack 
grumbles ominously in our ear. We roll over the hills into the town of 
Savannah, then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge 
while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone. Right away we 
know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises. Pay 
attention, boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by John 
Grisham, but by Altman. This is what a great director can do for 
questionable source material.</P>
<P>The sports car belongs to Rick Magruder (Kenneth Branagh), the 
aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality 
cases. Magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that 
night with a catered party at his office. Outside after the party he 
meets one of the waitresses, Mallory Doss (Embeth Davidzt), just as she 
realizes her car has been stolen. Driven by Southern chivalry, a driving 
rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress, Magruder 
offers her a ride home. There he learns more about Mallory's life than 
he bargained for. Her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father Dixon 
(Robert Duvall), a Ted Kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and 
terrorizing his own daughter. Magruder, perhaps influenced by 
Mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him, is 
sympathetic to her plight, and offers to help her get her father 
committed - right after he sleeps with her, of course.</P>
<P>This simple offer of help leads Magruder down a dangerous path with a 
black end. He succeeds in having Dixon incarcerated in a mental 
hospital, and for a moment all appears well. But then Dixon's crack 
team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly 
Magruder finds himself, Mallory and his own children in danger. The cops 
won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney. His only allies are 
his faithful assistant Lois (Daryl Hannah) and his bumbling private-eye 
sidekick Clyde (Robert Downey Jr). If this predicament wasn't bad 
enough, Hurricane Geraldo is bearing down on Savannah and throwing the 
world into chaos.</P>
<P>Altman may provide the atmosphere, but Branagh's performance holds THE 
GINGERBREAD MAN together. An accomplished actor when he isn't 
directing himself in vanity productions, Branagh does a fine job of 
making Rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives. Is 
his offer of help to Mallory an act of kindness, or of egotism? Magruder 
is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has 
bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by 
then it's too late. As the plot unfolds, Magruder learns that none of 
us are as secure as we think we are. And life is never so bad that it 
can't get worse.</P>
<P>If you're familiar with Altman's work, you'll recognize several of 
his signature techniques. Characters are not introduced in establishing 
shots, but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes 
until their importance becomes apparent. Crucial scenes are shot from 
the outside through windows, making the audience unwitting voyeurs of 
the action. Dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into 
an improvisational style. And of course there's my favorite Altman 
technique - the Obligatory Nude Actress shot. Thanks to Altman, here 
are some of the actresses I've had the pleasure of seeing naked: Sally 
Kellerman, Julianne Moore, Madeline Stowe, even Frances McDormand. And 
now I can add Embeth Davidtz, who looks quite healthy in the altogether. 
The naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the Altman film as 
the director cameo was to the Hitchcock film. Is it old-school sexism, 
or a clever in-joke? You be the judge.</P>
<P>But back to the picture at hand. In the hands of a mere mortal, THE 
GINGERBREAD MAN would have been a routine thriller, no better or worse 
than the countless others we've all endured. In the hands of a master 
like Altman, it becomes an exercise in existential doom, in its own way 
far more successful than Scorsese's CAPE FEAR remake, which tried for 
the same result. What may prevent it from enduring with Altman's 
greatest work is a weak third act - in fact, there really is no third 
act in Grisham's story, so it appears that Altman had to throw in the 
hurricane just to jazz things up. But there are true moments of riveting 
suspense, and great performances by Branagh, Davidzt and Downey Jr - 
more than enough to see you through. That Polygram so hated this picture 
that they tried to steal final cut from Altman, and then buried the 
marketing campaign when he won it back, should tell you how utterly 
clueless of quality most studios are. They probably wanted it to look 
more like A TIME TO KILL. And that, my friends, should make you very 
afraid.</P>
