<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An artistically moody puzzler built around the mystery of five sisters
in a wealthy small Michigan suburban town who committed suicide twenty
five years ago (the story takes place in the 1970s, as evidenced by the
background music of Styx and Electric Light Orchestra). The film is
narrated offscreen by Giovanni Ribisi, as an adult looking back at that
time with all the physical evidence the locals collected about the
girls. The recollections of the girls is by their boy classmates, the
ones who lusted after their dream girls and their perceptions are
admittedly drawn from their limited experiences with the girls and from
anything they found in the girls's house afterwards, such as Cecilia's
diary and photos of the girls. It is richly adapted from a Jeffrey
Eugenides novel by director Sofia Coppola.</P>
<P>The film is an evocative visual depiction of a typical suburban family
and community. It dwells on the sadness found under all the attractive
girls's smiling faces, leaving one with a lingering feeling of
helplessness about their situation. Adolescence is scrutinized by Sofia
Coppola in a cinematically crafted manner, finely inspired by what we
think we remember about that age when looking back at it, with the
implication that the girls at that time knew more about the boys than
the other way around. The boys, except for one, are insecure and clumsy
around the girls.</P>
<P>Edward Lachman's photography has a mesmerizing look to it, as he seems
to have his camera covered with a filter to make the shots appear fuzzy,
which complements a story that can't be completely put together because
we don't know the answers as to why the girls' did what they did. All we
are left with are some clues to what set the tragedy off and our mind
associations take over as we are left trying to rationalize what we
can't understand.</P>
<P>The first Lisbon girl to go the suicide route was the lovely but unhappy
youngest one, the 13-year-old, Cecilia (Hanna Hall), who first attempts
suicide by jumping off her house roof onto a spiked fence but fails, and
is sent to a shrink (Danny DeVito) for observation. To cheer her up, her
very strict Catholic mother (Kathleen Turner) throws her a party in the
house. At some point during the party, Cecilia retreats upstairs and
succeeds in slitting her wrists.</P>
<P>The distraught father (James Woods), a math teacher in the high school,
is viewed as a decent but unassertive weakling. He deals with the
tragedy afterwards by watching a baseball game, unable to talk with the
girls or the priest who came by to comfort the family.</P>
<P>With the girls back in school, the attractive and sexually inviting Lux
(Kirsten Dunst) has the school's lady man, the handsome guy who walks
with a swagger, Trip (Josh Hartnett), go wild over her. Their romance is
hampered by Mrs. Lisbon not allowing her daughters to go out on dates
alone. But Trip comes up with a plan so that all the girls can have
dates with his friends and attend the high school homecoming dance
together, where Mr. Lisbon will be the chaperone. The promise is made to
return before curfew, but Trip and Lux get carried away with their
passion for each other and make it on the football field, thereby
breaking the curfew. But Trip leaves her alone in the field and will
never see her again after that most perfect night, as he is now
interviewed about her as an adult and says he liked her, she was his
dream girl, and can't explain why he left her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lisbon goes overboard on the punishment and the girls are
indefinitely grounded from all activities and forced to remain home. The
emasculated father is overwhelmed by all the women around him and
retreats from the crisis he is facing at home, by saying nothing to his
wife about the vindictive punishment dished out.</P>
<P>Within a year of the youngest Lisbon's death, the other four follow suit
after sneaking out for a car ride into the early morning hours with the
high school boys. The 15-year-old Bonnie (Chelse Swain), hangs herself;
the 16-year-old Mary (A. J. Cook) sticks her head in the oven; the
17-year-old Therese (Leslie Hayman) does it by sleeping pills, and the
narrator tells us the last one to go was the 14-year-old Lux, who
handled her confinement by sneaking boys on the house roof for random
sex, as viewed by the neighborhood boys with their expensive telescope.</P>
<P>Despite liking much about the film and respecting the eclectic approach
the director used, I still found that this film wasn't talking to me. I
felt I was asked to be a mourner at a once in a lifetime story that has
the possibility to pop up some day on the TV news as one of those
bizarre events that just happen without cause, but the story itself went
no deeper than how the TV news would cover it. The exploration of the
teens in their growing pains, their ordinary wants, and even in their
grandeur, left me scratching my head at this allegorical tale, wondering
how it was that the sunshine couldn't get inside them, why they were
symbolically cut down in life like the diseased elm tree in front of
their house was, where I could at least see the disease in the tree's
yellow leaves. As for the girls, aside from their horribly repressed,
overbearing mother, Where was the monster lurking in them that made them
feel so despondent? I don't know how much of their futility I could see,
as the more I thought about them, the more they seemed like ghosts than
real people, and they all started looking like each other, so I couldn't
distinguish one from the other, except for Lux, who for some reason in
all her boldness and sexuality, couldn't find the strength to live.
Which left me perplexed as to why the film thrived on not telling a
complete story. If I tried to know more about the girls, I would only
become like the shrink, giving off pat answers to something that was
supposed to remain a mystery. I don't know if this is a good or a bad
way for a film to leave the viewer, but I do know I felt something
profound was missing here, as the film was more revealing about the boys
and their idealization of the girls than it was about the girls and what
they were really like. This seemed misplaced storytelling, since the
girls' story should have been more compelling than the boys' awkward
adolescent tale was. What I got out of the story was a peak at life in
the suburbs and about awkward adolescent boys only looking at the girls
through what they fantasized about them. What saves this film, is the
innovative way the director filmed the story, covering up the fluff to
make the story look deeper than it was.</P>
