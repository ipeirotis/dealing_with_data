<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This is a grim morality tale that can't help putting you in someone
else's shoes, wondering what you would do if you were in the same
situation. It is also a "coming-of-age" film, testing a youngster'
mettle to rise above his dire circumstances. It is seen through the
troubled eyes of a slender 15-year-old blond, living in Liege, Belgium,
named Igor (Renier). He has lost his childlike innocence, already being
a petty crook and a breaker of the law, but is still sexually innocent.
He is living with and helping out his single-parent father by doing the
dirty work his father is counting on him to do that keeps his unsavory
business going. His father, who insists Igor call him by his Christian
name, Roger (Gourmet), has a construction business where he employs
illegal immigrants, and exploits and traffics in them. They come from
all over the world but mostly from Bosnia and Africa. His love for his
son is so twisted and wrongly placed, even if it is some form of love
that he offers, that it still results in his son being raised by a
monster: keeping him out of school, at a distance from his regular teen
friends, allowing him to smoke cigarettes freely, even tattooing him
with the same tattoo he has; and, the worst thing he does, is corrupt
him with a false set of values, while having the audacity to tell him
that he is doing all these illicit things for his sake.</P>
<P>On the day that the government inspectors appear at the work site, the
illegals are told to hide from the inspectors. One of the illegals,
Amidou (Rasmane), from Burkina Faso, falls from a scaffold and needs to
be rushed to the hospital. Igor drags him out of the inspector's sight,
but not before Amidou makes him promise that if he dies he will look
after his wife and baby. When Roger finishes showing the inspectors
around and discovers Amidou is severely injured, he refuses to take him
to the hospital afraid that he doesn't know what to tell the hospital
has happened without arousing their suspicions. Instead, he does the
most savage thing he could possibly do, he gets Igor, who is becoming
very squeamish at this point, to help him bury Amidou in concrete, even
if he is aware that Amidou is still barely alive.</P>
<P>How cruel can people be to others! ...  As for Roger there was no
question about it, his generosity did not include those outside of his
small circle; and, immigrants and especially black ones were barely even
human to him. But something has happened to the kid. He has developed a
sense of guilt, knowing full-well he has done something wrong, and he
also knows that he is trapped, he has to make a decision one way or the
other, either be with his father or help the widow. Whichever way he
goes, there will be a price to pay for him, he will not be able to
satisfy both parties. Going with his father is morally wrong, but
perhaps easier for him and a more understandable choice, considering
that his other choice is with a people he knows nothing about. But the
other choice he understands is the right one, and he wrestles with his
conscience as he tries to help the widow without hurting his father.</P>
<P>LA PROMESSE has the harsh reality to it that a documentary might have,
and considering that the sibling film directors are acclaimed
documentary directors for over two decades, it is easy to see that even
though this story is fictionalized it, neverthess, is filmed in the
manner of the very real experiences that the filmmakers have noted going
on in modern Europe. The illegals, on the bottom end of the totem pole,
with no legal right granted them to be where they are, are at the mercy
of such heartless and bigoted people as these who swoon down upon them
as vultures.</P>
<P>The three main characters of the story are cast perfectly. Igor
indicates by his facial expressions that he wants to be a kid again but
can't, as he learns how to face up to the different situations that keep
popping up in his life. When we first meet him he is seen as a slick
liar and petty thief, swiping a woman's wallet, and then we see him as
he gradually changes and develops an empathy for the widow of the
immigrant, maybe, even thinking of her as the mother he doesn't have but
certainly needs. He watches with a warm scrutiny as she fiercely tries
to protect her child from all the outside evils.</P>
<P>The film could have been done from the father's point of view instead of
the son's; and, even more interestingly, from Assita's (the widow) way
of seeing things, and the film would have still had a tremendous impact.
She has a regality about her that is peerless, even when she is
searching for the truth about her husband's disappearance, not satisfied
with the stories Roger and Igor are telling her. When she is left
stranded under a trestle and two Belgians piss on her, as they are
perched above her, we see in her anger and frustration, that she is lost
in a country of white people she does not understand. But there is an
unmistakable presence she has, that clearly shows the nobility of her
character, especially when contrasted with all those around her whose
minds are so blemished.</P>
<P>Roger is one of the slimiest guys you could ever meet, someone who tries
to pretend he is good but it so obviously not, that it is written all
over him what he really is. But the character he has is fitting for the
person he is. There is room for us to see in him what makes him act the
way he does, that he is not that far removed from the consciousness' of
the ordinary man in the street, except for his utter lack of decorum and
any sort of social conscience. From his point of view, we could see that
he is only looking out for number one, thinking, that if he doesn't, who
else will. An argument you will frequently hear from the man in the
street, as he tries to rationalize his vices.</P>
<P>To further contrast the differing white and black cultures, we see how
the Western medical profession treatment of her differs from the one she
intuitively trusts, as she goes to a witch doctor. Igor's guilt-ridden
help, results in Assita being taken to a hospital to find out why her
baby is so sick. But they can't see anything wrong. So she consults an
African spiritualist. He determines that she can save the baby by going
to see relatives in Italy, that there is nothing that she can accomplish
here, the baby is telling her to leave.</P>
<P>When the young Igor can't live with his father's cruel dishonesty
anymore, one of the more powerful confrontational scenes imaginable
takes place between a father and son, as the son removes the mental
shackles he has worn all his life and places real chains on his father.
He walks out on him, choosing to help Assita get out of the country,
rather than remain with his father. In a strange way, without him or her
being conscious of it, she became his surrogate mother.</P>
<P>This powerful tale is unflinchingly honest and moving. It casts a dark
shadow over a civilized country's technological prowess in the world,
and questions its humanity and moral perspectives. It does so in a most
tangible way, in a way that should be a disturbing reminder of how
complex the problem of immigration is, in a film that is piercingly on
target as a challenge for the European countrys to keep their "promise"
to the immigrants and to see how corrupt their system is and how it
doesn't really stop these powerless people from being exploited.</P>
