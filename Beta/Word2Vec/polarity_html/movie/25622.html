<P>   To paraphrase Tolstoy, middle class families are all alike
but slum dwellers are different in their own ways.  Those who
are ghettoized in America's inner cities suffer the pathologies
of isolation, but trendy middle-class kids often mimic their
style of dress, walk and talk. Those who are ghettoized in
Scotland's inner cities suffer as well, but have not formed a
distinct culture that any of their more prosperous countrymen
would want to echo.  In Lynne Ramsay's first feature film,
"Ratcatcher," the anguish of living in one of Glasgow's slums
during the 1970s is accentuated by a strike of the garbage
collectors, known there as dust-men, and through some
striking imagery Ramsay captures the ambience of a series
of miserable blocks in a Glaswegian tenement district.</P>
<P>   The film focuses on an expressive 12-year-old lad named
James (William Eadie), whose impoverished family have been
waiting for the local council people to move them from a rat-
infested area to three-bedroom digs situated in a rural area. 
While James occasionally laughs, particularly in moments of
affection for his sister and while watching his parents cuddle
with each other in some rare flashes, he is an unhappy young
man whose life has been made just a bit more miserable
because he has unwittingly caused the death of a playmate. 
When James's friend falls into a canal near home, James
makes no effort to save him or to alert his family to the
tragedy; yet because of his age and his limited outlook, he
feels only a limited sense of guilt that a more mature man
would be expected to comprehend.  </P>
<P>   The film opens on a young boy being pressured by his
mother to visit his father, but the boy runs off to play and is
pushed into a canal by James while the two are having a
mud fight, and somehow drowns.  While a more commercial
film might deal with the tragedy by taking off on the theme of
this accidental homicide, Ramsay instead takes us on a
journey into the small world of which James is a part.  We
are introduced to his dad (Tommy Flanagan), who is a drunk
but who expresses his affection from time to time for those in
his family; his mom (Mandy Matthews), who survives on her
hopes for the new home; Margaret Anne (Leanne Mullen),
who is sexually exploited by the local gang but whose
motives in passively accepting the boys are unexplored; and
Kenny (John Miller), James's animal-loving pal, who dreams
of being a zookeeper.</P>
<P>   Lynne Ramsay's movie tolerates occasional rough editing,
and the story is episodic rather than tightly-knit--and
deliberately so.  The director is intent on conveying the
ambience of slum life in Scotland's largest city thirty years
ago and appears to pay homage to Francois Truffaut's 1959
masterpiece, "The 400 Blows."  But she departs from the
French director's theme by portraying young people who
spend their days in routine petty mischief and casual sexual
exploits where Truffaut emphasized the life of small-time
crime among Parisian youth who are reacting to derelict
parents.  Ramsay's strongest point is not the story, since this
Ken Loach-like tale is scarcely an original take on the lower
depths.  Instead she hits an emotional chord in her audience
by a series of masterly images, the best being a surreal shot
of a pet mouse which Kenny shackles to a basket and, with
the help of a toy balloon launches the rodent all the way to
the moon.   If James cannot be equally airborne, he can
escape from the blunt dramas of his sordid family life by
taking a bus trip as far as he has ever been--to a corn field
on which sits the half-finished house that his family hopes
soon to inhabit.</P>
<P>   William Eadie's acting helps make this drama an
enlightening and intense experience.  Whether he joins his
fellows in taking out his frustrations by beating the huge rats
that inhabit the mountains of garbage on his block, or looks
with some hope on a future free of the lice-infested
neighborhood made all the worse during the dust-men's
strike, he is at the core of this naturalistic tale.  The final
scene is the piece de resistance, comparing James's actual
fate with what have been.</P>
