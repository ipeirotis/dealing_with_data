<P>Here is a film that is so unexpected, so scary, and so original that it
caught me off guard and threw me for a loop.  Okay, it isn't quite
original, considering it is a sequel to the box office hit SPECIES, but
it certainly is smart.  Most films of this genre are reminiscent of
those cheesy B-horror films from the 50s and 60s, and some even become
them.  However, as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi
film, sometimes expectations can be shattered.</P>
<P>A lot of criticism has gone against this film (from what I have read so
far, anyway--yep, all two reviews), and it makes me wonder why these
types of films are automatically dismissed as gory, laughable pieces of
trash.  But, the thing is, it isn't.  It's well made, well acted, and
quite intelligent.  I can see most of the critics now complaining about
the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film.  But the
SPECIES series isn't about the lack of these elements.  It's about how
much it can get into one film.  And yet, behind it all, it has this
basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so.</P>
<P>SPECIES II begins in the present day, though it seems to be an alternate
universe.  Many films (especially sci-fi ones) create similar timelines
as our realistic one, but change it to fit the film's needs.  SPECIES II
begins with the arrival of an American spacecraft, the Excursion,
landing on the surface of Mars.  Aboard is Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard),
a very bright and very handsome astronaut.  Patrick is the son of
Senator Ross (James Cromwell), who just wants Patrick to succeed.  Well,
it would seem that he has succeeded.  Landing on the surface of Mars, he
is the first human being to ever do so.  Of course, he isn't the first
ever.</P>
<P>About a billion years ago, an alien species supposedly landed on Mars
and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain
life.  Now, of course, the red planet is cold and rocky.  No life lives
on it.  That is, no visible life.  Patrick, upon leaving the spacecraft
and landing on the red soil, collects samples from the ground.   He
takes them aboard, and puts them in storage.  Unfortunately, one of the
samples contains a form of life, and it gets loose when it is heated
aboard the ship.  Just prior to heading back to Earth, this life form
creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings.  They pass out for
approximately seven minutes, and then shrug it off as nothing, because
they can't even remember.  They blame it on a technical malfunction.</P>
<P>Back on Earth, Patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many
women as possible.  As we know from the original, this is because the
alien wants to breed and take over the planet.  However, the children
that are bred are half-human, as their father is.  Patrick is really
looking for another alien to breed with, and he finds it in Eve (Natasha
Henstridge).  Eve was cloned from DNA taken from Sil, the original
alien.  However, this time around, most of her "alien" urges have been
either decreased dramatically, or lie dormant.  The project is led by
Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger, reprising her role from SPECIES),
and her motives seem respectable.  Since she was involved with the
original alien attack, she wants to learn how to stop the alien should
it come again.  And it has.</P>
<P>Story-wise, SPECIES II is much stronger than its predecessor, but it is
also much stronger than, say, ALIENS (hey, I love the film, but you
can't tell me it was strong on story).  What surprised me the most with
this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the
screenplay.  In my Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence course in
college, we learned about a piece of rock from Mars which landed in one
of the poles.  This piece of rock contained fossils which may have been
proof of life on Mars (later, it was proven that it was not a living
creature that created it).  The script uses this effectively, but also
manages to provide a well-balanced plot.  Beginning with the first man
on Mars (something I have always dreamed of seeing), I was hoping that
the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the
movie.  And it does it quite well.  The characters are all smart, and
they know what to do and what not to do.  The only character that seems
a little cliched is the General (George Dzundza), and yet, he remains
logical in everything he does.</P>
<P>There are the obvious flaws of course, mostly lying in the technical
aspects.  The special effects are only mediocre, and some are just plain
bad.  But for the most part, they remain believable (I even noticed a
homage to the ALIEN series when the mothers gave birth to alien
children).  Also, the most realistic ones are usually the goriest,
ranging from people being torn open, or someone's head being blown off.
However, some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience,
including a menage a troi that is all but necessary.  Many people
dislike the SPECIES series because all it is is an excuse for sex,
nudity, and gory violence.  However, I tend to disagree.  What were the
ALIEN films about?  And, if an alien species ever did come to Earth, and
their sole purpose was to destroy us, wouldn't you mate as quickly as
possible with as many people as possible?  My only gripe with this is
during the scene where Patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery
store.  I didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women
to mate with (I just assume it is his part-human side looking for the
most beautiful one).</P>
<P>The acting is quite good for this kind of film.  It is a vast
improvement over the first film, at least.  The acting is the key
element to this film: if it was bad, it would have lowered itself into
camp; if it was good, it would have asked for comparison with films like
ALIENS.  Okay, so it isn't THAT good.  George Dzundza is probably the
most obvious mistake on casting, as his over-the-top impersonation of a
general makes him annoying and distracting.  Natasha Henstridge is
limited this time around, as she is usually enclosed in a cage.
However, she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect
hindering any of her talent.  Oh yeah, and she's quite fun to just plain
watch.  Marg Helgenberger is immensely better this time around, and her
performance is probably the best in this film.  Michael Madsen is so-so,
but he isn't annoying, and he soon becomes rather appealing (with his
nice cynic personality).  James Cromwell has a small part, but he makes
it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable
actor.  As I say, any film with James Cromwell dramatically increases in
likeability.  Mykelti Williamson gives an enjoyable performance, and he
gives the film a more down-to-earth feel.  And, of course, Justin
Lazard.  Lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance, but I
think he is effective.  Sure, he is wooden, but isn't that what his
character is like?  The moment when he touches the glass separating
Henstridge from him was extremely well done, due to the couple's acting.</P>
<P>SPECIES II is rated R for strong sexuality, sci-fi violence/gore and
language.  This is definitely an R rated film that young kids should not
see.  More than likely, they would probably have nightmares and never
have sex for the rest of their lives.  Hell, I don't even know if I
will.  What is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be
the surprise film of the year.  I probably won't see another film where
I was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while.  Director
Peter Medak has crafted a very suspenseful, and sometimes very scary
movie out of a mediocre series.  Medak has also mastered the wonderful
"Jump!" moments, and has probably the second scariest moment I have ever
seen on film (SCREAM still has the first).  Strong acting, smart
dialogue, intelligent plotting, and a sure-handed director, SPECIES II
is exactly what these films should be: entertaining.</P>
