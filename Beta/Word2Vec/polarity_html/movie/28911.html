<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>Nobody does an adultery film quite the way the French do it. This melodrama is
no exception. In this sophisticated and realistic story a married woman, Mina
(Bouquet), falls in love with a married man and must decide if she wishes to
leave her older husband. The co-director Gérard Depardieu is also one of the
film's stars, and does a credible job in both roles. </P>
<P>This film is set in the small town of Yvet where Georges (Depardieu) finds
himself unemployed as his small masonry business couldn't generate enough
business and he is out of necessity forced to take a construction job building a
bridge in the town of Tancanville, which is just far enough away so he can't
commute. He stays in the workplace dorm for the week, but returns home to his
wife Mina and their 15-year-old scholarly son Tommy (Crevillen) every weekend. </P>
<P>The film opens as Mina and Tommy come out of the movie theater, "Le Royale,"
after seeing Truffaut's 1962 film "Jules and Jim" about a woman in love with two
men. There's nothing much to do in town, so Mina is a frequent movie-goer. Films
give her a chance to escape reality, as she excitedly tells Tommy: "Good movies
make me feel good." Also coming out of the theater is a wealthy woman she knows,
Claire Daboval (Reymont), and her pretty teenage daughter Lisbeth (Laurent). On
the spur of the moment, Claire offers Mina a job as a maid in her mansion. She
takes the part-time job, which is a bike ride away from her house, even though
Georges disapproves of her working. He feels it's a slap in his face. </P>
<P>While taking in a matinee of West Side Story, Mina sits next to a man who is
crying when the song Maria is sung (a little too corny for my taste). She meets
him outside the theater after the movie and finds out he's named Matthias
(Charles Berling) and is an engineer on the same bridge construction as her
husband. It's love at first sight for the both of them, and when Tommy comes
along they all go out together to a nightclub where she gets drunk and giddy
with laughter. She hasn't laughed with this intensity in a long time and when
she dances with him a strange feeling of joy comes over her. Georges is a nice
man, but there seems to be no magic in their relationship and she has grown
weary of it. Georges is a decent man who loves her with all his heart, which
makes her feel confused as this new relationship develops despite her first
impulse to resist it. It is able to flourish because Matthias is a relation of
the Dabovals and is staying there as a frequent guest until the bridge will be
completed in three years, and by chance they meet there. Complications arise
when Tommy resents what she is doing and finds himself lying to his father,
which is something he can't forgive himself for doing. Tommy has to come to
terms with this 
crisis in his parents' marriage while he's having a teenage relationship with
Lisbeth that might be serious. </P>
<P>The film builds to its climax as Mina's passion, onced opened up, can't be
stopped. She has tasted a sense of freedom and can't be denied her chance to
live out a more fantasy filled life. Her decision to leave the limited Georges
is a painful one for him and for Tommy, as well as a suffocating one for her. It
is intelligently handled, but somehow I did not find the film compelling.
Perhaps it was because Georges was painted as a dull man whose strength was in
his hands and in his decency, but who had no interest in fantasy. In the last
scene at the gas station, a bad imitation of the scene Jacques Demy brilliantly
did in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, Georges and Mina meet while filling up and
are going off in different directions. It now seems as if they were never meant
to be together. Georges' only change is that he bought a TV and doesn't plant
tomatoes anymore, while she just returned from skiing in the Alps and is living
an exciting upscale life. The scene had no real feeling to it, as it felt
forced. It seemed to crudely hammer out its point that adultery is a way of
escaping a boring marriage, and it seemed more interested in wrapping up the
film than in engaging the story with more life. </P>
<P>The film looks at this adultery from the view of the woman, which makes it
different from the way most films are done. It takes no stand on the adultery,
but what it does very well is catch the subtleties and complications that occur
in a very believable way. There is a lot of hurt to go around, which makes it a
bittersweet love story. </P>
<P>The Bridge is adapted from a book by Alain Leblanc. It relates how Mina who got
pregnant 15 years ago by a man she didn't love and by chance now meets an
exciting man she always dreamed about, but to do that she has to break the rules
of her middle-class life and go with him. What the film best points out is the
psychology of what such a tormented woman must go through to make such a
decision, because it will tear her family apart and make her think of herself as
a whore. The film is set in the Normandy region of the 1960s; it might not seem
as relevant today, as its old-fashioned story and French New Wave flavor of the
1960s loses a lot of the psychological impact for today's viewers. What it
savors, is the subtle performances of Bouquet, Depardieu, and Berling. Though,
without the middle-aged Carole Bouquet's touching characterization, this would
have been an impossible bridge to cross. </P>
