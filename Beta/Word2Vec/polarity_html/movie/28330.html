<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>This wonderful documentary on the life of Ramblin' Jack Elliott won the
Special Jury Award for Artistic Achievement at the 2000 Sundance Film
Festival. It is filmed by the 30ish Aiyanna Elliott, daughter of
Elliott's by the fourth wife, as she tries to connect with her errant
father. He's a father she never really knew and rarely ever saw. The
film's other aim is a loving tribute to his musical accomplishments and
his troubadour lifestyle of never settling down. His importance to the
music world is as the link between Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. He was
Guthrie's hand-picked protégé, learned from the master first-hand,
having lived with him in Brooklyn and was at his bedside during his
illness. He sang his songs in the Greenwich Village folk revival in
1961, and his country nasal style of singing was imitated by Dylan who
later on ignored Jack (this upset Jack's friends more than it did him,
until he was snubbed at the tribute for Woody and Dylan was the
headliner).</P>
<P>The film is enriched by extensive use of archival footage from as far
back as the 1930s, the film traces Jack's restless childhood in a
middle-class Jewish family. He was born in NYC in 1931 with the name
Elliot Adnopoz. His father was a medical doctor and expected Jack to
follow suit. His mother Flossie was an elementary school teacher and was
according to her elderly sister an overbearing person and not very
likable, who expected her son to live a conventional life. But this was
not to be, at age 15 Jack ran away from his private house in NYC and
joined the rodeo. There he learned how to be a cowboy and play the
guitar. His life's passion was to be a singing cowboy, and though he
returned to NYC (a place he hated) to finish high school he transformed
himself into a cowboy. Aware that legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie
was living in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, he gave him a call
one day and got invited to stay with him. He learned Woody's songs,
lived the ramblin' trip instead of just talking about it, and made
himself into a folk singing legend. But he never attained mainstream
popularity, prevented from doing so by his irresponsible and ramblin'
ways. His highmark in popularity came in 1969 when he appeared with
Johnny Cash in Nashville. During the 1970s he went into the tank, hurt
by his use of drugs. But he reemerged in the 1990s and continued
traveling and playing the guitar. In 1995 he hit it big-time with a
traditional folk album that won him national recognition at last, as he
won a Grammy. In 1998, President Clinton honored him by presenting him
with the National Medal of the Arts prize.</P>
<P>In 1955 he left his road travels in the States and spent 6 years playing
in London and touring Europe; he married the first of his wives, June
Shelley; but, because he lived life from moment to moment in a
disorganized fashion she would divorce him to live in a kibbutz in
Israel. He would return from London as a legend in 1961 to play to
packed crowds in Greenwich Village for the new folk music's trendy spot,
Gerde's Folk City. There he dressed cowboy style in a Stetson and boots
and jeans, looking out at the crowd through wire-rimmed glasses, picking
and yodeling his "traditional folk music." He's a jokester loving what
he was doing with a passion as he sang in a high reedy voice. By living
his life the way he wanted to and never being a planner or ambitious, he
caught the idiom of authentic American folk songs like few others have.
As folk singer Dave Van Ronk perceptively says, it's the music world's
gain he lived such a reckless life; that if he settled down and became a
family man he might have been happier but he wouldn't have been Ramblin'
Jack Eliott.</P>
<P>The film captures the spirit of Jack, as it wanders around to different
points of his life in a scattered order and has the cozy look of a
home-movie. The filmmaker, meanwhile, still does not know her father.
When he takes her on a drive in Mendocino to visit "the house where he
says we came closest to being a family" and he still can't find the
house, it is then that Aiyanna realizes how ill prepared her father was
to be a family man. She says out of frustration, she can't keep him
focused to talk about what she wants to know. She complains: "The thing
is, I can't remember having an actual conversation with my dad." Arlo
Guthrie (Woody's son) tells her, not to sweat it, that she never will
know her father. He should know, he was in the same situation.</P>
