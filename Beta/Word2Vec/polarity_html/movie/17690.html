<PRE>THE WINSLOW BOY
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 1999 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>It was a question of a mere 5 shillings, but it was enough in the early
1900s to get a 13-year-old boy sacked from the military college he
attended and enough to get the British nation outraged when his father
kept trying to get his son's case heard in court.</P>
<P>Writer and director David Mamet's THE WINSLOW BOY, loosely based on this
actual case, is gem of a picture in the spirit of THE AGE OF INNOCENCE.
Most of the action, such as it is, takes place on the sidelines.  People
talk about trials and possible trials rather than attending them.
Emotions are carefully held in check as they would have been in that
era, but the absolutely exquisite performances by the ensemble cast
insure that the characters' feelings are nonetheless intense even though
displayed with subtlety and grace.</P>
<P>As the story opens, Catherine Winslow, played with carefully controlled
spunk by Rebecca Pidgeon, has brought her intended husband, John (Aden
Gillett), home to her father so that the two men can discuss the
couple's future finances and the size of her dowry.  You may remember
Rebecca Pidgeon as the slick confidence scheme operator from Mamet's
last picture, THE SPANISH PRISONER.  She brings a compelling precision
and intelligence to all of her parts.</P>
<P>Academy Award nominee Nigel Hawthorne (THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE), in a
loving performance, plays Arthur Winslow, Catherine's father.  Arthur is
an honorable father who wants only the best for his kids and who is
willing to risk his family's limited fortune in its pursuit.  In a movie
with a lesser cast, Hawthorne's masterful performance would have stolen
the movie, but his turns out to be but one of many bright lights.</P>
<P>After the matter of the marriage finances is quickly settled, the
ensuing celebration is abruptly aborted when a dripping wet 13-year-old
Ronnie (Guy Edwards) is seen by his mother, Grace (Gemma Jones), hiding
in the garden.  It seems that he has been expelled from the Royal Naval
College for stealing a 5-shilling postal note.</P>
<P>Arthur, who has long ago established good relations with his son, wants
to know if the charge is true, but, before he allows the boy to answer,
he issues a stern but respectful admonition.  "If you tell me a lie, I
shall know, because a lie between us can't be hidden," he warns.  The
boy, who looks like innocence personified, swears that he's not guilty.
Mamet, the master of ambiguity and unanswered questions, makes you
wonder right away what the truth is and how that truth will be
determined.</P>
<P>As the nation gets wrapped up in "Save the Winslow Boy" fever, which we
see only through cartoons laid on desks and posters stuck on walls,
Arthur depletes his fortune trying with almost no success to get the
boy's case heard in some court.  Eventually Arthur decides that, if he
is to prevail, he must hire the best lawyer in the land, Sir Robert
Morton, who is also a leading Conservative Member of Parliament.</P>
<P>As the charismatic and handsome Sir Robert, Jeremy Northam delivers an
absolutely mesmerizing performance.  A highly intelligent man who keeps
his opponents and his supporters guessing what he will do next, Sir
Robert is a master legal and political strategist and the type of busy
man who allocates you only a few minutes of his precious time to see if
it's worth ever seeing you again.  He is also an outspoken opponent of
women's suffrage, which gives great pain to Catherine, who is a trade
union activist and a women's suffrage worker.  The charged relationship
between these two opposites, who have to pull together, turns out to be
easily the most interesting of several subplots.  Like the rest of the
movie, this relationship makes some twists you don't expect and avoids
others that you do.</P>
<P>Although the script doesn't have much of Mamet's signature dialog style,
in which two characters exchange fast-paced staccato repartee, it has
the overall structure he likes and has a host of fully developed
characters.  The heart-warming story is the type that Frank Capra would
have loved.</P>
<P>Slowly and delicately the movie lays out a series of questions for us?
Is the boy innocent, or might it not be as cut and dried as it seems?
Will the father ever arrange to get a trial, and, if so, what would be
the outcome?  And is the father's fanatical pursuit of justice even a
good idea?  The newspapers accuse him of wasting the government's time
and resources, and his once wealthy family is having trouble living in
the lifestyle to which they are accused.  His son, his wife points out,
is quite happy at his new school.  The beauty and intelligence of THE
WINSLOW BOY methodically lays out questions where lesser movies would
quickly provide easy answers.</P>
<P>THE WINSLOW BOY runs 1:50.  It is rated G and would be fine for kids old
enough to be interested in serious subjects.</P>
