<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An action-packed high-tech thriller, whose best virtues are that it
doesn't take itself seriously and there's plenty of action. If you
forget a little thing like the story doesn't make sense and the theater
you are in supplies you with bon-bons, then there's a chance you might
be lulled into accepting this flashy summertime film at face value and
be pleased by it.</P>
<P>The film has a snappy "Pulp Fiction" like start to it, as a puffy John
Travolta stares into the camera and his first words are: "You know what
the problem with Hollywood is - they make shit." He rants on by
deconstructing the bank robbery in Sidney Lumet's 1975 film "Dog Day
Afternoon," and goes on to relish what if the bank robbers succeeded!
When he gets up to leave, we realize that this cocky guy is heavily
armed and is in the middle of a bank heist, and he's negotiating with
the FBI agents over the tense hostage situation. The bank hostages have
bombs attached to them, and Travolta threatens mass executions if he's
not allowed to escape. When an FBI sharpshooter kills one of the bank
robbers, all hell breaks loose and the film flashes back to 4 days
earlier.</P>
<P>We first see one of the world's best hackers stopped as he tries to
enter L.A. from Finland. When he's questioned by FBI Agent Roberts (Don
Cheadle), he can't tell him whom he works for because he doesn't know.
But when the agent is called away on a phony call, the hacker is
executed by some assassins in a well-executed hit.</P>
<P>In Midland, Texas, ex-felon Stanley Jobson (Jackman), is out on parole
after serving 18 months for hacking into the FBI secret files and
destroying it with a virus. He's now reduced to poverty, living in an
unkempt trailer, and working as a gas station attendant. He's also not
allowed to see his beloved young daughter Holly, who now lives with her
porn-star mother and her new hubby, a porn-filmmaker in la-la land.</P>
<P>When sexy temptress Ginger (Halle Berry) shows up at his trailer and
offers him $100,000 to just meet her boss, all Stanley can say is that
he goes back to the slammer if he even touches a computer.</P>
<P>As soon as Stanley is talked into the deal, because he's promised $10
million and help to get his girl back, the big boss Gabriel (Travolta),
who's in an L.A. swinger's club, begins to work his menacing charms on
him. The film loses its wit and becomes a mindless thriller from here
on, as director Dominic Sena (Gone In Sixty Seconds), a parolee himself
from schlockmeister producer Jerry Bruckheimer, tries to push the
envelope in favor of evil doings and away from making a PG-13 film. He
succeeds in making an amoral film, where none of the characters are all
good or bad (or for that matter interesting). He leaves us with such an
awful feeling, pretty much like this filmmaker left us with in "Gone In
Sixty Seconds." This turns out to be another preposterous flick of his,
but with the trappings that it has something more to say about the evil
in the world than all the violence it pours onto the screen.</P>
<P>The convoluted plot involves Gabriel and his terrorist group, who are
secretly connected with a powerful and still more power-hungry senator
(Sam Shepard). They are planning to break into a secret slush fund the
government has for an aborted drug operation of theirs called
"Swordfish," where the drug money that has been taken from busted drug
lords is kept in impregnable safes. These guys claim to be
super-patriots, who are doing this heist to fund a private army and
their own nuclear arsenal to counter terrorism wherever it occurs with
their own brand of terrorism. They are doing it to make America the
safest and most feared country in the world. Their aim is to break into
the World Bank located in Los Angeles and steal $9.5 billion via an
electronic bank robbery. Stanley's job is to hack into a few encrypted
bank codes and move the money around.</P>
<P>The film has a lukewarm story going for it about an unwilling "common
man" type who is trapped into working for the bad guys, and is tailed by
the FBI because they want the man he's working for. Since he's really a
good guy who has done a few bad things in his life only because he
believes he was right in doing them, the filmmaker wants us to believe
his good instincts will prevail in the end. The film has lots of
expensive gadgets to work with, and they are used as explosives and as
gimmicks to fill in for the words that stop making sense after a while.
There are the usual betrayals and twists in such a story, the maddening
conclusion to the hostage situation, and a dubious ending that is
slickly done. The ending involves a police chase of a bus and a
helicopter lifting the bus airborne to another location, as everything
the film has going for it are invested in these action scenes.</P>
<P>The false morality of the film centers on the battle between Gabriel's
violent actions leading to a better world and Stanley's selfish desire
to be reunited with his little girl, as he could care less about the
world. While the FBI is scorned, because it is shown breaking the law to
get an arrest. With such a dark delineation of morals exhibited by all
sides, who cares who wins! This film is about exploding all the toys the
big-budget allowed for and keeping the action frenetic and the sex as
tawdry as possible. The acting was dreary. Hugh Jackman's performance
was particularly rancid. He was weepy and excitable but without showing
true feelings. He could access encrypted passwords faster than a
speeding bullet, even while having felatio performed on him by a whore.
John Travolta thinks he's Houdini, but he seems more like a guy getting
good money for playing a part that required little acting skills other
than to just look sinister and smile occasionally. Halle Berry is the
sexpot who when she isn't putting on a sexy pose, goes topless in one
scene and shows us that she has the body for it. The question about her
character revolves around whether she's Travolta's partner or a DEA
agent. Her acting problem is that she brought nothing to the screen but
a pair of nice tits (reportedly baring them for an extra million on her
regular contract).</P>
<P>This "Swordfish" has a smell to it, like it's not fresh. But if you're
looking for crass summertime entertainment, this dish of  "Swordfish"
can please those who have a very tolerant palate.</P>
