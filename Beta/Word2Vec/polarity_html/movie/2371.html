<PRE>                          SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1994 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Stockard Channing, Will Smith, Donald Sutherland.
Screenplay:  John Guare.
Director:  Fred Schepisi.</P>
<P>     There are few greater cinematic challenges than adapting a stage
play for the screen.  The two media are so different -- one primarily
of words, the other of images -- that some plays just don't lend
themselves to a film rendering.  For every AMADEUS, a play which was
opened up into a grand period drams, there is one A FEW GOOD MEN, too
talky and stagy to succeed fully.  That is the problem I fear many
viewers could have with SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION.  Thematically, John
Guare's play is quite rich, as it is in character.  However, its
rapid-fire dialogue and exaggerated acting will strike those unfamiliar
with live theater as too stylized and unrealistic.</P>
<P>     SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION unfolds primarily through flashbacks, as
wealthy Manhattan art dealer Flanders Kitteredge (Donald Sutherland)
and his wife Ouisa (Stockard Channing) describe a unique encounter to
friends.  One evening, a young man appears at their door, apparently
the victim of a mugging.  The fellow (Will Smith) claims to be Paul
Poitier, son of actor Sidney Poitier, as well as a friend of the
Kitteredge's children at Harvard.  He dazzles the Kitteredges for the
evening, but they soon discover there is more to Paul than the story he
has told.  They learn that he has had a similar encounter with a doctor
and another couple, each also beginning with an apparent mugging.
Gruadually, as they investigate the connection between their incidents,
Ouisa begins to wonder about connections in general, and to examine her
life.</P>
<P>     The characters at the heart of SIX DEGREES are marvelously
intricate, tying together an examination of the vagaries of fortune.
On one side is Flanders Kitteredge, a high roller whose gambles on art
deals leave him perpetually one step away from poverty, and
consequently obsessed with the trappings of wealth.  On the other side
is Paul, forced to the margins of society for the threefold sin of
being poor, black and gay, and wanting to do more than just look in
from the outside.  In the middle is Ouisa, who realizes the fragile
links between every human being.  "Every person on this planet is
connected to every other person by a chain of six people," she tells
her daughter, "six degrees of separation," and in her consciousness of
this chain she reaches out to Paul.  Where this theme could have come
off as a liberal social manifesto, SIX DEGREES treads lightly, making
the obsession of the Kitteredges and their cronies with finding the man
who had duped them comic but clear in its message: their world is
threatened if just *anyone* can appear to be one of them.</P>
<P>     The snag in SIX DEGREES is that even with its clever editing, even
with its location photography, it still feels far too much like a stage
play.  Don't misunderstand, I love live theater.  It is just that
acting styles and narrative choices which work when a performance is in
real time by actual size human beings one hundred feet away don't work
when those same human beings are twenty feet high.  Scenes involving
college-age children berating their wealthy parents come off as
ridiculously overacted, with staccato epithets overwhelming each
other.  Will Smith's genteel Paul Poitier persona seems too forced and
phony for anyone to accept, even the star-struck Kitteredges, and the
problem is that he's giving a big, broad performance much better suited
to the stage.  As a result, although I was intrigued with what SIX
DEGREES had to say, the staginess of the production didn't allow me to
get caught up in it.</P>
<P>     To be fair, not all of the performances have that quality.  Donald
Sutherland does an extremely sharp reading of Flanders, never
permitting him to appear stupid, which it would have been exceedingly
easy to do.  His sense of outrage grows as his facade crumbles, and he
conveys that tension with subtlety and style.  Stockard Channing, who
played Ouisa on Broadway for three years, clearly knows her character
inside out, and her telephone conversation with Paul late in the film
is fantastic work.  SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION provides some very funny
human comedy in an extremely well-constructed story.  It's also a story
which works much better on stage.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 degrees of separation:  6.</PRE>
