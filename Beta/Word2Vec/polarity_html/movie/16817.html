<PRE>THAT DAY, ON THE BEACH (1983)</PRE>
<P>"With all that education, you should know what happiness is."</P>
<PRE>1.5 out of ****</PRE>
<P>Starring Sylvia Chang, Teresa Hu, Hsu Ming, Li Lieh, Mao Hsueh-wei;
Directed by Edward Yang;
Written by Yang and Wu Nien-chen;
Cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Chang Hui-kung</P>
<P>Every country has, eventually, its New Wave.  France had its Nouvelle 
Vague, Brazil its Cinema Novo, China its Fifth Generation, and on and 
on.  Some waves just take longer than others, before they wash over 
us, cleansing us with the balm of discovery.  Taiwan's New Wave came 
in the 1980s, in the work of directors like Hou Hsiao-hsien, Wan Jen, 
and Edward Yang; THAT DAY, ON THE BEACH--Yang's first feature--is 
central.  It created a new language for young Taiwanese directors, 
even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and 
faltering.  Later works refined the techniques that Yang first 
explored here, giving Taiwan a distinctive international presence.  
THAT DAY itself is long and frustrating, the document of a nation's 
attempt to find a voice.</P>
<P>It does not lack ambition.  It anatomizes urban life in modern 
Taiwan, in the manner of Antonioni, elaborating the alienation that 
the Westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are 
shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men, loyal 
housewives--that they find unfulfilling.  Jia-li (Sylvia Chang) is the 
focus, but the film brings others into its compass--her husband, her 
brother, friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents.  
No one is happy.  Jia-li married her husband, We-lei, at a young age.  
At the time, her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage, 
despite his affection for another woman, and so Jia-li's marriage 
seemed, in comparison, a good one: she chose We-lei of her own free 
will, they loved each other.  But it goes wrong.</P>
<P>THAT DAY dutifully presents all the clichés: We-lei becomes absorbed 
in his career, indulges in an affair with a co-worker; Jia-li feels 
restless and trapped, bound by a choice she made while young, but 
which no longer seems wise.  The film never redeems these clichés by 
conveying the feel of authentic experience, the intensity of lived 
pain, and much of it seems trite and belaboured.</P>
<P>It unfolds, awkwardly, as a series of flashbacks, told during a 
luncheon in Vienna, where Jia-li meets her brother's old flame (Teresa 
Hu), now a concert pianist, whom she has not seen since college.  Both 
women seem rather sad, and resigned to their sadness.  Their 
circumstances (and those of Jia-li's brother and a college friend) 
suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the 
wrong man, chosen the wrong career path, etc.--but rather that the 
choices available to them were inadequate.  It is not that Jia-li 
married the wrong man; she didn't.  The problem is that she needed to 
marry at all--and that if she did not marry, she would still be just 
as unhappy.  For a woman in modern Taiwan, THAT DAY tells us, the 
cards are stacked, the dice are loaded: she can play the game, but the 
house always wins. </P>
<P>The film's sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the 
reason it caused such controversy upon its release in Taiwan.  Seen 
now, it does not seem provocative.  Indeed, it's hard to imagine 
anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any 
controversy: it may be ambitious, it may be innovative, but it is also 
terribly, terribly dull.  And what was new for Taiwan was not 
necessarily new for the rest of us: Yang adopts methods established 
years before by Antonioni and others, and his use of those methods is 
fumbling, uncertain, undisciplined.  Nor does he bring anything 
new--other than the locale--to the material.</P>
<P>There are moments when THAT DAY takes on some of the emotional 
richness it strives for--in a young couple's first kiss, in the 
awkward meeting of a woman and her husband's mistress--but they are 
brief.  Too often, Yang devotes needless time to mundane 
scenes--grocery shopping, flower-arranging--in which nothing happens, 
little is said, no emotion imparted.  Perhaps, if the film were 
content to focus on such reflective, inward moments, leaving us to 
guess at thoughts and feelings, it might have been ambiguous, 
suggestive, insinuating.  But Jia-li and her disaffected companions do 
not only brood in silence: they talk about their problems, at length, 
in detail, redundantly, and eliminate all subtleties.  At two hours 
and forty-five minutes, it all seems exorbitantly long, indulgently 
long-winded.</P>
<P>Consider the defining moment for Jia-li, the titular day on the 
beach.  The thrust of the whole film explains, easily enough, what we 
are to think of that moment, what it means when she walks away from a 
particular situation.  Even so, the film has not one but two 
characters explain it for us verbally, in case we may have missed the 
point.   Needless time is devoted to expressing what should have 
remained unexpressed, and that is the problem throughout.</P>
<P>The look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative.  It 
was the first feature shot by Christopher Doyle--at least, it's his 
name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world's 
leading cinematographers.  In the freewheeling expressionism of his 
work with directors like Chen Kaige and Wong Kar-wai, he seems 
incapable of fashioning a boring image.  You would never know it from 
watching THAT DAY, which, due either to Doyle's inexperience or Yang's 
humdrum direction, is almost perverse in its insistence on making the 
physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible.  In 
scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage, THAT DAY manages to capture 
the ennui of the experience, but none of the damage, none of the 
heartbreak.</P>
