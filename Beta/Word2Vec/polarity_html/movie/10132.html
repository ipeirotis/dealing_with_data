<P>I'm an avid fan of the "Alien" saga, so this review is obviously a tad
biased (at least I admitted it).  Of course, that doesn't mean that I'm
gonna be giving this a four-star review or something, because "Alien:
Resurrection," the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is NOT an
absolutely amazing film, much like the first two were.  However, it's a
very good film which never fails to entertain, and consists of yet
another mutation in the style of the series.  In short, I had a good
time.</P>
<P>"Alien: Resurrection" leaves off 200 years after the last one, where our
heroine protagonist, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the science
fiction genre's answer to Job, had killed herself after discovering that
an alien was inside her body, waiting to pop out like it did to John
Hurt in the first one.  Of course, the last one wasn't very great or
anything (I liked it, though not as much as the first two), and more
importantly, it wasn't financially successful (a tawdry 55 million
bucks!).  So back we are, with Ripley back as a clone, which means we
get another little satirical look at cloning (not that that's a bad
thing, but it's becoming a cliche).</P>
<P>So she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "The
Auriga" by some doctors (including the necessary bad government guy, Dr.
Wren, played by J.E. Freeman, as well as the little-seen Dr. Gediman,
played by none other than Brad Douriff), mainly because they have a
version of her with the alien still inside her.  Once you get past the
fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood (although I
think it might have been from the blood samples taken by Charles Dance
in the third one), the film's okay.</P>
<P>Also on board are a band of mercenary pirates, including Michael
Wincott, Ron Perlman, Kim Flowers, Raymond Cruz, Dominique Pinon (a
Jeunet sytable) and...Winona Ryder, who plays Analee Call, who turns out
to have a bit of a secret (I won't state it, but unless you've been
shacking up with Salinger for the past two years, you probably know all
about it - although it's nicely covered up).  There's a bit of a
non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and Ripley,
but it's never really deepened enough.  Oh well.</P>
<P>Well, as you might have guessed, the alien and its spawn escape and run
around the ship.  And it pretty much does away with most of the people
on the ship (including some shocks - Dan Hedaya, for instance, who's
death is comical yet sad since, well, he's Dan Hedaya), and the
remaining people (about 7 or 8) are left to try and escape and stop the
aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly
towards Earth.</P>
<P>Of course, the plot is all balderdash, and just an excuse for some good
old "Alien"-brand fun.  The real focus of the series seems to be on
style, not really substance (although there's always a bit of it, most
notably in "Aliens" with the relationship between Ripley and the little
girl).  What's interesting about the series is that each film is
stylistically different in its approach.  "Alien" is a claustrophobic
exercise in quiet frights.  "Aliens" is a wild, tense thriller.  "Alien
3" is a bleak, moody piece of semi-noir.  "Alien 4" is kind of like an
off-beat french film, filled with lots of humor, and cool scares.</P>
<P>Jean-Pierre Jeunet (without his usual directing partner, Marc Caro)
creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "Das Boot" has,
with echoes hinting at a possible threat.  The chills in the film are
really cool, especially with the music, which is sometimes turned down
completely for certain scenes (there's the most tense surgery scene
since "Face/Off" towards the beginning).  And not every chill turns into
a bloody mess or anything like that.  This all combined with some good
old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the
others.</P>
<P>There are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being
brilliantly executed.  One is the aforementioned surgery scene.  Another
one takes place between Call and Ripley, which is just awesome.  The
underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the
most tense, thrilling, and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga (with
a small allusion to Jeunet's earlier film, "Delicatessen").  And the way
they do in the final alien is hysterically cool (with a lovely allusion
to "Goldfinger").</P>
<P>But the best scene in the entire film (I'm sure I'm not the first to
mention it) takes place when Ripley sees all the variations on her as
they cloned her (she has a an "8" tatooed on her arm).  It might be the
most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga.</P>
<P>The screenplay by Joss Whedon is not a great piece of work, as it never
really deapens a lot of the characters.  However, it does make us care
about most of them, so that when there's very little of them, and it
looks like one or more of them may become Alien Chow, we are pretty
scared.  And, yeah, there are some very funny lines (Ripley: "Who do I
have to fuck to get off this boat?!" Johner: "Well, I can get you off. 
But not this ship.")</P>
<P>The acting is good all around, with stand-out performances from Ron
Perlman as the male chauvenist pig Johner, and Leland Orser (the poor
bastad in "Se7en" who performed the "lust" sin) as an anxiety-ridden
wannabe Woody Allen who has an alien inside him.  Winona Ryder is good,
but not amazing like she usually is (although she meshes well with the
film).  Of course, and as usual, Sigourney Weaver steals the show. 
Playing a variation on the Ripley character (less emotional, and more
rude and bitter), she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable. 
She's not going to get an Oscar nomination like she did for "Aliens,"
but she's just awesome.</P>
<P>Overall, it's a thrilling, entertaining film which doesn't really amaze
like the first two, but is much more amazing than the third
installment.  The style is the best part of the film, which isn't really
a bad thing, but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the
depth the film occasionally tries to apply.  But it's entertaining as
hell, and it's definitely fit for the "Alien" series.</P>
<PRE>MY RATING (out of 4): ***</PRE>
