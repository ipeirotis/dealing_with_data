<PRE>Cradle Will Rock Review</PRE>
<P>  Cradle Will Rock is the latest effort from director/actor Tim Robbins. While
he may have had an Oscar worthy film back in 1995 (Dead Man Walking), he gets a
little overconfident and sloppy here.
  The story is confusing, and filled with many subplots, so I'll try my best
and explain it as simply as possible. The film is based on a "mostly" true
story about a Federal theater in the 1930s, that produced a play (The Cradle
Will Rock) that apparently was offensive to some, so the government shuts it
down. It's during the time of the depression, and all this theater wants to do
is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs, or are poor. Between this
conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots, about those who work in theater, or
those associated. Also along the way are some other messages mashed together to
create an even more overwhelming experience. Tim Robbin's just keeps piling on
political views, and characters, that we just give up on the film, or in some
cases walk out. For Robbin's it may be a nice achievement, but to me it seemed
more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue,
and fancy outfits.
  I thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding
cast, unfortunately are all uninteresting, except for a few. Let me recap what
each important character does, so please bear with me (it's the least you can
do, especially if you were considering seeing this). I'll begin with those
involved with the play. There's Orson Welles (Angus Macfadyen) who of course is
the director of the play, the producer John Houseman (Cary Elwes), Marc
Blitzstein (Hank Azaria) the writer of the play, Emily Watson, a woman who gets
her break by playing the main part in Cradle Will Rock. Outside the play
there's the: ventriloquist (Bill Murray) who wants a relationship with a
Federal Theater clerk (Joan Cusack), another subplot involving a painter Diego
Rivera (Ruben Blades) who's unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by
Nelson Rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage (John Cusack). There's
a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories (Susan Sarandon,
Philip Baker Hall too name a few) but those that I mentioned, were the most
significant to the story. Anyway, most of these talented Hollywood stars were
completely wasted, except for Emily Watson, who does another great job, and one
of my personal favorite actors John Cusack, who always delivers through thick
and thin.
  Now although most of the film was weak to say the least, there were some nice
moments and some involving subjects, but all this is overblown. Sure the free
speech segment was a nice feature, but not when it becomes repetitive. The
whole film is like this, and it's basically nothing but a headache.
  On the brighter side, Tim Robbin's direction was masterful. His camera
direction seemed reminiscent to the works of Paul Thomas Anderson's latest
Magnolia, only smoother In my opinion, but even that can't make a movie that
much better.
  Although it has it's moments (not many of them, but they're there), Cradle
Will Rock stays true to it's title, because the cradle rocked too far and
tipped over.</P>
