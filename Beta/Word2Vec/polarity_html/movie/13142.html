<P>By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (<A HREF="mailto:nate@pyramid.net">nate@pyramid.net</A>)</P>
<P>        Perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits.  I
really do like to read, and I've enjoyed many books in my lifetime.  My
problem is that I'm a slow reader, and not very dedicated -- I'll enjoy
portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time (it's taken
me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of Anna
Karenina, even though I'm loving the book).  In addition to this, I
typically don't read anything created after the 19th century.  The only
reason I bother with this bit of information is because I feel bad
admitting, time after time, that I haven't read any of the books on
which these films are based (the only exception, I believe, is Great
Expectations).  </P>
<P>        However, I don't think it should be necessary to read the book
beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film.  Needless to say,
I haven't read the Elmore Leonard novel Out of Sight, on which Steven
Soderbergh's new film is based.  I can't say how faithful of an
adaptation it is, or if it lives up to Leonard's vision.  I can say that
it's a terrific film, with sharp acting, great dialogue, and pumping
full of energy and style injected by Soderbergh.  It's certainly a nice
distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters, all hopelessly
wishing that size mattered.  Out of Sight proves that it doesn't.</P>
<P>        I had originally written George Clooney off as a one-note actor,
incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair.  After
seeing his latest performance in this film, I've changed my mind -- this
guy can act, but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly
will make him one of those $20 million superstars.  Here, he plays Jack
Foley, a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living.  He does it
because it's fun, I think, but the film opens with him getting caught
because his car won't start.</P>
<P>        He goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five
cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend, Buddy (Ving
Rhames).  We're then introduced to Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez), a U.S.
Marshall who, conveniently, is waiting with a shotgun as Jack escapes. 
Fortunately, they take her hostage, and she and Jack spend some quality
time in the trunk together as Buddy drives them to safety.  The central
conflict arises when both Jack and Karen become obsessed with one
another, though their respective jobs make them superficially
incompatible.</P>
<P>        We soon learn that the film is not told in sequence (and, since this is
a gritty crime comedy, flashbacks of Pulp Fiction should arise).  At
first, I kind of felt that it was a gimmick, but I guess it was a
gimmick in Pulp Fiction, too.  It's a fun gimmick, though, and
Soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes
off naturally.  I've only seen a few of Soderbergh's films (I was
impressed both with Kafka and sex, lies, and videotape), but I think
he's excellent at what he does.  He's an artist without making it
obvious, and without being pretentious, which is always admirable.  He
uses tricks, yes (lots of freeze-frame stuff here), but it all adds to
the smooth and quirky currents in the film.</P>
<P>        As I said, Clooney is terrific, and he's matched by Lopez.  Lopez is,
of course, beautiful, but she can act, too.  I can sense that she's
honing in on her skills, for she comes off more natural here than she
has in any of her previous ventures (not that Stone gave her much help
in the loathsome U-Turn).  The two actors have arresting chemistry with
one another -- the best scene in the film, by far, is the seduction
scene.  The brilliance of this scene is also due, in part, to
Soderbergh, for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a
bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later.  The
scene is a series of soft nuances and glances, layered upon light
dialogue, and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent
cinema -- meaningful and engrossing.</P>
<P>        The supporting cast is strong, led by the always-reliable Ving Rhames. 
Dennis Farina, who plays Karen's father, is good, as is Don Cheadle as
the profoundly stupid villain.  Steve Zahn, who plays Jack's
nearly-brain dead accomplice Glenn, steals all of his scenes (and that's
in a film where every scene is already at a high level).  All of the
actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed
script by Scott Frank.</P>
<P>        Out of Sight is certainly a light film, although there are a few heavy
moments that will linger in the memory.  Overall, I can recommend it
simply as great entertainment.  Not every film has to change your life,
and it's nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and
simply to entertain its viewers.  As for the book, this film is good
enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text
worth looking at.</P>
