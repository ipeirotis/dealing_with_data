<P>It is 1935, the group called The Comedian Harmonists are at the height
of their popularity, they are world famous, as we see them formally
dressed in tails performing on stage one of their favorite harmonies,
"Veronika."</P>
<P>The film flashes back to Berlin in 1927, the weak Weimar Republic is in
power and will remain so until 1933, when Hitler's Third Reich took over
and put its anti-Semitic policies to work.This will provide the backdrop
for this true story, that is most probably not told in its full
accuracy, as it tells about the rise and fall of the musical group and
their personal lives, and the events in Nazi Germany that made it
impossible for them to exist as they once were, since half of their six
members were Jewish, and Jews were no longer allowed to perform in
Germany under the Nazis.</P>
<P>Harry Frommermann (Ulrich) is the unemployed Jewish actor (and
dead-ringer for Robert Benigni) and self-taught musician and baritone,
who tells his agent that he is a musician not an actor.That his ability
is in arranging music, is met with cynicism by his agent, who tells him
that there are 3 million unemployed Germans on the street who are
arrangers.</P>
<P>Harry runs an ad in the paper, after hearing a record of an American
Negro group called "The Revellers" singing harmony; and, he is also
influenced by the music of the Duke Ellington. He now thinks that he
could put together such music for a German capella group, consisting of
five singers in harmony with a piano accompanist. The first one that he
hires for the group is the very Aryan looking, Robert Biberti (Ben
Becker), the son of an opera singer, with an untrained but beautiful
voice, who then gets the rest of the group together from among his
acquaintances: Roman Cycowski (Heino Ferch), born in Poland, who wants
to perform at the grand opera and will become a cantor in America when
the group is disbanded in the late 30s; Erich Abraham Collin (Heinrich
Schafmeister), has just passed his exam at the conservatory; Ari
Leschnikoff (Max Tidof), a gifted Bulgarian tenor, who is working as a
singing waiter; and, Erwin Bootz (Kai Wiesinger), a barroom pianist,
completes the group, as the non-singing member.Then came long hours of
practice without being paid, as they worked on getting their syncopated
sound together and their full routine of double-entendres, such as their
"asparagus are sprouting" number. Some of the other songs they sing, all
seem to be lighthearted, such as, "Beautiful Isabella From Castile" and
"When Yuba Plays the Rumba on the Tuba."</P>
<P>Their big break comes as they audition for a revue show and get the job,
as Bob, puffs on his big cigar and boldly works out the financial
arrangements for the group. Then recordings follow and sold-out concert
appearances and tours throughout Europe.</P>
<P>The love clash between Harry and Bob is over a music student and
part-time employee at a music store owned by an elderly patriotic Jewish
couple, the very attractive Erna Eggstein (Meret Becker), who,
incidentally, is the real sister of Ben Becker. The romance between
Harry and Erna starts first, as Harry shyly pursues her, encouraged by
her only too willing consent. Harry must first go to the grave site of
his parents and tell them that he has fallen in love with a non-Jewish
woman. When Bob meets her, he also falls for her, having led a wild
bachelor's life, he knows instinctively that this is the one for
him.When he takes her to a boxing match, he finds that Erna is
dissatisfied that Harry doesn't pay her enough attention and does not
take her studies seriously, so when Bob asks her to move in with him,
she does, even though, she still loves Harry.</P>
<P>This is a time of great change and upheaval in Berlin, and there is an
international flavor in the air, as culture is moving in that direction.
Therefore there are great changes in the way people relate to others.
Bootz will live with a Polish Jewish girl, but dump her when the Nazis
are starting to flex their muscle in the mid-thirties. Roman's Aryan
fiancée will convert to Judaism. Collin, the third Jew of the group,
will marry a French prostitute working the red light district of Berlin.</P>
<P>As far as the Nazis, their hatred is very apparent and very gripping
across all levels of society during this time.This film takes, in my
opinion, an erroneous view of their activity, soft peddling it, and
stating that it was only among the lower classes that anti-Semitism was
prevalent, that the upper classes and the cultured classes were
generally supportive of the Jews.This is just not true. It is a
rewriting of history that is not based on the facts. Daniel Goldhagen's
book, "Hitler's Willing Executioners," makes it clear, leaving no doubt,
that anti-Semitism was rampant among all classes.The majority of Germans
were anti-Semites, and there is no getting away from that. And just
because the group continued to have sold-out concerts after it became
known that there were Jews in the group and that the notorious Nazi
Julius Streicher, publisher of Stürmer (a major Nazi newspaper), was
able to grant them special permission to continue performing during this
difficult time, because he admired them and asked for their autographs,
would not indicate that things weren't so bad. That is just ignoring the
truly horrible and pervasive Nazi reign of terror, that really didn't go
into full blast until Kristallnacht in '38, but was certainly more
wide-spread in the early 30s than what was portrayed here. It should
also be noted that Streicher was executed as a Nazi war criminal as a
result of the Nuremberg trials.</P>
<P>There is one scene that shows some of this Nazi S.A. brownshirt hatred
in action, as we see how it is directed against the Jewish music store
owners who can't understand what is happening to their country and why
they are being singled out and why their store is being smeared with
anti-Semitic messages, asserting that their son died fighting for
Germany in the last war. The Holocaust came a few years later, but there
is no doubt that the initial plans for the "Final Solution" was
underway, even back then; and, even if, there were a few Germans who
were not filled with hatred, like Erna, it cannot be denied, they were
still badly outnumbered.</P>
<P>The scene when the group comes to perform in New York on board the USS
Saratoga, gets everything it can about that scene wrong. For one thing,
the Navy was not integrated then, so all those black faces on board were
not on board during the 30s. And, New York never looked so unreal and
artificial. The real problem the group has in New York, is whether they
should return home, as a conflict develops over this matter between Bob
(who doesn't want to leave his elderly mother alone) and Harry, who sees
the handwriting on the wall in Germany, and feels he has nothing left
there. But it is settled when the rest of the group decides to return to
a changing Germany, that is, despite realizing that their country is
being purged of its international and Communistic and bourgeois
influences, in favor of nationalism, by the intolerant Nazis, who have
taken complete control of the arts.</P>
<P>Their final concert is a standing-ovation triumph to their popularity,
as they are forced by Nazi laws to not mingle with the Jews and
therefore must disband the group.There is a crush of people surging
onstage to give them warm support and encouragement. As a result, two
groups are formed, the Jews leave Germany and play in exile (actually
having great success in Australia) and the gentiles stay in Germany;
but, they cannot make it separately, and because of the war the
internationalism of their music loses favor, as both groups disband by
1941.</P>
<P>In an epilogue, it is mentioned how all the members survived WW11: As
all the Jewish members went to America, as did Erna, who married Harry,
and, later on, divorced him in the early 1950s.</P>
<P>There was something emotionally flat and unconvincing about this story,
that not only rubbed me the wrong way, but made me think how apologetic
the filmmaker was to the real events of history, as he tried to force
feed the audience into believing so many untruths about what actually
took place, that it is hard for me to say that this film made up for its
distorted history lessons with its pleasing music and cabaret-like mood
its splendid cinematography presented. Its call for the world to be less
nationalistic and more global minded, had a pleasing ring to it, but
that is simply not enough to counter how tame the film appears as a
whole, as the story does not dig deep enough into the real events; and,
also, the characters are only superficially dealt with, despite the
terrific performances, so that the love story and all the different
personality clashes seem to be glossed over, not making me feel involved
with them as much as I should be. Leaving me with the impression that I
was seeing a good looking and sounding film, but one that did not
ultimately satisfy my need to feel that Germany has learned its lesson
from its most pernicious period of history, as it fails to answer the
question, how can such a cultured people accept the atrocities of the
Nazis so willingly.</P>
