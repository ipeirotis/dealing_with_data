<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An above-par courtroom drama, set in Los Angeles, elevated by
director/screenwriter Clifford Odets' sharp script. He originally
intended for this work to be a play. It was also elevated by an
outstanding cast, with special kudos to Rita Hayworth's warm portrayal
of a woman in an abusive marriage and by Sanford Meisner's forceful and
expressive performance as the cross-examing prosecutor.</P>
<P>The bulk of the film takes place in the courtroom and since we
immediately see the crime, we know that it was an accident and therefore
the tension in the film comes about in finding out if the two lovebirds
accused of murdering her husband will be given a death sentence, because
the circumstances point to their guilt.</P>
<P>The opening shot is of the newspaper headline: "Mrs. Jo Morris (Rita)
and Larry Ellis (Gig) held for murder." Jo's mother (Squire) is strapped
for cash, but she visits the lawyer son of a mother who was under her
nurse's care before she died. Victor Santini (Franciosa) is an angry
young man, with a drinking problem, and acts surly toward Mrs. Brown,
refusing to take the case because he's a small-time lawyer who will have
to go against the D.A., who has an unlimited amount of money to spend to
get his conviction. He is also dismayed that Mrs. Brown can't afford to
pay the fair amount it would take to have her daughter be ably
represented. But when Mrs. Brown cries and lets him know how highly his
mother spoke of him and how smart he is, working his way through Harvard
Law School, the hardened lawyer changes his mind.</P>
<P>As Santini investigates what happened, he becomes convinced the couple
is telling the truth. That Larry was her accountant, a widower who is
burdened with an overbearing and self-righteous mother (Dunnock) who
tries to lead his life for him, and that the love had long-gone-out of
Jo's marriage to her brutal and alcoholic husband (Ryder), whereby she
has become indifferent to him. The two lovers were drawn together by
their mutual problems and had been intimate only once.</P>
<P>Just before Larry went to do his friend Morrie's (Penn) account in
Sacramento, he  learned from his mother that she had a private detective
follow the couple and is now meddling in the hopes that he give up this
married woman whom he dearly loves. Mrs. Ellis also visited Jo and
warned her that if she doesn't stay away from her son, she will tell her
policeman husband. Worried about his mother's interference and wishing
to throw the private detective off his trail, he uses Sacramento as an
alibi to shake his mother's private detectives, as he rushes back at
night and comes to Jo's house to secretly comfort her about what his
mother did. Jo's husband hears them in the kitchen and still drunk from
the wedding they just came back from, gets his gun and gets into a
tussle with Larry. He gets killed as the gun accidently goes off when
they were tussling.</P>
<P>The beauty in the film is in the long-drawn-out courtroom dramatics.
Santini emotionally got to the bottom of the case, whereas Judge Carey,
was basically ineffectual as Larry's lawyer, more interested in doing
what the domineering Mrs. Ellis wants him to do then getting her son
free of the murder charge. Santini had to virtually defend both of the
lovers, whereas the dynamic prosecutor, Mr. Stanley (Meisner), spun a
scenario of the lovers in cahoots to knock off the husband and get the
insurance money. He uses Larry's bogus Sacramento alibi and her lie of a
prowler around the house when she reported the murder, as proof that
they can't be trusted to tell the truth.</P>
<P>The story itself wasn't too interesting, but the performances were
energetic and the film had a good courtroom style, enough to make this
chatty film well worth seeing.</P>
