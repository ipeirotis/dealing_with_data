<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Waking the Dead is based on a novel by Scott Spencer, the screenplay is
by Robert Dillon, and it is directed by actor-turned-filmmaker Keith
Gordon ("Chocolate Wars"). It's a metaphysical love story with a bit of
mystery thrown in. There's also more than a bit of a political allegory
to it that holds the film together in an intelligent way, as both of the
main characters are motivated by political concerns. One as the
idealistic rebel who is an outsider, the other as an insider who wants
to change the system from within. The film is set during the 1970s and
early 1980s.</P>
<P>The love story is complex and is the heart of this engrossing film, a
film that deals with the ambiguities that propel people to be who they
are. It's especially pleasing because Jennifer Connelly plays a Catholic
activist named Sarah Williams in such a touching way that her innate
beauty shines forth as an angelic figure who happens to fall for her
opposite, an ambitious politician. It's a relationship filled with all
sorts of possible pitfalls. Billy Crudup plays the wheedling Fielding
Pierce who's stuck in an empty world of deceit, in a political role much
like the Robert Redford character in the Candidate. Both candidates
think they can make a difference to help their constituents by going
after power positions in the government, even though that can't help
noticing how corrupt the system they are willing to serve really is;
but, they are still willing to compromise themselves to serve. In
Fielding's case he never shows that he's even a liberal, only that he's
blinded by an urge to achieve success. The calculating working-class
hero has gone to Harvard to be a lawyer, joined the Coast Guard to get
out of Vietnam duty and because it'll look good on his resume.
Eventually Fielding ends up as a congressional candidate for the
Democrat machine and questions his sanity after seeing the love of his
life, whom he presumed to be dead, suddenly emerge. He will never be
quite sure if what he envisioned was real or a figment of his desires,
but his sanity at this point is certainly questionable.</P>
<P>The film opens in 1972 as the young Coast Guard officer goes up to the
NYC office of his brother Danny (Paul Hipp), who is a hippie book
publisher. Here he is attracted to his brother's new assistant Sarah and
they both fall in love; even though, they are miles apart politically.
She states: "I want a life that makes sense." He says: "I want to be
president." The film wavers back and forth between the following years
1972, 1974, 1982, and1983.</P>
<P>In 1974 the couple live together in Chicago and he attends law school
while she works as a church activist, even travelling to Chile for the
cause of freedom. The following tragedy that occurs will haunt Fielding
in the ensuing years: Sarah is reported dead in a car bomb explosion in
Minneapolis while transporting two leftists Chilean refugees.</P>
<P>In 1974 Fielding has been befriended by Chicago power broker for the
Democratic machine, Isaac Green (Hal Holbrook), who hooks the Bobby
Kennedy lookalike Fielding up in the district attorney's office. Then in
1982 when Fielding is 32 and a bachelor, and going out with the niece of
Isaac's, Juliet (Molly Parker), he's offered a chance by the governor to
run for congress in a special election. But after getting the nomination
Fielding starts to come psychologically apart, imagining that he sees
the real Sarah or her ghost following him around wherever he goes. It
culminates with Fielding winning the close special election in 1983 and
going to Washington, where his mind is made up to do good for his
constituents.</P>
<P>I don't really know how great this film is, but it did catch my
attention; especially, the way Gordon was able to get his main
characters to act out who they were and struggle to make their life and
their love viable, despite the different directions they would have to
go to get where they wanted to be. There was something soap opera like
about this tragic love affair that was not only baffling but sad, yet it
was more dramatic than that. We weren't overwhelmed by them as
stereotypes, forced into accepting them. I think how we accepted them
really relates to our life experiences. I know I felt very comfortable
with Jennifer Connelly's performance; I thought it was subtle,
soft-spoken, and unforgettably powerful. It was easy for me to relate to
her and what she was about without feeling I was presented with a
character who was being foisted on me in a "Love Story" tear-jerker way.
The film was passionate, intelligent, and real. The best scene is on a
subway between Fielding and Sarah -- a single 3 1/2-minute shot -- where
they are having a heart to heart talk that seemed so unbelievably real.
The Jennifer Connelly character is really the subject of the film and
her spirit fills the screen whether she's on it or not. This is because
she came across as someone with a real heart and is always haunting us
throughout the film because we care about her. We don't really care
about him. The two actors were just terrific, giving the story its
potency and purpose.</P>
