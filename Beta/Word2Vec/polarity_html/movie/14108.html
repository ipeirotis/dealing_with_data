_54_ (R) * 1/2 (out of ****)</PRE>
<P>If there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film, it was
Studio 54, the late Steve Rubell's infamous New York discotheque, which
came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday:
easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone, all set to a thumping
dance beat.  So when Miramax started production on _54_ last year, the buzz
of hype and resulting anticipation began: an edgy film as down-and-dirty as
the club itself, written and directed by a promising first-timer (Mark
Christopher) and starring some hot young talent (Salma Hayek, Neve
Campbell, newcomer Ryan Phillippe, and Mike Myers in his dramatic debut).</P>
<P>My, how easily does the worm turn.  Hype turned into damage control when
word got out about 11th-hour reshoots (wrapped only a month ago), a rash of
studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew
(especially Christopher) unhappy, and the very likely possibility that
Miramax would not screen the finished film for critics.  At the last
minute, though, Miramax did decide to screen the film (so hastily scheduled
was the screening that Myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation,
not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes) for a media audience
that came away noticeably less than impressed, myself included.  And with
good reason--somehow, some way, the supremely disappointing _54_ has made
the historically hip haven of hedonism... boring.</P>
<P>Although Christopher has distanced himself from the finished film, he
still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness.  _54_
focuses, for the most part, on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club:
coat check girl/aspiring disco diva Anita (a wasted Hayek); her busboy
husband, Greg (Breckin Meyer); and, most prominently, the fresh-from-Jersey
Shane O'Shea (Phillippe), who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head
bartender.  These characters are about as generic as those descriptions.
In focusing on the hired help, Christopher really missed the boat.  With
the exception of the flamboyant, always-woozy Rubell (Myers, in a
well-modulated turn), the meaty stories to be told at Studio 54 are not the
workers' but those of the people who went there to party; not necessarily
the numerous VIP guests, but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked
from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance (among
other things) the night away with the rich, famous, and infamous (the only
taste of the crowd comes by way of Ellen Dow's feisty Dottie, a disco- and
drug-crazed granny, but she's a peripheral character at best).  As such,
aside from the expected overhead crowd shots, there is precious little
actual _dancing_ in _54_.  What is a disco film--especially one about the
pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing?  Even Whit Stillman's
_The_Last_Days_of_Disco_, which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it
was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping
preppies, featured at least one extended dance scene.</P>
<P>Dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex, but that
may not be entirely Christopher's fault.  From what I've heard, his
original vision was something considerably more dark and daring, starting
with the Shane character: he was conceived (and actually filmed) as a wild,
morally ambiguous bisexual, which would have made an efficient springboard
to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of Studio 54's legend.  But
somewhere between principal photography and the final cut, Shane was
defanged and quite literally straightened out; consequently, so was the
film.  Aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning
of the film, Shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite Billie
(Sela Ward), and an abbreviated bedhopping montage, the sexual dimension is
just about ignored.  Shane, in this incarnation, is sanitized to the point
of blandness, an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the
club, Julie Black (Campbell), a worldly soap star with, yes, a heart of
gold.  This tacked-on "romance" would have been slightly less tedious if
either Campbell or Phillippe made some connection with each other or the
audience.  They fail on both counts.</P>
<P>Ultimately, _54_'s failure comes down to three letters: F-U-N.  As in,
there isn't any to be had for the audience.  Too much time is spent with
the boring Shane, and too little is spent on the club floor, where all the
action took place.  Anyhow, though, whatever time is spent on the 54 floor
is not used very effectively.  When Anita finally gets her big break and
perform onstage at the club, it should be a euphoric height, for her, the
crowd, and the audience; however, the moment doesn't get a chance to reach
that level, for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality, which
also mars the film's conclusion (one of the last-minute reshoots).
Strangely upbeat and wistful, the resolution is wholly unconvincing and
unsatisfying.</P>
<P>There is an interesting portrait of Studio 54 out there--two of them, in
fact--but _54_ is not one of them.  They're on cable TV: a couple of
documentaries produced by E! and VH1.  These two fascinating looks at the
club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great
disco movie to be made.  The problem is, after the critical and certain box
office failure of _54_, the subject may have run its Hollywood course.</P>
