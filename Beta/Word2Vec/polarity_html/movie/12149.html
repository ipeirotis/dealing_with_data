<P>     I suppose HIGH ART is as good a name as any for this pretentious 
melodrama, an often-diverting but ultimately pointless attempt to wed 
intellectual twaddle with a soap-opera-ish lesbian romance.  Lisa 
Cholodenko's film, which had its world premiere in competition at the 
1998 Sundance Film Festival, received a decidedly mixed reception there, 
but was widely praised by feminists more because of its theme of female 
empowerment than because of a particularly original or engaging script.</P>
<P>     HIGH ART introduces us to Syd (Radha Mitchell), a hard-working 
twenty-something woman who has a menial position at a high-end 
photography magazine and whose home life includes a lifeless, routine 
relationship with an unsupportive cad named James.  One day, a leak in 
the ceiling of Syd's apartment opens a whole new world to her.  When she 
goes upstairs to inquire about the problem, she stumbles into the 
bohemian world of Lucy Berliner (Ally Sheedy), a once-famous fashion 
photographer who vanished from the public eye a decade ago.  Lucy's 
apartment is awash in sex, drugs, and banal, intellectual chatter.  She 
lives with her heroin-addicted lover, a German ex-actress named Greta 
(Patricia Clarkson), and a bunch of friends who drift in and out as they 
please.  Syd is so intrigued by Lucy's lifestyle that she worms her way 
into the older woman's inner circle, then uses the opportunity to press 
Lucy into doing a photo spread for her magazine.  Soon, however, the 
pair's working relationship turns sexual, and neither is sure where they 
should go from there.</P>
<P>     The most honest (although not the most unique) aspect of HIGH ART 
is the relationship between Syd and Lucy.  These are both real 
characters beset by believable angst.  The attraction is palpable and 
both actresses give capable performances.  Radha Mitchell (LOVE AND 
OTHER CATASTROPHES) lights up the screen with an unforced combination of 
innocence and seemingly-unintentional sensuality.  Ally Sheedy, who is 
best known for undemanding roles (such as in THE BREAKFAST CLUB and ONLY 
THE LONELY), is surprisingly effective cast against type (although I 
think some of the praise heaped upon her for this role has been 
overstated – she's good, but not excellent).  Frankly, though, I wish 
the movie had spent a little more time concentrating on Syd alone and 
less on her sexual liaison with Lucy.  Although better developed than 
most motion picture lesbian affairs, it's fundamentally not all that 
compelling.</P>
<P>     Unfortunately, the romance between Syd and Lucy is just one of a 
number of things on Cholodenko's agenda.  Her script delves into themes 
of female empowerment, the war between ambition and affection, the 
effects of star power, and the balance between art and commercialism.  
None of these ideas (many of which are glossed over) are effectively 
presented.  They are either woven into the plot in an obvious, chunky 
fashion (all that's missing is a neon sign saying "Look!  Important 
issue ahead!") or introduced through the pretentious drivel that the 
characters spout at one another.  </P>
<P>     Aside from Syd and Lucy, the characters are either irritating or 
complete non-entities.  All men fall into the latter category.  The only 
male with any significant screen time, a slacker played by actor Bill 
Sage (who has appeared in a number of Hal Harley films), spends most of 
his time sitting around in Lucy's apartment, engaging in pointless 
conversation and getting stoned.  Syd's partner, James, is a one-
dimensional, egocentric jerk.  On the female side, the most prominent 
supporting character is Lucy's irritating, self-absorbed lover, who is 
played with over-the-top relish by Patricia Clarkson.  </P>
<P>     Visually, HIGH ART is impressive.  The film's appearance is, as the 
title implies, artistic, and Cholodenko's presentation of the 
female/female sex scene is lush and sensual.  The director also displays 
an aptitude for developing atmosphere (consider, for example, the exotic 
setting of Lucy's apartment).  However, while such a sumptuous style 
makes it more enjoyable to look at the picture, it's far from everything 
needed for a successful endeavor.  Despite solid performances in the two 
major roles, HIGH ART's script is too talky and uneven to make this 
really worthwhile, unless, of course, you're a fan of arty soap operas.</P>
