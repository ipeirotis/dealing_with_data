<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>An amusingly exploitive "B" movie by writer-director Matthew Bright
(Guncrazy screenwriter) about a white trash family and their abused
teenage daughter, Vanessa Lutz (Reese Witherspoon), who goes on the run
rather than go back to a foster-care shelter when her mother and
stepfather are arrested.</P>
<P>"Freeway" plays with the "Little Red Riding Hood" fairy tale motif to
make it fit into modern-day California and its plethora of dysfunctional
families. Little Red Riding Hood is none other than the resourceful
Reese who is up against a serial killer wolf (Keifer Sutherland as Bob
Wolverton), while going to see a grandma she has never met and doesn't
know that she is coming to see her, who lives north of Reese in
Stockton. Grandma represents an ideal for the troubled girl, who has a
long juvenile arrest record and faces a bleak present, never mind her
bleak future.</P>
<P>The film opens as Vanessa is in her special education class and
pathetically can't read the sentence on the board "The cat drinks
milk."She kisses her black boyfriend Chopper (Bokeem) after class and
when she arrives home the police come into her parents' motel room and
inform her that her mother (Amanda Plummer) has been arrested for
prostitution and possession of drugs. Soon her stepfather (Michael T.
Weiss) is arrested for parole violation because of the drugs in the
apartment. Rather than go back to the children's shelter, she cuffs the
welfare care worker, assigned to her case, by the ankles to the bed,
steals her car, says goodbye to Chopper and gets a gun from him as a
parting gift, and heads for the freeway and grandma's house.</P>
<P>On the freeway her car breaks down. Bob stops to help her and by not
showing her his sharp teeth, he seems to come off as being a nice man.
He tells her the car she's in has had it, and offers her a ride to Los
Angeles, while telling her that he is a counselor for emotionally
disturbed boys and willingly listens to her tale of woe. She likes him
and even tells him that she trusts him completely, telling him her whole
life story. Evidently, no one has ever listened to her before and she
feels good until Bob starts wanting to know about the explicit sex she
had with her stepfather, and she smells a wolf. Bob turns out to be a
serial killer, who has been in the local news, wanted for killing a
number of prostitutes on the freeway, where he is known as the I-5
killer. After he pulls a razor blade on her and cuts her ponytail and
calls her the kind of slut that he must kill, she pulls a gun on him and
when he tells her to let him go but take his money, that no one would
believe her word over his, she gives him one more chance to redeem
himself. But, he refuses to take Jesus as his Lord and personal Savior,
as she requests, so she sprays him with bullets.</P>
<P>She is arrested for attempted murder when she enters the diner all
covered in blood and the diner staff call the police. The disfigured Bob
makes it barely alive to the hospital and fingers her as the culprit,
when the police question him. He becomes the source of parody, as the
doctors piece him back together, whereby he can't talk clearly, looks
grotesque, and has holes in his throat so that when he smokes, the smoke
can be seen coming out of his throat.</P>
<P>She tells the two detectives who question her exactly what happened.
But, of course, they do not believe her. When she calls Chopper, she
finds out that he had been shot by drug dealers. So, she enters a
juvenile detention facility, accepting what happened to her without any
noticeable signs of depression, even laughing at the victim during her
absurd trial. A trial that makes chop-suey of how the establishment
conducts their business, where usually the best story heard in a case
wins the decision. She didn't come up with the best story -- that takes
money and a smart but sleazy lawyer to handle the case.</P>
<P>The prison scenes were over-the-top, trashy, and fun to watch, as the
director did not care a damn about drama or plot. The film shoots for
tongue-in-cheek humor in the interactions between characters and also it
aims to cast some black humor on the social hypocrisies of the welfare,
judicial, and penal systems. As satire, this film is tops. It was
excessive, but it had enough bite in it to do some damage. Reese
Witherspoon's performance was contagious, watching her cut-up,
act-tough, be vulnerable, and drop comic lines with a natural ease, and
all the time, the film had the feel of being noir, even though it was
really satire. It had enough toughness in it to be viewed as a thought
provoking film, when the action cleared and the cartoonish-type of
laughs emanating from the veggie-like characters died down.</P>
<P>The film had a lot of little things going for it, that added up to big
plusses. The film's opening credits had the Grimm fairy tale story of
Little Red Riding Hood depicted in its cartoon drawings. The Brooke
Shield's role of the righteously indignant wife of the killer, was a
satisfying part for "The Blue Lagoon" girl, as she shows how she has
matured as an actress. It should also be noted, that the detective
partners, one white (Dan Hedaya) and the other black (Wolfgang Bodison),
show how prejudicial they can be when investigating a crime. It is not
until after the black officer finds that Reese is a coal-burner (one who
goes out with blacks), that he goes out to the scene of the crime and
investigates the case the way he is supposed to.</P>
<P>Freeway has the look of a crazed fable, as bulky onscreen figures are
made to look less imposing at each impending scene and the vulnerable
ones either die or get stronger just by surviving amidst such violent
chaos.The film draws to its inevitable conclusion- of blood and gore,
despair and muted hope, and the irrelevancy of the 1990s in trendy
California, which can be seen as a failed center-piece for social
change. The film's sordid family scenario, leaves its sensationalized
news stories mockingly imprinted on the airwaves, depicting how sad life
is and how cartoon-like are the players, left to their own vanities,
frolicking in an artificial landscape of alienation and violent
gestures. This is the imperfect teenager fairy tale for the 1990s, for
those living out their pop culture dream without weighing what that
culture means, and where for the young bored-with-life students, reading
and writing cannot replace loud music and drugs.</P>
