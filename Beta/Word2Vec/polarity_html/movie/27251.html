<P>A cute family drama/comedy about destiny and the choices one makes. This
indie film is set in Chicago, comparing the protagonist's working-class
background in the produce market with the high culture of the opera
world he rejected. George Krikkos (Tom Bastounes) is being divorced by
his wife Jill (Burns), as the final straw comes when she catches him
sneaking home late at night after a tryst. She will be getting married
again shortly and taking with her their young son (Coren Caldwell). In
this one week period of George's life, there will be other traumatic
changes, his father will be retiring after selling the produce business
he works at, with George staying on with his brother Dean to work for
the new bosses. But...the biggest surprise is when his former girlfriend
and classmate of 20 years ago, arrives in Chicago to perform. She is now
an internationally famous diva in the opera, known as Gina Spenza
(Monica Zaffarano).</P>
<P>George seems in a rut...not enthusiastic about his work or his
prospects, going out with a girlfriend (Moore) who borders on being a
psycho, and wondering what if he didn't give up a potential singing
career for the produce business -- where would he now be! He gets a
chance to relive the past, as he meets Gina and they rekindle their
romance. She is currently seeing a silver-haired senator (White) from
New Hampshire and is on a 5-day whirlwind tour of Chicago. They date and
the next day she gets him to sing an opera aria at a senior citizen
center, which is well received in the newspapers. This gets his picture
in the paper with her and the attention of the jealous senator, who
immediately comes to Chicago, where he puts on the enraged boyfriend
act.</P>
<P>Her managers have a divided opinion about giving George a shot at
singing something spontaneously in her show, but she sides with giving
him a chance, as she aims to make opera more accessible to the public
and not to be only for the purists. To sing in public and why he can't
finish what he starts, becomes his battle with his inner demons. The
film  ultimately is about whom does she love more -- the artist or the
prominent politician. I bet you can guess who wins!</P>
<P>This was a likable but not a particularly moving tale. The characters
were pleasing, but no more. The situation they were in seemed realistic,
and the way they handled themselves gave the film its comedy sparks. But
what the film was missing, was sparks from the romance. What the film
also lacked was a more telling story and a bit more tension. It seemed
to be played too loose and easy, as if the problems that come his way
were part of the problems one would expect to find in any sitcom.
Nevertheless, I loved the atmosphere the film created -- of mixing the
stock workingman types with the stock opera types, and with George
cutting a nifty path to his destiny between his two chosen fields of
endeavor. As for the opera singing -- let me shout from the rafters,
Bravo!!!</P>
