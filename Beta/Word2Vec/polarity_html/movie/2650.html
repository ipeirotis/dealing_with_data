<PRE>      "Even a man who is pure in heart, 
      And says his prayers by night, 
      May become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms 
      And the Autumn moon is bright." 
          - THE WOLF MAN (1941) </PRE>
<P>     As the saying goes, "everything old is new again."  In the Fall of
1992, there was Francis Ford Coppola's version of DRACULA.  This
November, that will be joined by Kenneth Branagh's take on
FRANKENSTEIN.  And, in between, we have the Mike Nichols/Jack Nicholson
collaboration on the legend of THE WOLF MAN.  Less a remake than a new
exploration of lycanthropy, WOLF nevertheless recalls the days of
black-and-white horror films, when names like Bela Lugosi, Boris
Karloff, and Lon Chaney, Jr. topped marquees with the promise of chills
and shudders.</P>
<P>     For the most part, however, WOLF's strengths are in entirely
different areas than its most obvious inspiration, 1941's THE WOLF
MAN.  While both movies boast an excellent, almost-palpable sense of
atmosphere, and share some necessary plot elements, there the
similarities end.  This film brings the mythology into the nineties,
complete with corporate power struggles, cheating wives, and an
attempted mugging in Central Park.</P>
<P>     All WOLF demands of its audience is that they accept the idea that
a man bitten by a wolf can be mystically turned into that animal.  The
film is directed with sufficient flair by Mike Nichols, and acted ably
enough by its cast, to make this suspension of belief a facile task.
The problems surrounding the movie have nothing to do with its
premise.</P>
<P>     The picture opens with Will Randall (Jack Nicholson), the chief
editor at a New York City publishing office, driving down a snowy
Vermont road, using his sleeve to wipe away condensation on the front
window.  Suddenly, there's a shape ahead and his car slams into a
wolf.  When he gets out to investigate, he is bitten, and the infection
begins to have its sinister effects.</P>
<P>     The first changes are apparent in the sudden acuity of his sensory
perceptions and a marked shift in personality.  No longer a meek,
easygoing man, Will becomes decidedly "wolfish" in fighting for his job
when billionaire Raymond Alden (Christopher Plummer) takes over the
publishing firm and threatens to replace him with the weasel-like
sycophant Stewart Swinton (James Spader).  Will also gains a measure of
courage when it comes to dealing with members of the opposite sex, as
is displayed in his interactions with Alden's daughter Laura (Michelle
Pfeiffer).</P>
<P>     The office politics, and how Will's new "identity" affect his
dealings with his boss, co-workers, and clients, are masterfully
handled by Nichols, whose edge of satire is sharpened to its keenest.
The director might have been advised to spend more time in this
setting, because when his film moves outdoors, and the transformation
becomes literal, WOLF finds itself sputtering.</P>
<P>     As tremendous as the character interaction is, the "horror"
sequences, which feature rather routine transformations (courtesy of
makeup virtuoso Rick Baker), are flat.  Monster movies are supposed to
frighten the audience; this one fails utterly in that arena.  It's odd
to say that Nicholson isn't scary, but that's mainly because he plays
his character with a touch of subtlety that courts, and wins, the
audience's sympathy.</P>
<P>     The last half of WOLF is a disappointment.  The corporate
wrangling dissolves into the background as other, less-enjoyable
subplots take center stage.  Will's cautious relationship with Laura
(which includes inspired dialogue about what she wants in a man)
suddenly--and irrationally--turns passionately romantic, complete
with dumb lines like "I love you more than I've ever loved anyone
else."  And action and silly fangs are given too much prominence in an
unnecessary and misplaced climactic battle.</P>
<P>     The acting, both by the leads and the supporters, is solid.
Nicholson's restrained performance makes Will Randall believable and,
although somewhat underused, Michelle Pfeiffer still creates a
reasonably-balanced personality for Laura.  James Spader's Stewart
calls to mind another member of the animal kingdom--the rat.  Kate
Nelligan, Richard Jenkins, and Eileen Atkins all do fine jobs in small
roles, and Christopher Plummer's corporate tycoon is a delight to
behold.</P>
<P>     Ironically, it's the werewolf part of WOLF that's the least
successful.  Lacking the style and panache of the better elements of
the film, the scenes of Nicholson prowling on all-fours somehow fail to
impress.  Nichols successfully punctures the jugular when he focuses on
predators in suits; his efforts are less accurate when WOLF's attention
shifts to those with hair on their palms.</P>
