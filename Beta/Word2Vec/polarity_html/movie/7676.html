<P>     There can be many reasons for re-releasing a motion picture.  In 
some cases, like STAR WARS, the motive is as much for profit as it is 
for artistic reasons.  The same claim cannot be made of LE SAMOURAI, a 
1967 thriller that has been cited by no less an authority than 
internationally-acclaimed director John Woo as a nearly perfect movie.  
LE SAMOURAI will not rake in money at the box office during this, its 
thirtieth anniversary re-release, but it will give a small legion of 
North American movie-goers an opportunity to see this landmark film 
uncut and in its full glory.  </P>
<P>     Woo is right -- LE SAMOURAI is close to perfection.  It combines 
stylish direction, an intelligent script, first-rate performances, and 
overpowering atmosphere into one of the most tense and absorbing 
thrillers ever to reach the screen.  In trying to identify a film with a 
similar impact, I'm left grasping at thin air -- nothing quite like it 
exists in the annals of motion picture history, even when considering 
the work of Alfred Hitchcock.  However, watching LE SAMOURAI makes it 
obvious that directors like Quentin Tarantino and Brian DePalma are 
familiar with this particular entry on Jean-Pierre Melville's resume.  
Its influence upon their work is evident.</P>
<P>     LE SAMOURAI is developed like a chess game between two equally-
intelligent, determined opponents.  One, Jeff Costello (Alain Delon, of 
PURPLE NOON), is an expert hit-man whose deeds are untraceable and whose 
alibis are unbreakable.  The other is a police superintendent (Francois 
Perier) who is sure that Costello is responsible for a recent murder.  
He believes that, with dogged persistence, he can catch someone in a lie 
or uncover some discrepancy in his suspect's story.  As the movie 
progresses and an apparent checkmate draws closer, the level of tension 
in LE SAMOURAI reaches an almost-unbearable level.  One standout 
sequence has Costello attempting to evade an intricate trap that the 
superintendant has set for him in the Paris Metro.</P>
<P>     LE SAMOURAI opens with a quote from "The Book of Bushido" (a 
fictional creation of writer/director Melville):  "There is no solitude 
greater than a samurai's, unless perhaps it is that of a tiger in the 
jungle."  The film then proceeds to illustrate how this truth applies to 
the protagonist.  Alain Delon's performance is subtle and mesmerizing.  
His expression never changes, but his eyes, his bearing, and the 
occasional trickle of sweat speak volumes.  Delon has an undeniable 
screen presence -- when the camera focuses on him, we cannot help but 
look.</P>
<P>     The first thing that strikes the viewer about LE SAMOURAI is likely 
to be the aspect of the film that leaves the most lasting impression:  
its incredible sense of style.  This is a black-and-white noir film 
photographed in color, with gloomy exteriors and dim interiors.  It's 
always raining or cloudy, and the most prominent color is gray.  Even 
when a room is brightly lit, the source of illumination is inevitably 
harsh fluorescents that leech the color from everything.  Visually, LE 
SAMOURAI is arresting, but the movie's stylistic preeminence doesn't 
stop there.  Melville draws us into the cold, cruel world of his 
protagonist by presenting lengthy stretches in which there is no 
dialogue.  The film opens with ten minutes of speech-free scenes, 
followed by a short verbal interchange, then two more minutes without 
dialogue, another brief conversation, three additional minutes without 
talking, and so forth... Melville does not clutter up his film with 
needless chatter, and, as a result, when someone speaks in LE SAMOURAI, 
we listen.</P>
<P>     Delon is supported by a fine cast.  Francois Perier plays the 
superintendent as a canny policeman who will do whatever it takes to get 
his man -- he can be charming or nasty, as circumstances demand.  
Delon's real life wife (at the time), Nathalie, who plays Costello's 
lover and alibi, is every bit as sexy as Catherine Deneuve.  And Cathie 
Rosier portrays Valerie as the perfect mix of the enigmatic and the 
alluring.  She's one of the mysteries that Costello must solve if he's 
going to outfox the cops.</P>
<P>     If you're a fan of film noir in particular or thrillers in general, 
you owe it to yourself to seek out a copy of LE SAMOURAI (it should be 
released on video after its limited theatrical run).  Despite its 
absence on many critics "best of" lists, this motion picture deserves a 
place at the pinnacle of the genre.  As John Woo indicated, it's 
difficult to imagine a much more accomplished film.</P>
