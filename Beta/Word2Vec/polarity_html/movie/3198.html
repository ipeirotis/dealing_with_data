<PRE>                     MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Jennifer Jason Leigh, Campbell Scott, Matthew Broderick.
Screenplay:  Alan Rudolph and Randy Sue Coburn.
Director:  Alan Rudolph.</P>
<P>     The collection of authors, journalists and performers who gathered
for lunches at New York's Hotel Algonquin in the 1920s are among those
peculiarly American individuals who are perhaps more famous for being
famous than for anything they actually said or did.  There is a great
historical disagreement as to who was there at any given time, to whom
certain famous quotes should be attributed, and even whether those
quotes were actually spoken.  More than anything, they became symbolic
of the kind of dissolute Jazz Age bon vivants immortalized by
Fitzgerald and Hemingway.  But who were they, really?  At least part of
that question is answered by MRS. PARKER AND THE VICIOUS CIRCLE, an
uneven but still quite intriguing examination of the Algonquin Round
Table's most famous member.</P>
<P>     That individual was Dorothy Parker (Jennifer Jason Leigh), an
author and freelance critic who was renowned for her often caustic
theatrical reviews.  The film opens with Dorothy as a screenwriter in
1930s Hollywood, then flashes back to 1920s New York.  There Dorothy is
working for Vanity Fair with Robert Benchley (Campbell Scott), her
editor and close friend.  Her husband Edward (Andrew McCarthy) has a
war wound and a serious morphine addiction, and the marriage is far
from a happy one.  After Dorothy is fired from Vanity Fair and Benchley
quits in sympathy, they begin meeting with other journalists and
writers at the Algonquin.  Among those who join their company is
reporter Charles MacArthur (Matthew Broderick), with whom Dorothy has
an ill-fated affair which comes to define the tragedies of her life.</P>
<P>     Director and co-scripter Alan Rudolph is a disciple of Robert
Altman, and the mentor's style is as evident in MRS. PARKER as it has
ever been in Rudolph's work.  Altman's trademark overlapping dialogue
is particularly noteworthy, and it is one of Rudolph's most
questionable decisions.  The Round Table was defined by the volleys of
bon mots exchanged by its members, and while many clever lines come
through, nearly as many are drowned out by other conversation.  I often
caught uproarious laughter in response to a joke I hadn't heard.</P>
<P>     Now with the same breath that I knock Rudolph on practical
grounds, I must acknowledge that as an artistic choice, it is largely
successful.  Rudolph uses the interactions of these individuals to
demonstrate a superficiality which defined Dorothy Parker's world:
everyone at the table was too busy trying to be clever to pay much
attention to anything anyone else had to say.  "I write doo-dads,"
Parker comments in one scene, "because it's a doo-dad kind of town,"
and that remark speaks volumes about the Round Table regulars, and
perhaps even the Jazz Age as a whole.  As we watch Parker slip deeper
and deeper into depression, it becomes astonishing that none of her
so-called friends, with the exception of Benchley, ever seem to notice
or care.</P>
<P>     That relationship between Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley is
the backbone of MRS. PARKER, and it is captured in dead-on performances
by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Campbell Scott.  Scott has played mostly
pretty-boy roles to date, but his Benchley is a complicated character,
a teetotaling homebody who is pulled to his eventual destruction by the
people around him.  Leigh's performance is stunning, though she does
affect a speech pattern that sounds like a gin-soaked variation on her
Stanwyck/Hepburn bit from THE HUDSUCKER PROXY, and she seemed to
swallow many of her lines.  It's a piece of work made all the more
challenging by the odd structure of the script, which has Leigh playing
Parker at several different phases of her life, as well as reading
selections from Parker's poetry directly to the camera.  She manages to
capture the soul of an extremely troubled survivor whose final line in
the film ("I can't believe I made it") is both comic and touching.  Her
performance *is* MRS. PARKER, and through all of Rudolph's fits and
starts I found that I actually felt I had met Dorothy Parker.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 Round Tables:  7.</PRE>
