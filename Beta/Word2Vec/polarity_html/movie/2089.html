<P>     Dr. Nick Cavanaugh (Julian Sands) is obsessed by Helena (Sherilyn
Fenn), a woman with whom he had a brief affair and is now hopelessly
smitten.  Helena, however, feels nothing but disdain for Nick, and
shows it at every possible opportunity.  Nevertheless, one day the good
doctor manages to lure the object of his desires back to his home.  The
"romantic lunch" doesn't turn out as planned, but when Helena storms
away from his house and into the street out front, she's struck by a
truck and seriously injured.  Not wanting to lose Helena to a hospital,
Nick elects to operate in his home lab, amputating Helena's legs, then
keeping her captive during her convalescence.  When she becomes too
difficult to control, he takes things one step further and removes her
arms, turning her into "a possession."</P>
<P>     Like father, like daughter.  Those who expected a nice, normal
film from the offspring of actor/director David Lynch are in for a big
shock.  Jennifer Chambers Lynch has borrowed a lot of her father's
technique and style, and Mr. Lynch's own response to the film is that
he (not surprisingly) "really liked it."  BOXING HELENA is far from the
beaten track, covering subjects guaranteed to scare away major
Hollywood studios and big-name stars.  An example is Kim Bassinger, who
was signed to play the title role, then backed off when she discovered
that the script demanded her to play a character without arms and
legs.  She lost the battle in court, and BOXING HELENA won not only by
receiving a monetary settlement, but by having a much better actress in
the part.</P>
<P>     Suspension of disbelief is crucial to BOXING HELENA's success (and
the most probable reason it fails for those who dislike it).  So much
of what happens during the course of the film is impossible to accept
given the logical confines of the real world, so for those unable to
slip into the mood of the movie and naively accept the often-absurd
intentions of the film makers, BOXING HELENA will be a huge
disappointment--a mix of gigantic contrivances and impossibilities of
ludicrous proportions.  Of course, if one assumes that Ms. Lynch is
going for dark comedy, that changes the viewer's entire perspective of
the picture, shedding a new and warped light on some of what is
supposed to be serious (my own contention is that most--but not all--of
the humor is unintentional).</P>
<P>     Once it gets beyond a hard-to-swallow setup and into the meat of
its story, BOXING HELENA is surprisingly involving and
intelligent--especially considering how fingernail sketches of the plot
paint the movie.  The script is certainly not concerned about the
reality of circumstances and the actions of characters, focusing
exclusively on the weird and unusual relationship the develops between
Sand's Nick and Fenn's Helena, the inevitable captive/captor emotional
bond.  The movie discloses its terms early, and expects the audience to
buy into them, making no apologies for what it is or intends to be.</P>
<P>     There are powerful moments in BOXING HELENA, most resulting from
the interaction between characters.  Neither of the primary parts is
three-dimensional, but a fair amount of character development occurs
during the course of the movie.  A scene where Nick presents the
limbless Helena with a gun and offers to kill himself or her at her
request is effective because it touches on the core emotions
experienced by both parties.  There are other such scenes, but
intermingled with them are events better ignored--including a dumb
subplot involving the search of a boyfriend (Bill Paxton) for the
missing Helena, and an even dumber attempt to explain Nick's bizarre
actions through flashbacks to a neglectful, promiscuous mother.</P>
<P>     One of the things that works against BOXING HELENA is the
performance of its lead actor.  While Julian Sands doesn't precisely do
a bad job, he rejects subtlety in favor of overstatement.  While not an
over-the-top performance (take a look at what Bill Paxton does for one
of those), neither is it an example of studied, careful acting.  Too
often, Ms.  Lynch's direction mirrors the job done by Sands.  There are
a number of scenes that are handled in a rather heavy-handed way, with
a little too much meaningless symbolism thrown in for good measure.</P>
<P>     Fortunately, Sands' opposite, Sherilyn Fenn, is superlative,
giving an entirely credible performance as she turns a one-dimensional
part into a vibrant character.  It must be difficult to portray a
limbless puppet, but Ms. Fenn never falters, making us forever grateful
that the lackluster Kim Bassinger backed out.  Admittedly, Ms. Fenn
looks a little too good for someone who had gone through Helena's
trauma, but that's another area where suspension of disbelief comes
into play.</P>
<P>     The prosthetics of the amputations are never shown, and Ms. Fenn's
own limbs are hidden through simple trickery, so there's no real need
to comment on "special effects".  They are, in this case, no more or
less than are necessary to tell the story.  Although Helena's armless,
legless impotence might be somewhat macabre, it isn't presented
distastefully, resulting in a production that's more erotic than
misogynistic.</P>
<P>     A series of about five scenes comprises an ending which will
probably polarize viewers into two different camps--those that approve
of the choices made by Ms. Lynch, and those who feel cheated and
betrayed by them.  Personally, I accepted this part of the movie as
reasonable, and certainly no more outlandish than what went before.  A
great deal is explained that would otherwise have remained mystifying.
However, I disliked the final scene, especially the voiceover by Julian
Sands.  If Ms. Lynch wanted ambiguity, she should have left things as
they were; if she wanted a clear resolution, she should have added a
few more minutes of footage.  As it is, her mix of the two methods is
decidedly unsatisfactory.</P>
<P>     The general opinion will probably be largely negative, but there
are people who will love this film.  BOXING HELENA has elements to
recommend it, but there's a lot that has to be willingly overlooked to
get to that.  Cynical viewers will not enjoy it, except as something to
poke fun at.  My own opinion is divided, although I will admit to
having enjoyed the picture more than not, but any recommendation I make
comes with heavy reservations.</P>
