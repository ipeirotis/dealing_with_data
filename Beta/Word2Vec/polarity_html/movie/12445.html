<PRE>**Face Off**
Reviewed by Jeff Walters</PRE>
<P>      A couple of months ago, when I first downloaded the Face/Off
trailer from the Net, my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold
'yawn'. Followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key, not
wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this
piss-poor trailer. Then I started reading the first wave of reviews
from the U.S.....unique...excellent....must-see. Well, I thought still
skeptical, I suppose I might as well go see it when it gets here.
'Here', of course, was still three months away.</P>
<P>       I'll admit, when I trotted off to see this film, the only John
Woo movie I had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly
forgetable Broken Arrow. I'd heard good things about his previous work
with movies like Hard Boiled, but his films were definitely not on my
must-see list. That, let me tell you, has changed completely. I knew
this fact only five minutes into the film, after the brilliantly shot
and acted opening sequence where Sean Archer loses his son blew me off
my feet.</P>
<P>     The acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action
 flick. Seriously. I've never been a big John Travolta fan, but he,
like Cage, perfectly suited his role in the movie.....sorry, make that
'roles' in the movie. Even Travolta's great performance, however,
paled in  comparison to Cage's character portrayals. My favourite Cage
scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre Dietrich
Hassler's hideout. Half drugged out of his mind, he sits there
reclining back in a chair talking about his son's death from Castor's
perspective - "Doesn't it just break your heart." he mutters coldly.</P>
<P>         Now don't go thinking from the previous comments about
brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not. That's
what really makes this movie unique. It's an action movie with
brilliantly portrayed characters.....not a common mix at all.
Suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though.....that's
the only way to overlook the fact that Travolta and Cage fire around
5671 rounds at each other....and never hit.</P>
<P>         Several action scenes are just so well choreographed that
they just make wish that you could press 'rewind' and watch it over
again. The part where Archer and Troy have a stand off on either side
of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant. </P>
<P>     Whilst Cage's and Travolta's performances would be enough
alone to sustain most movies, the lesser characters are just as
intriguing. Joan Allen, who usually sticks to the straight drama
movies, plays her part perfectly as Archer's long suffering wife. I
like the fact that her character didn't end up toting a gun at the
end of the movie...it would have wrecked her potrayal. Gina Gershon
was surprising to say the least as Castor Troy's mistreated
girlfriend.....make that *one of* Castor Troy's mistreated
girlfriends. Other movies would have used her character as just window
dressing...a sex object, but instead her character is very strong and
independent. Dominique Swain, who plays Archer's daughter,
also does a nice job, though her character is not as explored as much
as Allen's or Gershon's.</P>
<P>     Faults? Well...there were some I have to say. First, the movie's
ending, whilst being very good overall, was a bit too drawn
out for it's own good. After the two combatants begin duelling again
after the final boat crash you can't help but think - "Geez, are
you guys nuclear powered or what?". There were certain bits that
weren't handled properly, like where Archer appears safe and
sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil
platform/prison - more explanation here would have been nice. </P>
<P>Overall, this movie was not perfect. But I thought it was about as
close as an action movie has ever came to perfect. Many
critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies
are made.....I certainly hope so. </P>
<PRE>4 1/2 stars out of 5</PRE>
