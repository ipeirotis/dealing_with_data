<P>starring Brad Renfro, Ian McKellan, Elias Koteas, David Schwimmer
screenplay by Brandon Boyce, based on the novella by Stephen King
directed by Bryan Singer</P>
<P>"No man is an island," one character quotes John Donne in APT PUPIL,
effectively summarizing the movie's themes. While hardly a great film,
Singer's ambitious adaptation of King's short story* is challenging
nonetheless; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement
psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it. APT PUPIL
is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses.</P>
<P>1984. Wonder-bred high school honours student Todd Bowden (Renfro)
conducts his own extracurricular investigation of Kurt Dussander, a Nazi
war criminal who fearfully fled Berlin in the 1960s and was never heard
from again. Bowden suspects Arthur Denker (McKellan), the lonely German
senior citizen who lives nearby, is actually a pseudonymous
Dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young Todd's
theory. Bowden strikes a deal with Dussander: in exchange for not
revealing his identity, Dussander must satisfy Bowden's intense
curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the Nazi
point of view. The stories he hears keep Todd up at night and haunt his
daydreams, but like a bystander at a traffic accident, Todd's desire for
gory details overrides his repulsion.</P>
<P>Bowden revives in Dussander feelings dormant since the end of WWII.
Marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for
Dussander: it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his
"student", among other things. Bowden, who has taken on very hateful
qualities (he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook),
engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship. Dussander
stands to lose his freedom, and Bowden his credibility-in effect, his
post-secondary school future. All of this winds down to a fairly
unpredictable (and unsettling) conclusion, one which requires leaps of
faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source
material's excessive climax.</P>
<P>Singer has yet to get Keyser Söze out of his system. His The Usual
Suspects and APT PUPIL are both about evil masquerading as innocence
(Verbal's tics and Todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses);
they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is
not an option if they are to achieve their goals. APT PUPIL is a richer
film than The Usual Suspects, a movie famous and popular partly because
its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way
you could see the ending coming, as it was all a hoodwink, anyway.
Thankfully, Singer has gotten most of The Usual Suspects' film-schoolish
geek theatrics out of his system. Some scenes in APT PUPIL feel
overdirected and/or obvious (the dream sequences were extraneous), but
the majority of the film is subdued-and Singer's handling of the violent
scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a
murderer-in-training. McKellan's and Renfro's performances contribute
enormously to the overall  success of the film; while most people will
focus on British stage vet McKellan's finely-tuned realization, I'd like
to single out Renfro's daring work. He isn't afraid to play someone
largely unappealing and cold-hearted; he strips his character of vanity,
something many of his peers wouldn't do. (Can you picture Kieran Culkin
or Jonathan Taylor-Thomas in the same role?) Renfro was recently charged
with possession of cocaine-I hope he doesn't continue down that path,
because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him.</P>
<P>As guidance counsellor Edward French, "Friend" Schwimmer also deserves
mention. He wants to be the parent to Todd that Todd's own well-to-do
folks are not (Todd, like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and
dad wrapped around his pinky finger), and his sincerity makes the apt
pupil's blackening-heart even more apparent. But one of the film's
ultimate questions, are we born evil or do we learn evil?, might be
answered in French, whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous. No
man is an island, indeed-we all have the capacity to make the "right" or
the "wrong" choices. Schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of
fascinating characters who make the unconventional APT PUPIL laudible.</P>

<P>     *The excellent collection King's stories called Different Seasons
spawned not only Apt Pupil, but The Shawshank Redemption (originally
titled Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption) and Stand By Me
(originally titled The Body).</P>
