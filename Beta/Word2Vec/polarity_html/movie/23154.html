<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>It's a rainy night in London in 1946, two distinguished looking men, old
acquaintances, meet, and one invites the other home to talk about
something that is troubling him. That person is Henry Miles (Stephen
Rea), who is a wealthy, high-level bureaucrat in the ministry office.
His friend is a writer, Maurice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes), who knew him in
1939 when he used his character for a story he was writing and was at
the same time having an affair with his wife Sarah (Julianne Moore). The
opulent home brings back to Bendrix the passionate memories of Henry's
wife, whose affair suddenly stopped for no reason that he could
determine in 1944, after London was bombed in an air-raid and the couple
just finished making love.</P>
<P>What has made Henry distraught, is that he thinks his wife is having an
affair, and he was thinking of going to a private investigation service
to have her followed. This arouses a jealousy in Bendrix, who offers to
go to the agency for Henry, after Henry tells him he can't do it and is
sorry he brought it up. Unknown to Henry, Bendrix goes to the Savage
agency and hires the private detective, telling him that he is not the
husband, but the lover who was jilted two-years ago, and is jealous of
her new lover.</P>
<P>Neil Jordan ("The Crying Game"/"The Butcher Boy") has brought to the
screen Graham Greene's very personal and passionate 1951 novel, which is
in many ways autobiographical, a mid-forties period piece, about his
illicit romance that also questions his faith, the Catholic one, in
which he is a convert to. Though in this big-budget mainstream film,
Fiennes' characterization of him is as a Protestant, while Sarah is the
Catholic convert, whose mother gave her that religion hoping that she
would accept its belief in prayers and miracles and not be influenced by
her non-believing Jewish father. Graham, known to be a subtle
anti-Semite, of the T.S. Eliott kind, always tries to get his digs in at
the Jews. The story is really about the battle in Greene's head; on the
one hand, he is the carnal Protestant and, on the the hand, he is the
Catholic (through Moore's character) believing in a non-physical love
with God. There seems to be a war going on inside him that has nothing
to do with the war England is fighting.What is presented onscreen is an
intelligent but somber look at how the three main characters cope with
their uneven lives and manage to act so civilized when feeling so much
pain at finding their lives to be unresolved.</P>
<P>The film is a constant flux between flashbacks and what is current. We
first see Bendrix at his typewriter, writing about hatred. He feels
betrayed that Sarah left him and despite their many happy days together,
he is filled only with pain. When he meets her, on the spiral staircase
of her home, for the first time since she left him, he remembers making
love to her. But, he acts coldly toward her when she goes to greet him
and he hurriedly leaves Henry's home.</P>
<P>When she calls him the next day, they make arrangements to meet at a bar
they once frequented. Their meeting is a troubled one, because he can't
hide his hurt and she can't tell him what is on her mind, and so she
gets upset and darts out of the restaurant, going into the Catholic
church to pray. Bendrix hears about her movements, as he is visited in
his humble but studious abode, by the private detective Savage assigned
to his case, Parkis (Ian Hart). At first, Parkis doesn't recognize that
it is him that he tailed, but when he does, he is apologetic. Bendrix's
gumshoe relates well to him. The gumshoe uses his son (Bould) as an
apprentice. He is an able young lad with a birthmark that covers a whole
side of his face. They do a thorough job of tracking down Sarah,
discovering that she meets with someone called Smythe (Isaacs), whom
they will later discover is a priest .</P>
<P>What transpires, as the director repeats scenes he already shot, hoping
to get each person's perspective, is the reason for her leaving him. The
most momentous day, is the last time Bendrix had sex with Sarah, during
the air-raid, when they just finished having sex and the doorbell rang
in Bendrix's house and he went down the stairs to answer it and the bomb
hit. Thinking he was dead, Sarah prayed to God, promising that if
Bendrix was alive she would thank God for that miracle and leave
Bendrix, and she would only love God. Thus becomes the film's laborious
theme, the war between her Catholic faith and his physical love.</P>
<P>Henry is played by Rea as a good-hearted but joyless soul, whose
marriage is based on kindness and friendly gestures but not on passion.
The ultimate insult the cuckolded husband receives, is when he returns
home and the lovers are into their climax, with Sarah screaming out as
Henry climbs the stairs and Bendrix asks: "What if he heard us?" Sarah:
"He wouldn't recognize the sound."</P>
<P>Fiennes is all carnal love and jealousy, they seem to go together for
him. What counts for him is to touch the one he loves. He plays the role
romantically, in an old-fashioned manner, exhibiting a relish for the
role. Sarah is the woman who was awakened to carnal love, in a role that
calls for open sex, showing the reason for her love affair with Fiennes
being so hard to forget. She has ultimately learned to accept the
religious message of a spiritual love as a higher one, one that is
eternal, where love does not have to be materialized, and is quite
willing to forego earthly love. Miracles are part of her faith, as she
can live contently with her beliefs in religious dogma. Julianne Moore
evoked a special passion to her role, she was able to mix the fire in
her with the serenity, making her performance a sublime one. The film
works mainly because of her. It works because even though she and
Bendrix experience the same hurts and joys, they interpret them
differently and have a different outlook in life. That is why it was
essential to film so many of their scenes over again, to witness how
each viewed the same experience they were having. The problem with that,
is the film seemed to move at a snail's pace, and had too much of a
vacuum between its intellectual messages and heavily passionate scenes.
Overall, it was a rather dull film, despite the fine performances, the
intelligence of the story, the able direction, and the beautiful
cinematography.</P>
<P>Though what's astonishing about Jordan's direction, is the mood the film
sets, being so nostalgic and intimidating, as if daring the viewer to
believe that this old-fashioned kind of genteel love story could also be
so daring in its passions, and challenging in its arguments about
jealousy, carnal love, and religious faith. This is all aided by the
splendidly vivid images and the expressive language of the sensitive
lovers trying to express their inner feelings. It is through Greene's
own words, where he relates how much more difficult it is to talk and
write about happiness than it is about pain, that one can understand how
the Moore role is most likely to be believed only by a true believer,
that words are inadequate to relate the joy she felt.</P>
<P>The film, as well-conceived as it was, was still too laborious of a
process. I think the story would have had more tension to it, if Henry
wasn't such a wimp and put up some kind of fight for his wife.</P>
