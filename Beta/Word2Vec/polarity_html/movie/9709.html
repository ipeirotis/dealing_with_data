<P>Ladies and gentlemen, 1997's INDEPENDENCE DAY is here!  It's title:
STARSHIP TROOPERS.  And surprisingly, it is more entertaining than
ID4.  I realize that I gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating,
but I was under the spell of the powerful first hour.  After
subsequent viewings, I feel that INDEPENDENCE DAY really wasn't as
great as it seemed--though I still give it a positive review.
STARSHIP TROOPERS, on the other hand, has a mocking sense of humor,
knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem.  As a result,
STARSHIP TROOPERS is a more exciting, energetic, and lively science
fiction film.  In fact, I probably could never get tired of watching
this film.</P>
<P>STARSHIP TROOPERS is very reminiscient of STAR WARS, another kick-ass
space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether.  While
STARSHIP TROOPERS is no STAR WARS, it comes quite close, and the
easiest assessment would be to call this film: "The 'Star Wars' of the
90s."  Am I being to generous to this film?  Perhaps, but when a
science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance,
effectively, into the warring races.  In essence, this is the science
fiction equivolence of Pulp Fiction.  The easiest way to write a
review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction
films, and I may have to.  STARSHIP TROOPERS is not quite an original
film persay, but director Paul Verhoeven gives the film a
"kick-the-aliens'-asses" style.  ID4 had this same style, except it
was forced, most likely the cause of Will Smith having a major role.</P>
<P>This new "Star Wars" has a very simple, basic plot: mankind vs. an
alien species.  The alien species in question here is the Bugs, a
seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects.  However,
the underlying morals of STARSHIP TROOPERS are fleshed out with deadly
accuracy.  Sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and
intense action scenes, but during quiet moments, we realize that
STARSHIP TROOPERS has something to tell us about our civilization.
More than likely, these morals will be overpowered and quickly
forgotten by the time the movie ends.  And they should be.  I doubt
Verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film.  This is
an "event" film, but surprisingly above average.  It is extremely
refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film, and actually root for the human
side (something INDEPENDENCE DAY never achieved).</P>
<P>STARSHIP TROOPERS begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange
"Join the Army" ads.  Mixing a Web-based interface, these summations
of events are refreshingly original.  Stating, "Would you like to know
more?", these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of
humor, and we know we should not take it seriously.  However, we also
witness the murder of several troopers in battle, in a gory, yet
funny, way.  After witnessing the slaughter, the film jumps back one
year, to setup what we just saw.  We are introduced to Johnny Rico
(Casper Van Dien) and Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards).  Rico flirts
with Carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school
classrooms.  However, Carmen isn't as interested in Rico as she is in
becoming a pilot.  However, another classmate, Dizzy Flores (Dina
Meyer), has her eye on Rico.  Unfortunately, Rico isn't interested in
Dizzy.  This setup is rather cliched, as is the result of the setup,
but it still is fun to watch.</P>
<P>Carmen signs up to become a starship trooper, and as a result, Rico
signs up.  And as a result, Dizzy signs up.  Everyone is assigned a
certain position in the academy: Carmen gets the pilot position she
wanted, Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris), a psychic, gets a position
in the training program, and Rico is left in the lowest class of the
Starship Troopers: the Mobile Infantry.  The main story follows Rico
through his trials and relationships.  In reality, I found myself
watching a space version of "Melrose Place," but with better special
effects.  An hour into the film, the war begins.  A sense of tension
grew in the audience I watched this film with.  The first hour may
have been a funny (sometimes unintentionally) setup, but we grew to
care for the flat characters, because no matter how hard I tried not
to like the characters, their gorgeous looks won me over (call me
superficial, if you must).  Following the training sessions, which had
many dramas in themselves (too many to mention here), the troopers are
sent to war.  The Bugs live on the planet Klendathu, a planet which
consists of dirt and rock, and pretty much nothing else.  Many dramas
occur during the war, until finally the troopers realize that their is
something behind the Bugs' attacks.  A sort of intelligence which
masterminds the defense.  The troopers are ordered to locate the
"brain" and capture it.</P>
<P>I hopefully left the plot as vague as possible, because STARSHIP
TROOPERS is not about plot.  It's about special effects and gory
violence.  Director Verhoeven, most known for his nudie film SHOWGIRLS
and BASIC INSTINCT, returns to his sci-fi days, which gave us good
films like Total Recall.  Verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the
MPAA, but despite all the violence, the comic book feel gives the film
a sense of falsehood.  STARSHIP TROOPERS is extremely violent, with
more gore than this year's EVENT HORIZON.  The R rating is well
deserved, and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old
children to see it.  My guess is that Verhoeven's target audience is
the 18 to 25 male group.  The film has a testosterone level off the
charts, with chiseled men and beautiful women.  Despite these
superficial elements, STARSHIP TROOPERS also creates a world which
made STAR WARS so successful.  While watching the film, we never
second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly
clear.  Thankfully, no hero is punching aliens in the face, which
gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with.</P>
<P>The cast of STARSHIP TROOPERS is quite annoying to begin with, but
they soon grow on you.  Casper Van Dien has the chiseled facial
features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon.  To most guys,
he will come across as artificial.  Fortunately, Van Dien is the worst
of the cast, despite how hard he tries to come off as a real
character.  Dina Meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her
character.  Her Dizzy is extremely likeable.  Denise Richards also
does a good job, and her scenes are very well done.  Jake Busey, Gary
Busey's son, gives a wonderfully funny performance, and provides one
of the biggest laughs of the film.  Neil Patrick Harris (remember, he
was Doogie Howser) is a little wooden, and slightly out of place with
the rest of the cast.  However, he does give a good performance.
Michael Ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher
with one arm.  His performance rises above the rest.  Perhaps it is
because his character is the most developed, but I think it is just
Ironside's presence on screen.  Unfortunately, no particular cast
member gives a star-making performance, which is too bad because the
material here could have made many of the cast members stars.</P>
<P>Director Verhoeven is the main star of the film.  His direction is
fast and unrelentless.  He never slows down his pace, which makes for
a wild ride.  Writer Edward Neumeier adapted the screenplay from the
book by Robert Heinlein.  The writing is usually very funny, and
sometimes very corny.  The dialogue is smart but not too smart.  We
aren't required to know everything, but some plot holes are left
unanswered.  Thankfully we are not intended to notice, and we really
don't (except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while).
Amazingly, with all the wars and romance going on, the screenplay
manages to include some surprising governmental issues.  In fact,
these governmental changes seem fairly plausible, and this adds
another layer to the story.  The moral debate of the characters is
quite surprising to find in a film of this genre, but what is even
more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage.
I haven't laughed this loud, even in some comedies.  Oh, and the
special effects are first rate.</P>
<P>STARSHIP TROOPERS is rated R for graphic sci-fi violence and gore, and
for some language and nudity.  Believe me when I say this: don't take
young kids to see this film.  It is extremely violent.  In fact, it is
probably the most violent film out this year.  However, if you are old
enough (over 17) to see it, STARSHIP TROOPERS is guaranteed to
entertain.  It's been a long time since I have cheered for the heros,
while also cheering for the bad guys.  And still, it is my dream to
see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind, and take
over the world.  Now that would be entertaining!</P>
