<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Edgar G. Ulmer (Detour/Strange Illusion/The Naked Dawn), the German
émigré to America, reportedly said that he directed 128 films in various
countries such as the U.S., Italy, Mexico, Spain, and Germany. Coming to
the States with Murnau, Ulmer worked on Sunrise (27) and Tabu (29),
before directing his first talkie, Damaged Lives, which told about the
early treatments for venereal disease. The 30-year-old director became
friends with Carl Laemmle, Jr., the Universal producer who thought of
him as an intellectual. He was the producer of the Black Cat and liked
Ulmer's idea of teaming up Karloff and Lugosi for the first time in a
film, and therefore encouraged him to make the film. Those two great
legends in the horror field went on from here to make a total of seven
films together, but none as co-stars with equal parts, or in a feature
that was as good as this one was. In most of their films together,
Lugosi, who was the poorer actor of the two because of his limited
English, was always cast in the lesser role.</P>
<P>Even though this film was supposed to be based on an Edgar Allen Poe
story, the Poe story was replaced by the work Ulmer collaborated with
George Sims, who wrote books as Paul Cain and film scripts as Peter
Ruric. Sim's fame rests on his articles for Black Mask magazine writing
as Paul Cain. His novel Fast One is considered by many as the best
hard-boiled novel ever. The script for this film was altered so much,
that the only thing remaining from Poe's story, is the brief appearance
of the black cat in the film. Though the film does evoke the mood of a
Poe story and the feelings of Kafka.</P>
<P>What influenced this film most, was the sensational trial of Aleister
Crowley, a Satanist who thought of himself as a personification of evil,
who took artist Nina Hammett to court because she ratted him out about
his devil-cult worship seances in her autobiography. The Crowley
characterization was by Boris Karloff, who played the role of Hjalmar
Poelzig.</P>
<P>The film begins with a journey for a young American couple on a
honeymoon to Hungary on the Orient Express, wishing to go to a honeymoon
resort in Gombos to consumate their marriage. Peter Allison (David
Manners) and his bride Joan (Jacqueline Wells), are a pair of bland
innocents, just having left their wedding reception to board the train.
The conductor tells them there has been a slight mixup regarding tickets
and that this strange, aristocratic fellow standing there, Dr. Vitus
Werdegast (Bela Lugosi), has been given the same train compartment as
they have and could they accomodate him. He is a noted Hungarian
psychiatrist recently released from serving fifteen years in a Russian
prison, a horrible place called Kurgaal, where one's soul is slowly
being robbed and few men return from there alive. He hasn't been home
for eighteen years since he joined the army.</P>
<P>When a traveling bag from the rack above almost falls on Joan, Vitus
muses philosophically in his heavy Hungarian accent, as he catches the
bag before it hits the startled girl, "It is better to be scared than to
be crushed."</P>
<P>When the trio's bus from the train station goes over an area the bus
driver tells them was one of the greatest battlefields of the war and is
now "the greatest graveyard in
the world," Vitus winces at the memories. That there were ten thousand
deaths here, and that on that hill over there, the architect Hjalmar
Poelzig (Boris Karloff) now lives, which was the site of Fort Marmaros
and then made into a concentration camp. That we learn from the bus
driver that he built the ultra-modern Bauhaus styled mansion on the very
spot that was the bloodiest one in the battle, which adds to the dark
mood of the night. Vitus will later on mention that Hjalmar was the
commander of that fort and sold out his own men to the Russians so that
he could spare his life. He has since become the leader of a satanic
cult. And, that he has been tracking him down ever since he learned that
he took his wife to America and other places in Europe, before coming
back here.</P>
<P>Due to the heavy rain, the bus looses control and goes over the side of
the road and Joan gets knocked slightly unconscious, so Vitus takes them
to Poelzig's mansion, where he bandages her superficial shoulder wound
and he also gives her a narcotic injection so she can sleep. Poelzig is
asleep with his wife, when his servant, the mute Majordomo (Egon
Brecher), awakens him and he arises in a stiff-manner with his
silhouette on the wall panel, and he walks trance-like in his pajamas to
greet his guests, not saying anything, but the relationship between the
two so-called friends is cordial but strained. While greeting  his
guests, Poelzig seems to look at Joan in a lustful way, as the innocent
Peter has no idea of what he got himself into. He will mention that he
is a writer of mystery books, and he quickly adds, books that are
unimportant, and that if he had any sense he would be honeymooning in
Niagara Falls. He is a characterization of the screenwriter, Peter
Ruric.</P>
<P>The theme of good versus evil unfolds as the men of science are locked
in a life-and-death conflict, as Vitus, along with his loyal mute
servant Thamal (Harry Cording), have come here for only one purpose, to
kill their evil Austrian host. Poelzig married Vitus's wife Karen
(Lucille Lund), after he went to prison, lying to her by saying her
husband was dead. When Vitus confronts him about where she is and where
his 18-year-old daughter is, he is told that his wife is dead, that she
died of pneumonia two years after the war and that his daughter is also
dead.</P>
<P>A very bizarre scene takes place when the black cat of the host appears
and Vitus becomes terribly agitated and throws a knife instantly killing
the cat with the glowing eyes. But Poelzig is not upset, as he says the
cat is deathless, "Deathless as Evil." He goes on to say, "It is the
origin of the common superstition. You know, the cat with nine lives."
He then offers an excuse for Vitus's action, saying he has a common
phobia, but in an extreme form. That the result is an intense horror of
cats. Vitus, visibly shaken, states that the black cat is a symbol of
evil. Also present in the room are Peter and his wife; she enters the
room in a sleepwalking state, moving as gracefully as a feline.</P>
<P>Vitus confronts Poelzig when the host visits his bedroom later on at
night by asking, "Where is my wife?" Poelzig then takes him to her, as
they both descend a staircase to arrive at the iron door of the dank
cellar and then go down a second flight of spiraling stairs into the
former old Ft. Marmaros, now a tomb-like mausoleum that houses the
underground vaults and they come upon a glass casement with Vitus's
beautiful wife preserved in it. There's not much action, but it is very
eerie to watch this strange scene.</P>
<P>Vitus can't take looking at this room filled with the embalmed former
lovers of Poelzig  anymore, calling out to Poelzig that he is a liar,
that he killed his wife, as he gets ready to shoot the man who took
everything from him that he loved, when a cat appears and the gun falls
out of his hands, and Poelzig takes it all calmly, saying let's not be
so melodramatic and play such childish games. He proposes that they play
a little game of death. But he says, we shall have to wait until these
people have gone and we are alone.</P>
<P>Poelzig when he is back in his room tells his young bride not to leave
her room while the guests are here, and he reads in bed a book
describing the Rites of Lucifer: it demands that a virgin be sacrificed
in its satanic ritual. This ceremony is to take place tomorrow night,
and Poelzig has his eye on Joan as his human sacrifice.</P>
<P>The next day Joan is fully recovered and the couple is ready to leave
this hideous place, while Vitus and Poelzig play a game of chess to see
if she is to be the sacrifice in the Black Mass ritual. Poelzig wins the
game, as he knew he would. But they are interrupted by two comical
policemen on bicycles, who question the guests about the accident last
night. When the American couple asks the policemen to give them a ride
to the train station, the police say it is not possible on their bikes.
Poelzig pretends to have his servant give them a ride in his car, but he
comes back to say the car is broken. The couple also find that all the
telephones are dead.</P>
<P>While trying to get out of the house with his wife, even to walk to town
if necessary, Peter gets knocked out by Thamal (he has been ordered by
Vitus to follow Poelzig's instructions), and he is locked in a room
downstairs, while she returns to the bedroom.</P>
<P>When Joan goes back to her room Poelzig's wife Karen (also played by
Lunt) accidently comes into the room, and as they start talking, it is
determined that her name is Karen Werdegast, and it is revealed to her
that her father is alive; and, to Joan, it becomes clear that Vitus's
daughter is not dead, but has married Poelzig. Angrily Poelzig comes
into the room, and ushers his wife out. He will kill her immediately in
a furious rage.</P>
<P>Vitus then comes into the room to calm Joan down and tell her he is on
her side, that he will kill Poelzig.</P>
<P>In the evening, the satanic cult ceremony takes place, with Vitus there
as one of the invited guests. The men are in black tuxedos and the women
are dressed in white for the ceremony. Poelzig leads the
devil-worshipping cult into the main hall of his house, and starts
chanting in Latin. Joan is tied up on a crucifix, as Poelzig chants a
litany over her body, offering her soul and body to Satan.</P>
<P>When one of the cultists faints, Vitus takes advantage of the confusion
and has his servant help him free Joan, and they quickly get her out of
the room. Peter has also freed himself from the locked room but gets
knocked out by the Majordomo. When the escapees meet the Majordome there
is shoot-out and the Majordomo is killed and Thamal is severely wounded.</P>
<P>Joan blurts out to Vitus the news about his daughter being alive and
married to Poelzig. In a crazed daze Vitus goes searching the house for
her, he eventually finds her dead on the table of the embalming room.</P>
<P>Peter having regained consciousness hears Joan's screams and asks her to
get the key to the room from the dead Thamal's hands that are clutching
it. But she isn't strong enough to, so Vitus takes time out from his
flailing and tries to help her, but Peter misunderstands Vitus's
gesture, thinking he is an enemy, and severely wounds him with a gun
shot.</P>
<P>Vitus tells the couple to get out of there fast, and they run out of the
house, as Vitus finds the switch for the house to be dynamited and sets
the timer for five minutes. He thereby blows all the cultist up as well
as himself and Poelzig.</P>
<P>The last shot in the film is of the relieved couple on a train to
Budapest, and Peter laughing about the mixed review his mystery novel
about a triple murder received from a critic, as the critic says that he
overstepped the bounds of credibility. Peter just stares incredulously
at his wife and they both chuckle.</P>
<P>The film is very strong on atmosphere, shot in the style of German
expressionism. It is not as strong on plot development or of the story
making complete sense. There are a number things that are left
unexplained, such as how did Vitus know about the dynamite and why did
Vitus order his servant to obey his enemy. But as a film shot originally
as a programmer for Universal, this horror film turns out to be a work
of true art, and is still one of the best horror films ever made. It is
a film of subtle and subversive gestures and one that sets a disquieting
mood. It scans the gamut in the field of the bizarre, from necromancy to
devil-worship. This is Ulmer's masterpiece, his defining work.</P>
