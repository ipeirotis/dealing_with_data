<P>ABOUT ADAM (director/writer: Gerard Stembridge; cinematographer: Bruno De
Keyser; editor: Mary Finlay; cast: Stuart Townsend (Adam), Frances O'Connor
(Laura), Charlotte Bradley (Alice), Kate Hudson (Lucy), Alan Maher (David),
Rosaleen Linehan (Peggy), Kathleen Bradley (Karen), Tommy Tiernan (Simon),
Brendan F. Dempsey (Martin); Runtime: 105; Miramax; 2000-UK / Ireland) </P>
<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz </PRE>
<P>A fluff sitcom, romantic comedy, that is so charming that it eventually
suffocates on all the charm it gives off. It is cleverly written and directed by
Irish playwright Gerard Sternbridge, who can't stop showing off how clever he is
able to make his main character. The film was shot almost a year before "Almost
Famous" made Kate Hudson into a celebrity, and a Golden Globe winner and Oscar
nominee for Best Supporting Actress. The American female lead spent some time
before shooting the film undetected in Dublin, as she perfected her Irish accent
and tried to convince everyone she met that she was Irish. She was able to do
that because of her then obscurity. Also, the film which was buried in mothballs
got a new lease on life through Harvey Weinstein and his Miramax people, and was
rereleased to a wider audience. In any case, Kate does a flawless Irish accent.
She's the daughter of Goldie Hawn and the step-daughter of Kurt Russell, which
should get her some attention in Hollywood circles. </P>
<P>The film is about a mysteriously engaging young man, Adam (Stuart Townsend), who
charms three sisters and ends up marrying one of them. He's a bullshit artist
extraordinaire, with an easy manner about him, who cunningly knows how to reach
out to women, which was mildly satisfactory for about 45 minutes of the film but
after that became annoying. His gracious smile soon looked too smug and
unbecoming, as the story had no particular meaning to it and I have seen too
many recent films with studs in it to care how this silly story resolved itself.
This film resolved itself in the cute way the story was heading, a 'feel good'
film for those with an amoral bent and a belief that having sex with as many
women as possible is the best thing one can do to improve relationships. </P>
<P>Lucy (Hudson) is a combined torch singer and waitress in a Dublin pub, who has
just ended a relationship with a pub comedian named Simon and is disheartened
that she can't find any of the local boys to love. When Adam enters the pub,
she's immediately attracted to him and happy that he's both so shy and friendly.
She invites him home on their first date and he meets the entire family. Mr.
Right impresses her widowed mom Peg (Linehan) with his clean-cut looks; her
brother David (Maher) is attracted to him physically and charmed by his way with
women; younger sister Laura (O'Connor), a bookish 19th-century scholar doing a
thesis on the sexual habits of Victorian women, is impressed by his sensitivity
and that he can quote poetry from one of her favorites, Christina Rossetti;
older married sister Alice (Bradley) finds him alluring compared to her boring
husband Martin (Dempsey); Martin is impressed with Adam's classic vintage
Jaguar, which makes him a somebody. </P>
<P>With predictable relish Adam charms all three sisters with different approaches
and takes all to bed. When David seeks help in getting his girlfriend Karen to
bed, Adam obliges. But the plan to get David in bed with Karen backfires, as
Adam winds up taking her to bed. But by morning, Karen is in such a joyous state
that David gets a chance to use the hard-on, he had while temporarily sharing a
bed with Adam, on Karen. </P>
<P>For all the main characters there's a voice-over used to spell out their
thoughts and also captions of their thoughts are at times flashed onscreen.
Scenes are also repeated so we get reactions from different individuals. For
instance, at Lucy's pub, while onstage, she asks Adam to marry her. When he
accepts: Peg is happy, Laura is devastated, and Alice is surprised. </P>
<P>The film's main purpose seems to be in showing what a likable rake Adam is --
that he is willing to meet the needs of whomever he's with. He proves that
having secrets in a relationship can add spice to it and make it an even more
serene and lasting one. This is contrasted with Adam being shown by the film's
end as a pathological liar and an uncaring  sexist. The film's image of him left
me confused about what I was supposed to think of him. But my gut reaction is, I
had a belly full of this guy long before the film ended and therefore found this
vacuous story unsatisfying. It was like I was being asked to overlook 
Adam's failings and be won over by his obviously trite charms. I wasn't and
therefore didn't care for Adam, or the film, or did I particularly care for any
of the sisters. The only thing I liked in the film was the Jaguar, and I didn't
care how Adam got it or what story he told about how he got it. There's a
running gag throughout the film, how Adam tells different versions of how he
obtained the Jaguar to whomever he's with. That was supposed to be funny and
show that he might have some problems with telling the truth. </P>
