<P>     At various points during Disney's THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE, it
becomes apparent that it could have been a mediocre-at-best piece of
animated film-making. Here there's a significant lack of detail in the
background animation; over there, a gaping hole where a catchy tune might
have buoyed the proceedings; throughout, a narrative that doesn't exactly
set the world on fire. Yes, it's all pretty tepid stuff -- and then a
character will open his mouth, and set you to giggling uncontrolably.
After years of watching its animated features soar on various permutations
of stunning visuals, engaging story-telling and memorable songs, Disney
has finally made a film that succeeds almost exclusively on the strength
of its vocal performances.</P>
<P>     And it does so by a fairly narrow margin. The straightforward plot
focuses on Kuzco (voice of David Space), an arrogant teenage emperor of a
culture somewhere in pre-Colombian America. Kuzco is on the verge of
turning the family home of a gentle peasant named Pacha (John Goodman)
into a summer palace when he invokes the ire of his nasty advisor Yzma
(Eartha Kitt). With the aid of her simpleton henchman Kronk (Patrick
Warburton), Yzma slips Kuzco a potion that turns him into a llama.
Stranded alone in the jungle, Kuzco's only chance of returning to his old
imperial, human self is  you guessed it, the same gentle peasant whose
family home he was set to destroy. Bonding and learning of important
lessons ensues.</P>
<P>     In a way, the whole business is quite beneath Disney. Much of THE
EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE feels cobbled together as an afterthought, as though
the real A-team Mouseke-thinkers were too busy making FANTASIA 2000 or
figuring out how to promote 102 DALMATIANS. While the character animation
is effective, virtually everything else is about as eye-catching as your
typical Hanna-Barbera background. The progression of the story is bland,
with only a couple of really good action set pieces to liven things up.
Meanwhile, the music is left to score composer John Debney (okay, but
unmemorable) and the songwriting tandem of lyricist Sting and composer
David Hartley (whose two numbers feel jarringly out of place in the
otherwise non-musical film).</P>
<P>     Not exactly the stuff of which Disney animated "classics" are made,
at least until the voice actors get to strut their stuff. David Spade
provides the perfect petulant, all-about-me vibe for Kuzco, though it
certainly helps to be in tune with Spade's typical caustic sense of humor.
As the villainous Yzma, Eartha Kitt growls her role with such delicious
malevolence it boggles the mind that she has never been cast as a Disney
animated villain before. But the real show-stopper is Warburton's Kronk,
one of those essentially decent lunkhead sidekicks who eventually do
their evil bosses more harm than good. The part is a familiar one, but
Warburton delivers his lines with such a combination of deadpan idiocy and
absolute sincerity that nearly every syllable out of Kronk's mouth is
hilarious. Screenwriter David Reynolds provides some clever dialogue, but
it's not nearly as good as the people who bring it to life.</P>
<P>     The one weak link in the cast is Goodman, though it's not really his
fault. Pacha is as personality-impaired a character as Disney has created
in a long time for a central role (okay, probably since POCAHONTAS). He's
not exactly the hero, not exactly the comic relief -- he's just the big,
good-natured guy necessary to move the plot along. Considering the
relative blandness of the plot itself, there are all kinds of reasons to
suspect that THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE should have been a dud.
Congratulations to Spade, Kitt and Warburton -- and to the casting
director -- for giving the film the spark the rest of the creative team
couldn't quite manage.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 jolly llamas:  6.</PRE>
