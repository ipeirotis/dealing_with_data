<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>A splendid TV movie remake of Fritz Lang's 1941 Man Hunt. Peter O'Toole
is the aristocratic British hunter, Sir Robert Thorndyke, who attempts
to assassinate Hitler in 1939, before war was declared. He is caught
outside Hitler's vacation retreat and tortured, having the nails from
his fingers torn off. When the Germans decide to make his death look
like a hunting accident for political reasons and push him down a cliff,
they are startled when he is not there the next day. In order to get out
of Germany, O'Toole gets help from a fisherman and then stows away on a
British boat, which takes him back to London.</P>
<P>In London, things are not over for O'Toole. He is followed by German
agents and realizes that he can't remain at home. This thriller becomes
very tense, with O'Toole, an expert on hunting now the one who is
hunted. He gets help from his Jewish lawyer friend (Harold Pinter), and
flees to the English countryside. But it is an adventure for him to get
out of London, as he is followed in the underground and must elude a
German agent who tries to kill him on Holborn Station. O'Toole manages
to kill him by laying a trap for him, whereby the agent gets
electrocuted. He now becomes wanted for murder.</P>
<P>While in Dorset, he goes to the postmaster to pick up a letter from his
lawyer, but the postmaster recognizes him from his sketch in the
newspaper and calls the police. After escaping the police with a bullet
in his shoulder, he is trailed by two other German pursuers, an
anti-Semitic Major Quive-Smith (Standing) who works for the Nazis, and
his underling, Muller (Ian East), who just does what the major tells him
to do.</P>
<P>Quive-Smith corners him in the underground hole he was hiding in and
tells him that he will kill him unless he signs this incriminating
document he has prepared for him. Somehow O'Toole tricks him and manages
to execute him and escape to safety. Back in London he talks with his
uncle (Sim), and tells him about his escapade. His uncle, who worked for
the maligned ex-prime minister, Neville Chamberland, tells him that the
new prime minister, Winston Churchill, heard about him and would like to
meet with him.</P>
<P>O'Toole's performance is the thing here. He is a prime example of
British royalty and he is eccentric, displaying impeccable manners, and
a roguish way of looking at things. His attempt on Hitler's life is an
extraordinary thing to do...though why he does it is only given a fuzzy
interpretation. Via flashback, we learn that the woman he loved, Rebecca
(Cyd), goes back to Germany and is executed by the Nazis. Clive Donner
makes O'Toole grow into a character that is larger than his country,
playing off his petulance, his wit and charm, against his daring skills
to look death in the eye and heroically escape his pursuers. What the
filmmaker does, is have O'Toole make great scenes out of conventional
ones. In one scene he is hiding in a dark hole, talking more humanly to
the black cat who keeps him company than he does to the turncoat major
who unsuccessfully tries to converse with him like they are equals, but
whose eyes bulge with hatred and whose life belies a sick interpretation
of what the truth is. Even though O'Toole is the one trapped in the
hole, the major seems to be the one suffocating on the truth, even as he
puts on an air of decorum and lays it into his captive, his talk just
sounds like jabbering when compared to O'Toole's. In this film, not
being able to talk properly, means that you are more of an animal than
an animal is.</P>
<P>"Rogue Male" is an updated "Man Hunt," that has been filmed after the
war, allowing it to have no pretences about how evil the Nazis really
were.</P>
<P>The movie's title comes from the fact that when an elephant gets
separated from the herd, he's known as a rogue male-- and he's
dangerous.</P>
