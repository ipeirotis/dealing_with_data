<P>[Warning: The very nature of this review may involve plot spoilers for
viewers who have not yet seen the film.]</P>
<P>     Of all the benefits I have received from being a film critic, I may
value innocence the most.  It may seem an odd choice of words in a
profession more often associated with cynicism, but it applies
nonetheless.  While the onslaught of studio publicity is impossible to
avoid completely, the ability to attend press screenings serves as
something of a buffer against expectations.  It was impossible for me to
react to the BLAIR WITCH hype since I had written my review six months
before its release; I never needed to guard against becoming aware of key
CRYING GAME-esque plot points.  It was possible for my viewing experience
to remain relative untainted, subject only to pre-conceived notions for
which I could have no one but myself to blame.</P>
<P>     It took the release of THE SIXTH SENSE for me to realize how much
that innocence can matter.  After missing the press screening due to
scheduling conflicts, I became aware that this story -- Malcolm Crowe
(Bruce Willis), a troubled child psychologist, tries to help even more
troubled 9-year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) with the child's ability 
to see dead people -- contained a "twist" or "surprise" ending.  Reviews
and discussions meticulously avoided revealing the specific nature of the
ending, but by then the damage had been done.  I considered everything I
knew about the film, and made an educated guess regarding what would be
revealed in its closing moments.  Then I finally caught up with the film,
and watched with my "can I out-guess the writer" glasses on.</P>
<P>     Within twenty minutes, it was obvious that I had guessed correctly.</P>
<P>     I'm not going to suggest that it was particularly clever of me to
figure it out.  I will suggest that I probably wouldn't have been testing
my cleverness if I hadn't known there was something to be figured out.
The simple knowledge that there was a plot point to be sussed out set me
to sussing.  And I spent as much of the film nodding to myself at the
clues I recognized as I did trying to get caught up in the story.</P>
<P>     The nature of the film made such behavior both a blessing and a
curse.  Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's pacing is so agonizingly
deliberate that I was delighted to have something else on which to train
my attention.  Conversely, I was able to give Bruce Willis's monotonous
performance a bit more benefit of the doubt, and admire the craft which
allowed Shyamalan's little trick to seem plausible.  The only constant to
draw me from my reverie was Osment, a sublimely effective child actor
whose performance alone is enough to recommend THE SIXTH SENSE.  Children
in jeopardy are usually a narrative cheat, but Osment's reactions to his
situation are always more compelling than Shyamalan's few moments of
thriller gimmickry.  The irony is that my connection with Cole's plight
was consistently undercut by my awareness that the film's payoff would
focus on someone else.  </P>
<P>     Perhaps my long-standing aversion to physician-heal-thyself
psychologist/psychiatrist characters (coincidentally sparked by another
Willis film, the ghastly COLOR OF NIGHT) turned me off to Malcolm as an
equal player in the story.  Perhaps the supernaturally comforting closing
shot reminded me too much of GHOST.  Perhaps the big emotional moment for
Toni Collette (as Cole's mother) felt like a cheat because her character
hadn't been developed at all.  Or perhaps I never bought the entire arc of
Malcolm's story from the outset.  It's hard for me to know whether it was
the film itself or my constant view of its wires which left me
unimpressed.  </P>
<P>     The success of THE SIXTH SENSE suggests that it has struck an
emotional chord in many viewers.  For me, the only chords it could strike
were technical.  There was a not-particularly-inspired gag often used by
TITANIC detractors during its theatrical run, something along the lines of
"what's the point, you know the boat's going to sink."  Most of the time,
it's even true.  Next time, I hope I don't go into a film knowing whether
or not the boat is going to sink.</P>
