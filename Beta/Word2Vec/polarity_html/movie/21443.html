<P>To me, Nicolas Cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a
Martin Scorsese film. Despite the rantings that Sean Penn so rudely
expressed, the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence.
Ever since the big success of the action-thriller `Face/Off' in 1997,
the Hollywood road has been a rocky one for Mr. Cage. The perpetually
awful assassination thriller `Snake Eyes' was one of 1998's worst films.
`8MM' was a disappointing lost cause. But who better than Scorsese to
match Cage's wit and intensity, which he does in miraculous fashion with
`Bringing out the Dead'.</P>
<P>Cage delivers one of his finest performances as Frank Pierce, a New York
City Emergency Paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day. After
five years of the stress-inducing job, Frank basically just staggers
onward, relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift
finally ends. He also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died
under his care, namely a young girl named Rose, who stares back at him
with pale features at every street corner in New York. Frank desperately
wants to be fired, but his boss needs him to scour the city and help
those in need (`I'll fire you tomorrow...' he promises).</P>
<P>Frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance. The
first is Larry (John Goodman), who always has food on the brain. The
second is Marcus (Ving Rhames), a deeply religious black man who
incorporates the power of Jesus into a regular rescue operation. And
finally, Tom (Tom Sizemore) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood. I
found it unique how Scorsese used each of these characters for a single
shift with Frank, but they never figured into the actual plot. Each is
merely a colorful presence to help develop Frank's character, because
`Bringing Out the Dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and
detailed personality.</P>
<P>The one character alongside Frank that truly comes into play is Mary
(Patricia Arquette), the daughter of a newly admitted patient who
suffered from a severe heart attack.  Arquette, who recently received
the wounds of Christ in `Stigmata', performs well around real-life
husband Cage. It's unfortunate that, after such intriguing character
trials and tribulations, the relationship between Frank and Mary slips
during a mishandled, ineffective finale. The movie belongs to the
one-two punch of Cage and Scorsese, who were born to collaborate their
efforts in an arrangement similar to `Bringing Out the Dead'.</P>
<P>Although it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like
`Goodfellas', Scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture.
The incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of
brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration. Fans will be
pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive, darkly
humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `Kundun'. Does
`Bringing Out the Dead' rival Scorsese's finest work? Only occasionally.
Some of the film feels surprisingly limp, but there is enough energy in
it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice.
Those expecting a grisly, risqué product may be somewhat disheartened at
the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid, admirable
effort.</P>
<P>`Bringing Out the Dead' was written by the acclaimed Paul Schrader, who
collaborated with Scorsese on such classics as `Taxi Driver' and `Raging
Bull'. Schrader's script is full of moments - wonderful, sharply defined
moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering
screenplay. The exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding
technical credits and the amazing cast. Goodman and Sizemore are both
electric (well, mainly Sizemore), but it's the phenomenal Ving Rhames
who deserves a second look. Watch the actor's deeply inspired dedication
as he resurrects a gothic band member, and you'll understand why he won
a Golden Globe.</P>
<P>`Bringing Out the Dead' is raw and electrifying often enough to mask
it's certain flaws. Scorsese - and Cage, for that matter - have done
better, but their intentions are certainly admirable.</P>
