<PRE>The Way Of The Gun </PRE>
<P>Remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the 
rage? "Pulp Fiction" and "Fargo" both managed to get Oscar nominations for 
the Best Picture, and not surprisingly, a slew of rip-offs followed in the 
years thereafter. That fad seems to be over but here comes Christopher 
McQuarrie writing and directing "The Way Of The Gun" that at first glance 
looks like another of those wanna-be's but upon closer inspection doesn't 
look like anything comprehendable. It's a crime story so wrapped up in its 
own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won't allow 
the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow 
still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its 
ridiculous. </P>
<P>Complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who's familiar with 
McQuarrie, he wrote "The Usual Suspects," which has become a cult favorite 
despite little critical acclaim. That film had a great story and was well 
directed but had such an elaborate, confusing screenplay it leaves many 
viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings. You have to wonder if 
McQuarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the 
Hollywood idea that "if it's really confusing and about criminals and cops 
that makes it fascinating." With "The Way Of The Gun" McQuarrie seems to be 
capitalizing on the same idea, but this time the story is far less commercial 
- a shame because maybe that would have helped. </P>
<P>The film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason 
to live but aren't hell-bent on death either (played by Ryan Phillipie and 
Benecio Del Toro). They get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a 
big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in 
vitro fertilization. They figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother (played 
by Juliette Lewis) and get a nice ransom. Along the way we continually learn 
of the shady dealings between the exec, his wife, their hired goons and the 
"bag man" (played by James Caan - the only actor in the film who looks like 
he knows what he's doing). The exec is some kind of money launderer so he 
obviously can't call the authorities for help. His goons and the bag man are 
on the kidnappers' trail and each make different offers to get the mother 
back. The exec's son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants 
to make sure his patient is all right. Meanwhile each of these characters has 
something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses, secret 
love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it 
has any relevance at all. </P>
<P>McQuarrie doesn't know the meaning of the word simple. He seems to be more 
interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie. 
Everything has to be complicated and confusing, so much so that it's to the 
point of surrealism. Nothing is what it seems in this reality, it's one of 
those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal 
world and are expected to know most of the industry's rules and regulations. 
Every scene with Caan's character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers 
already know who he is and even chat with him, getting into conversations 
about "the business" and how it works and we're hardly given a clue as to 
what they're talking about. </P>
<P>These characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but 
they're more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in David Mamet's 
trash. No one here really acts like a real person, and the story is even 
further removed from reality. It's like a dream without any appeal. </P>
<P>Take the opening scene for example; the Phillipe and Del Toro characters are 
in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money 
and stuff. They sit on a brand-new Mercedes and the car alarm goes off, the 
owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they 
don't move. The guy and his loud-mouth, potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 
other people cross the street and gang up on them. You'd think Phillipe and 
Del Toro are going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don't, 
instead Phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob. There's 
a lot of things I didn't understand about this scene: first of all the owner 
of the Mercedes isn't some yuppie or old rich snob, he's like a hippie 
straight out of the 60s. Secondly, the two main characters seem to believe 
that they can actually take on the mob unarmed. Lastly, it serves no purpose 
in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery 
than a small country's army. If they were suicidal they wouldn't have gone on 
the kidnapping job in the first place (and where they get all those guns is 
never explained either). </P>
<P>There's a lot more I could pick apart about this film but that would be an 
exercise in futility. What it all comes down to is that nothing here is what 
it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any 
other story than what it is. Absolutely none of the characters are likable or 
believable. And it's all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is 
good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out 
black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill 
screen time. </P>
<P>With any film you see, whether you like it or not, you can at least 
understand what the appeal was to it, why someone would want to make it and 
why someone would want to see it. I can't say either for "The Way Of The 
Gun," because it has very little going for it and I can't imagine anyone 
intelligently defending it. </P>
