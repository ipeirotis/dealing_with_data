THREE SEASONS (director: Tony Bui; cast: Don Duong (Hai), Nguyen Ngoc
Hiep (Kien An), Tran Manh Cuong (Teacher Dao), Harvey Keitel (James
Hager), Zoe Bui (Lan), Nguyen Huu Duoc (Woody), 1999)</P>
<P>Saigon is a different place from the days of  the Vietnam war, when we
defended the corrupt government of the South against the attacking
communist forces from the North, and lost that unpopular war-- a war
that heatedly divided our country, as well. To go back and see what that
city is like now, should be interesting, especially since there is very
little media coverage of Saigon that reaches main street America. The
26-year-old director, whose family escaped Vietnam when he was a two
year old to live in California, has gone back to find his roots and
observe his people and see how they live today.</P>
<P>This rather sentimental elegy to his country, plays much like a
travelogue, bent on painting a pretty picture of the country despite the
sad tale it tells of four diverse, gentle souls, whose symbolic
fictionalized venture will prove to be very touching, as we follow them
around Saigon and observe them as their lives sometimes interact with
each other.</P>
<P>What the film lacks is a real poet's cutting edge and tension, and what
is also astonishingly absent, is a view of the political situation. But
what is even more astonishing, is the complete lack of anger from those
who are poor, whose lives are so polarized from the very rich.</P>
<P>There is little risk taken here by the director, who has shot a
purposefully fictionalized account of Vietnam, showing only that it is
being swallowed up by capitalism and its own passivity. But he is not
blaming anyone for what happened. Forgiveness, he implies, is the basis
of Vietnam's onward existence. The Coca-Cola signs and the luxurious
hotels serve only as reminders that this country is being overtaken by
commercialism and greed, nevertheless the director seems content to film
his picturesque view of the city, as is, of these materialistic
intrusions appearing without any kind of analysis as to why. The pastel
colors of the film and the brightness of the city, allow even the
squalid slum section of town to appear to be picture perfect.</P>
<P>All four of the main characters the story follows, are victims of the
country's past war, who are now trying to cope with their situation by
understanding what it is that they are now feeling that weighs heavily
in their heart.</P>
<P>The film opens on the site of an opulently lush lake with Kien An
(Nguyen Ngoc Hiep), who is part of an all-female work force hired to
pick white lotus blossoms on the temple estate of an embittered recluse.
He is passing himself off as a poet and some kind of wise man, who can
feel the beauty of nature in his soul. This first story relates to the
beauty found in the spring weather as observed for the harvesting of the
lotus.</P>
<P>After gathering their crop, where the women sing traditional songs, they
go to Saigon and sell their flowers on the streets. Competition arises
for Kien An, as vendors of plastic scented imitations do a better
business than she does.</P>
<P>When she sings a different song from the other women's, the boss
recognizes it as a song from his happy youth, when he was so filled with
enthusiasm for life, until he developed leprosy
and lost all his fingers, and retreated from life by hiding in the
shadows, embarrassed that children made fun of him when they saw him.</P>
<P>Kien An writes down the poems he dictates to her, that are filled with
so much pain and beauty. The heavy-handed symbolism in her story relates
to how this country can't face its true self anymore, blaming itself for
the disease it caught.</P>
<P>The next story is even cornier, as the romantic Hai (Don Duong), a cyclo
driver, falls in love with Lan (Zoe Bui), a $50 a trick prostitute. Hai
courts the snobbish whore in his cyclo, giving her rides from the luxury
hotels in which she does her business back to her slum area apartment.</P>
<P>When Hai wins $200 in a cyclo race, he then pays for her services, and
the haughty Lan turns out to be a frightened girl, who is confused and
unsure of herself. Another symbolic message, this time relating to their
country and how it must learn to love itself without being gobbled up by
foreigners. The season is summer and it is extremely hot.</P>
<P>Next we have a street urchin peddler of trinkets, Woody (Nguyen Huu
Duoc), a boy of eight or nine, who tries to sell a lighter to James
Hager (Harvey Keitel) in the Apocalypse Now Bar. He is an ex-marine
looking for the grown daughter he fathered, but has never seen, while
stationed in Saigon during the war.</P>
<P>The kid's suitcase is stolen, and he spends the remainder of the film
searching in the rain for the thief stealing everything he possesses
that is of value, who he thinks is Harvey. Again, these characters are
symbolic-- Harvey, for our country to put a closure on the past; and for
the kid, to get in off of the monsoon rain and become strong in spirit,
because he is the future of the country.</P>
<P>Everything gets tidied up in nice little packages by the film's end and
every one walks away enchanted, and this very picturesque take on
Saigon, that seems to be a love affair the director is having with his
ancestral country, turns out to be an irksome charmer to behold. It
lacks what it thinks it has: poetic vision. There is not much substance
in its lyrics, and its beauty can only be taken as skin deep. When we
think about what this film was saying, there is not much there that is
perceptive enough to add something worthwhile to its lugubrious tale.
The plain truth is, that there was just nothing striking said during
this well-crafted film to hold our attention. It was mostly an arty kind
of mush, fed to a Western audience that is dying to see something nice
about Vietnam, even if that something can't get past being sentimental
jive. The clichéd story had too many coincidences and improbabilities in
it, and an incomplete picture of how this city now functions, for its
story to be considered as being relevant to the topic it covered, except
by those who are pleased and willing to see something about Vietnam that
lets them forget about the war and the terrible conflicts it brought to
both countries.</P>
