<PRE>                           WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
                       A film review by Scott Renshaw
                        Copyright 1995 Scott Renshaw</PRE>
<P>Starring:  Sandra Bullock, Bill Pullman, Peter Gallagher,
           Jack Warden, Peter Boyle.
Screenplay:  Daniel G. Sullivan and Fredric Lebow.
Director:  Jon Turtletaub.</P>
<P>     When--and for that matter, why--did SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE
become the sine qua non for any critical blurb for a romantic
comedy?  "This year's SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE!" they rave, or
"SLEEPLESS IN (insert name of city in which film is set here)."
Actually, the "why" part is easy; SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE was a huge
box office success and an easy point of reference for an idealized
modern romance.  WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING is already drawing
comparisons to the 1993 hit with some basis, but not because Bill
Pullman is in the cast or the word "sleep" is in the title.  Both
funnier and more genuinely romantic than SLEEPLESS, WHILE YOU WERE
SLEEPING seems destined to be for Sandra Bullock what SLEEPLESS was
for Meg Ryan:  the vehicle that stamps her as one of the few
genuinely bankable female stars in Hollywood.</P>
<P>     Bullock stars as Lucy, a token collector for the Chicago
Transit Authority.  Mostly alone since the recent death of her
father, Lucy fantasizes about a handsome businessman (Peter
Gallagher) who takes the train every day.  Their lives cross in an
unexpected way when Lucy saves the man's life after he falls onto
the train tracks and ends up in a coma.  At the hospital, Lucy
learns that the man's name is Peter Callaghan, that he has a large
and loving family, and that through a series of misunderstandings,
the family believes that Lucy is Peter's fiancee.  Delighted at
being welcomed into the family, Lucy plays along, until Peter's
brother Jack (Bill Pullman) arrives.  Although Jack is initially
suspicious of Lucy, a friendship grows between the two, a potential
romance complicated only by Peter's recovery.</P>
<P>     In many ways, the recent film of which WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING
reminded me most was not SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, but GROUNDHOG DAY.
It has a paper-thin, high-concept premise which at any moment could
have collapsed under the weight of its contrivances.  But it never
quite happens; just when you expect the script to go in a
predictable direction, it doesn't.  Writers Daniel G. Sullivan and
Fredric Lebow don't load the story with awkward little situations
that Lucy gets out of by sheer coincidence (although naturally there
are a few), nor do they resort to farce or slapstick.  Indeed, they
provide a surprisingly touching story about mutual need and
affection, with Lucy finding herself drawn to the family she lacks,
and the family viewing Lucy as a connection to their injured son.
In one particularly engaging scene around a boisterous dinner table,
WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING becomes more than its easily-summarized plot
point.</P>
<P>     It also boasts a winning performance by Sandra Bullock and an
impressive chemistry between Bullock and Bill Pullman.  With her
wholesome beauty and radiant smile, Bullock is perfectly cast as
Lucy.  It is not a particularly complex character, but Bullock has
real grace as a comic performer, an under-appreciated skill evident
in far too few current screen stars.  She has a solid and relaxed
partner in Pullman, who previously had seemed in danger of making a
career out of never getting the girl.  He does not have conventional
leading man looks, but there is an appealing self-deprecation in his
manner which could make him a natural romantic lead.  Their scenes
together are well-developed and steadily directed by Jon Turtletaub,
and they receive fine supporting help from Glynis Johns as the
Callaghans' quirky grandmother and the always-reliable Jack Warden
as a family friend who acts as Lucy's confidante.</P>
<P>     WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING loses a lot of its momentum once Peter
wakes up, however.  There are suggestions throughout the film that
he's going to turn out to be a truly narcissistic jerk, but we never
get a chance to see that character.  Peter Gallagher ends up playing
Peter as mostly befuddled, and not very interesting.  There is also
a throwaway sub-plot involving Peter's hell-on-wheels _real_
fiancee, who is not given a chance to do much of anything.  The
final twenty minutes of the film become mostly a waiting game until
Lucy and Jack end up together, and one that drags on a bit too long.
But it's what goes on while Peter is sleeping--a bright, charming
romance--that makes WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING a pleasant dream.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 SLEEPING beauties:  7.</PRE>
