<P>     IN THE COMPANY OF MEN is one of those rarest of rare breeds -- a 
movie that doesn't just ignore Hollywood conventions, but openly flouts 
them.  The film, which premiered to great critical acclaim at 1997's 
Sundance Film Festival, initially had trouble obtaining a U.S. 
distributor (for the record, Sony picked it up).  The reason is simple:  
because of its brutally-direct depiction of certain aspects of the 
current North American social climate, IN THE COMPANY OF MEN is anything 
but entertaining.  It's virtually impossible to sit through this film 
without suffering bouts of intense discomfort, and therein lies its 
power.</P>
<P>     The picture begins as something much different than what it 
concludes as, and the metamorphosis occurs so gradually that it only 
becomes apparent in retrospect.  Shortly after IN THE COMPANY OF MEN 
opens, the intent appears to be to center on the conflict between the 
sexes.  Ultimately, however, this only a small piece of the much larger 
pie into which Neil LaBute's directorial debut slices.  IN THE COMPANY 
OF MEN widens its focus to encompass the falseness and gamesmanship that 
underlies many aspects of everyday human interaction.  It's a cynical 
perspective that's all the more disturbing because it's grounded so 
deeply in reality.  The characters here aren't cardboard cut-out 
stereotypes -- they're the kind of people you can find anywhere inside 
or outside of the workplace.</P>
<P>     Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) are two very 
different guys with a great deal in common.  They attended the same 
college, work for the same corporation, and have a history of bad 
relationships with women.  Their combined romantic record reads like a 
litany of injustices perpetrated on them by females.  They have been 
duped, rejected, neglected, and intentionally misunderstood.  Chad, 
ready to go to war against the entire gender to "restore a little 
dignity", has a simple, vicious suggestion for revenge.  They will find 
a woman who has trouble getting dates, both take her out, then, after 
duping her into falling in love with one or both of them, they'll dump 
her at the same time.  Howard is initially reluctant, but Chad talks him 
into it before locating the perfect target:  an attractive-but-deaf 
typist named Christine (Stacy Edwards), whose disability has caused her 
self-esteem to erode.</P>
<P>     Have you ever seen anyone leap from the top of a skyscraper?  Or 
perhaps watched as two cars collide head-on?  The revulsion and horror 
are indescribable, but the compulsion to look is too great to ignore.  
No matter how deeply the experience tears at the soul, we can not avert 
our eyes.  It's a base reaction, but that's human nature.  Sitting 
through IN THE COMPANY OF MEN is a cleaner, more guilt-free experience, 
but it's not entirely dissimilar -- much as we dread viewing what must 
happen, we cannot tear ourselves away.  As painful as this film can be, 
it is never less than engrossing.</P>
<P>     The film doesn't follow a linear path; it evolves continually, 
which is untrue of many lesser motion pictures.  At the beginning, 
everything seems deceptively simple, but there are layers of complexity 
underlying each move.  As the story unfolds, it becomes difficult to 
discern a genuine action from a duplicitous one, and once-clear motives 
grow murky.  Slowly, however, the truth begins to assert itself, and, 
for those who really understand what drives these characters, the ending 
will be inevitable, not surprising.</P>
<P>     Much of LaBute's script is about manipulation and deceit, but he's 
smart enough to show the characters manipulating each other without 
turning that manipulation on the audience.  Nevertheless, because we 
become so involved in the interaction between these people, it's 
impossible for us not to be enflamed by what's transpiring, or to hope 
that justice comes from heaven in the form of a lightning bolt.  Part of 
us wants a deus ex machina resolution; however, LaBute's solution is 
more true, albeit less cathartic.  And, considering the overall impact 
of IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, it's hardly worth mentioning the 
writer/director's few rookie mistakes (static camera placement, 
occasionally stilted word choice).</P>
<P>     The lead actors, none of whom are well-known, give impressive 
performances.  Aaron Eckhart, who has slightly more camera time than his 
fellows, brings a surprising depth of humanity to the charming-but-
vengeful mastermind of the plan.  As Howard, Matt Malloy does a good job 
emphasizing his character's internal conflict.  The best member of the 
trio, however, is Stacy Edwards, who brings fire, passion, and fragility 
to Christine, and wins our hearts in the process.</P>
<P>     If you want every movie that you see to be SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, 
avoid IN THE COMPANY OF MEN.  This movie doesn't take prisoners, and 
"feel good" is a term no one will ever use to describe it.  But IN THE 
COMPANY OF MEN deserves high praise because what it does, it does 
extraordinarily well.  Finally, here's a film with the guts to tell this 
kind of the story without turning it into a fairy tale.  It's rare for 
any motion picture to generate such a profound sense of disquiet, but 
the path traversed by LaBute's characters is so bold that it's 
impossible not to be affected.</P>
