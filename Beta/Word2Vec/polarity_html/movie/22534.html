<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Sidney Goldin codirected Maurice Schwartz (Uncle Moses) in this film
from Schwartz's stage adaptation of Sholem Asch's 1918 novel. It was one
of the early Yiddish talkies to date and one of the most prestigious.
Schwartz was celebrated as being the 'Olivier of the Yiddish stage.'He
is one of the world's greatest actors (he was Tevye in Fiddler on the
Roof) but he is not as recognizable a name as he should be. This
comedy/romance that turns dramatic, should give you a good idea of how
great an actor he is. The film depicts the old-world values as it
clashes over the new-world dreams, and it is played out by seeing  the
traditional Jewish family undergo tremendous changes in their lifestyle,
as they must adapt to the ways of their new country.</P>
<P>The patriarchal Uncle Moses is the antihero rich clothing manufacturer
and twisted namesake of his Biblical counterpart. He left the East
Europe of Kuzmin, where he was a struggling butcher, and where there was
widespread poverty and persecution of the Jews, to come to America, the
promised land, and start his tailor business in the crowded Jewish
ghetto on the Lower East Side of NYC. As crude and as vile a man as he
is, the benevolent despot brought his landsman from the shtetl (Jewish
village) to America and got them jobs and took care of them. Their end
of the bargain, was that they worked in his sweatshop for 14-hours a
workday and they only received minimum wages, as he did not allow them
to belong to a union. For his end of the bargain, he treated them as
family, paid for treating their illnesses, acted as a benefactor for
them, and showed signs of generosity to them and those landsmen still
back in Kuzmin, giving freely to charity. He was Uncle Moses and the
workers accepted him as their patron and savior.</P>
<P>The first talking scene in the film indicates the complexity of the
Uncle Moses character, as a rabbi from his old shtetl visits his
clothing factory to solicit a donation. Moses is busy dealing with the
two women he had affairs with- the wife of a luncheonette owner and a
Polish shikse (gentile). The scene belies his ability at manipulation,
as the tricky boss and the rabbi with his hands out go after what they
both want from each other, as the rabbi amuses the patriarch by chanting
a Yom Kippur prayer, that brings out the nostalgia in Moses, who doesn't
let the rabbi forget for a moment who has the money and the power, as he
donates money to the synagagogue and to a cemetery in Kuzmin. Uncle
Moses enjoys his Moses role that he plays to his people, which teases
his vanity and his sentimental side. Though he is not a religious man,
he respects the traditions, as the film makes many Biblical allusions in
telling its story.</P>
<P>His nephew Sam (Gertler) runs the factory. He is Americanized,
preferring to speak in English and is disliked by the workers for being
a nasty tyrant. He follows his widowed uncle around, acting as his
flunky. His hope is that his childless uncle doesn't marry and that he
will inherit all his money.</P>
<P>Moses' father (Rubin Goldberg), plays the Shakespearian-like fool who
speaks the truth even if he appears as if he is crazy. He goes through
the factory chanting a catchy melody and bitterly denouncing his son in
a joking manner and denouncing the capitalistic system of his new
country, wishing to go back to the old country and be buried there. He
compares his son to Tsar Nicholas and to the Pharaoh. The father says
that he is the real Moses - that he will lead the Jewish workers in this
sweltering sweatshop out of bondage and take them to the sea.</P>
<P>One of Moses' workers pokes fun at his huge belly and is fired. The
cowardly worker (Schweid) brings his 17-year-old attractive daughter
Masha (Abarbanel) to beg Moses to give him his job back. When Moses
shows a romantic interest in the girl and is ready to do something for
her father, but his flunkies in the background encourage Moses to make
fun of her cowering father, she lashes out at him, calling him a beast,
a brute, and a dog! Moses likes the spirit she shows defending her
father and gives him back his old job at the machine and with a raise.
The much older Moses will woo the reluctant Masha for a year, showering
her family with gifts, shaving his beard and going to the gym to lose
weight for her sake. The parents will see this romance as an opportunity
to better their lot in life and push their daughter to accept his
marriage proposal, not caring one bit that she doesn't love him.
Meanwhile, Charlie (Zvee), the young Marxist follower who lives in her
tenement building, whom she is in love with, rails against her decision
to marry the wealthy boss. He will get involved with the union and start
organizing the workers.</P>
<P>The most memorable scene in the film, is the attempt to have a
traditional wedding ceremony, as the wedding takes place in his in-laws
fifth-floor walk-up apartment, where there is traditional song and
dancing, and a shot of the forlorn Charlie watching the wedding from his
apartment window that faces Masha's.</P>
<P>On the day that Masha gives birth to a son, the union strikes his shop,
and Moses is disappointed that his workers would go behind his back and
do this to him, telling them how much he did for them, though he is
still ready to sit down with them and work things out. But his in-law
insults Charlie and the strike takes place, as he turns his attention to
his baby and let's Sam handle the strike. Sam breaks up the strike by
using thugs, something Moses is repelled about and vows to never let
something like that happen again.</P>
<P>But Uncle Moses' way of life radically changes, as his wife can't find
satisfaction in the marriage, even though she tells him that she likes
him better than she does her parents. This all gets to Moses, who will
have a heart attack over the strike. He also agrees to divorce Masha. He
loses interest in running all his businesses and decides to make out a
will, leaving a quarter of his estate to the workers.</P>
<P>The times have changed for the immigrant Jews, as they had to choose
between two bad choices-the false family of the transposed shetl or the
emerging false family of the union. Moses becomes a symbol of the past,
as he is relegated to a sentimental and irrelevant role in the future.
The last shot in the movie is ultimately a sad one, of him coming back
to visit his family of workers, as he requests one of them to sing a
familiar nostalgic melody, and he proceeds to tell them a story of what
a man is, how a man builds houses, factories, brings his countrymen to
America, and after all, the grave awaits him.</P>
<P>The evils of American materialism is matched with a disdainful look at
the old-world economics and the old way of arranging marriages, of the
parents disregarding what their children want and acting as benovolent
tyrants over them. America is now a place for inspiration for the
younger generation, Yiddish will not be their first-tongue, and the rich
opportunities in the new land will take precedence over everything else.
Masha will be viewed as a victim, caught in the changing times, who did
not marry for money herself, but only to please her parents, an
obligation she believed that she had to fulfill. Moses will be looked
upon with mixed emotions, with some fond memories of him for his
charitable nature and some disappointments that he was an exploiter. He
will be viewed as a representative from a time when the immigrants were
in a transitional state in their new country, when they lived in poverty
and strived to have their children gain the fruits of the American
dream.</P>
