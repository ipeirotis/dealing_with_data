<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The Persian Gulf War of 1991 is put to celluloid and made into this
action-packed adventure story and intelligent political satire of the
once seemingly popular war, that would supposedly regain the American
sense of "feeling good" about itself that needed resurrection after the
Vietnam debacle. This was a war that made Americans proud of the
technology developed such as, smart bombs, and of how casualty free and
quickly the war was won, as it was watched on TV.</P>
<P>David O. Russell (Spanking the Monkey/Flirting With Disaster) sets his
contemporary story in Iraq during the immediate aftermath of the Gulf
War, as he lampoons the motives behind U.S. foreign policy, questioning
what President Bush's war really accomplished, even if it did succeed in
liberating Kuwait. He has made an unconventional but traditional
anti-war Hollywood movie, in the likes of films such as, Catch-22 and
M*A*S*H. This one has a potent bite to it, just like the others, but
maybe because it is filmed so soon after the bubble for American success
has busted, that it seems to have such a deliciously absurd bite to it.
With Saddam Hussein still in power, and the fact that there are military
personal still in harm's way over there at a great cost to this country,
as this country is stuck with the problem of making sure Saddam doesn't
rebuild his army with nuclear weapons. It makes one wonder who the
Americans really have helped with this war aside from some rich
Kuwaitis. What the film clearly shows, is that the bulk of the Iraqi
people, not the inner circle of the dictator, seem to be bearing the
brunt of the war's dire consequences.</P>
<P>The story begins as three army reservists called up to fight the war,
but not seeing any action, come upon a map of hidden gold bullions
stolen by Saddam Hussein from the Kuwaitis, stuffed up a prisoner's
crack in his butt and decide to go after the gold on their own. They
are: Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), who sees this as an opportunity
to provide his wife and infant back home with some financial security,
Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze-director of Being John Malkovich), a high school
drop-out who wants to be like Troy, so much so, that he would follow him
anywhere, and Staff Sgt. Chief Elgin (Ice Cube), someone who believes he
can put a magical circle of Jesus around himself and be protected from
any harm. Their plans change when a cynical veteran of the Special
Forces, Captain Archie Gates (George Clooney), who is about to retire
from the service, gets wind of what these men have found and takes
charge of the smelly situation, and the three become a quartet of
rogues.</P>
<P>These self-seeking fortune hunters, who have forgotten about their army
duty in favor of doing what's best for themselves, decide that they
should have the stolen gold instead of Saddam or Kuwait. They go out in
a stolen Humvee across the Iraqi desert to find the hidden bunker that
holds the gold, and they find the gold alright, but they also find Iraqi
rebels intent on rising up against Saddam. Saddam's army is busy putting
down the rebellion, an uprising in which President Bush is sending out
mixed messages, where on the one hand he tells the Iraqis to revolt and
America will help, but on the other hand he decides not to help them,
and does nothing to stop Saddam from killing those who were foolish
enough to believe the American president. This helps these rogues to
take advantage of the situation, as Saddam's loyalists look the other
way when they take the gold, and instead will focus solely on the
rebels.</P>
<P>The Americans escape with forty million in gold-as the Iraqi soldiers
let them go unharmed- but they get caught in a cross-fire between the
rebels and Saddam's soldiers, and the Americans wrestle with their
consciences, as Captain Gates, their philosophical leader, decides to
change his mind and to become altruistic and help the rebels get out of
harm's way, despite the problem it now leaves them with of escaping with
the gold, as Saddam's men start to go after them, and will capture Troy
in the shootout.</P>
<P>Troy is brought back to the bunker of Saddam's elite forces and is
tortured, as the Iraqi soldier (Saïd Taghmaoui) tells him that America
only fights for the oil and has done a tremendous amount of killing and
mutilation (including killing his child and crippling his wife) with its
bombing policy, and for him to believe that the Americans have come to
the aid of Kuwait for the sake of justice is laughable, if justice alone
was the reason for their help, then America would have to become
policeman for the world and would always be coming to the aid of
victimized countrys. He compares what his country did, in stealing the
gold, with what Troy and his group are now selfishly doing for
themselves.</P>
<P>The premise of the film is excellent; the story succeeds as both an
entertaining action film and as a searingly funny black comedy, it is
even effective as a valuable history lesson. There are plenty of odd
touches that give the film a fresh feel to it, such as, an exploding
cow, footballs that explode, a slow motion shot tracing the horrorific
damage a bullet does when it enters the body, as it shows that most
victims die from sepsis that results from a release of bile into the
bloodstream, and finally, to the scene of a rebel bunker full of stolen
Kuwaiti luxury cars being comically bartered to the Americans by the
rebel's chief officer.</P>
<P>The actors are brilliantly cast and make up for the lack of depth of
their characters by giving engaging performances: George Clooney is both
heroic and devilish, presenting a commanding stature for his
authoritative role. Wahlberg, as the naive all-American boy with a dark
side to him, serves the film well. Jonze is a real hoot and comes across
as the kind of dim soldier whom it is easy to feel sorry for and not get
too upset with him over his obvious mental defects. Ice Cube is solid.
Nora Dunn as Adrianna Cruz, a CNN-type of reporter, out for the hard
facts of the war, but given the run-around by the military brass,
captures the essence of this media war in all its gamesmanship. What
results is a brave film, one that has a surreal and trippy feel to it,
with some mortifying comedy dished out and some serious questions being
raised about a war that can't come to a proper conclusion anytime too
soon, as Russell explores a recent part of American history that
surprisingly hasn't been touched upon by other films, as of yet.</P>
<P>The war is covered with more personal detail than I got from watching it
on CNN. I feel that the filmmaker has caught the mood of most of the
soldiers, who don't understand the politics of the war and just want to
go home in one piece, of the career brass who are in it for promotions,
the media reporters who want to not only get the story but be the first
one to get it, and the politicians who can find a rational for whatever
they do. The film ultimately shows that anything is possible in the
amoral climate of a dictatorship and a consumer country out to protect
its own interest. The Three Kings turns out not to be a film about
wisemen, as a Biblical allusion, of which the title alludes to, but is
about four typical Americans who must make difficult choices that go
against their grain of nature. The reward for the audience, is seeing an
exciting film, with beautiful cinematography, in addition to seeing a
film that has a grave purpose to it and is funny in a serious way.</P>
