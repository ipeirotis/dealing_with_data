<P>     Everything I needed to know about the themes of THE BUTCHER BOY, it
turns out, I learned from the opening titles sequence.  The film's credits
are superimposed over comic book panels featuring scenes of angry faces
and destruction, the last of which fades into the story of a troubled
Irish teenager named Francie Brady (newcomer Eamonn Owens) circa 1961 -
1962.  It soon becomes clear that Francie is nobody's idea of a perfect
little boy, stealing apples and terrorizing more timid boys as his whim
moves him.  It also becomes clear that he comes from a dysfunctional home,
his emotionally unstable mother (Aisling O'Sullivan) spending almost as
much time in institutions as his drunken father (Stephen Rea) spends in
pubs.</P>
<P>     But it's not just family strife which eventually turns Francie into a
monster.  Every possible external influence sends Francie retreating into
a fantasy world of fear, paranoia and violence, particularly the
pernicious influence of the media.  Radio broadcasts of Cold War rhetoric
from President Kennedy create a general feeling that nuclear war is
imminent; television programs depict The Lone Ranger firing his gun and
The Fugitive seeking the elusive one-armed man; the era's popular mutant
horror movies fill theater screens; and, of course, the comic books
splashed over the opening credits feed boys still more violent images.
Even a priest at a Catholic reform school (Milo O'Shea) is a potential
threat as a fetishist and pedophile.  Is it any wonder Francie comes to
fixate on a single woman (Fiona Shaw) as the cause of all his troubles?
It is an era of scape-goating and fear-mongering, with poor young Francie
simply a product of his environment.</P>
<P>     There is a perverse fascination to watching Francie grow
progressively more demented, but eventually it becomes clear that there's
not much more to THE BUTCHER BOY than that.  It's tough to work up much
sympathy for Francie when he's treated by co-writer and director Neil
Jordan like a lab rat in a grand sociological experiment -- how much hate
and violence can one boy absorb until he snaps?  It can't help that the
lead character is an unstable boy played by an inexperienced young actor.
Though Owens has a few very effective moments, including worrying over the
lost affections of his one and only friend (Alan Boyle), he spends most of
the film mugging, yelling and gesticulating wildly.  For a story on a
serious subject, it's not always easy to take THE BUTCHER BOY seriously.</P>
<P>     Then again, it's pretty clear that Jordan isn't interested in having
us take it seriously.  THE BUTCHER BOY is a truly odd black-humored
concoction which treats Francie's many traumas with more whimsy than
consternation.  Virtually every moment is given a comic spin of some sort:
the simple comment of a townswoman that "it'll be a bitter day for this
town if the world comes to an end;" Frankie's conversations with a
decidedly earthy Virgin Mary (Sinead O'Connor); even electro-shock
treatments in "The Garage" (Francie's term for mental hospital, because
that's where you go when you break down).  Jordan's approach is
consistently surprising, taking even a tired device like omnipresent
voice-over narration (also provided by Rea as the adult Francie) and
turning it into a bizarre duet between past and present.  With Elliot
Goldenthal providing a jaunty underscore to everything from youthful play
to the discovery of a murder scene, THE BUTCHER BOY remains strangely
amusing enough to keep you watching.</P>
<P>     That, unfortunately, is about as far as Jordan goes.  As a comedy,
it's a fairly original collection of sick chuckles.  As a drama, it offers
pat answers and too little insight, putting us through episodic paces
without offering more to learn about its main character than we learned
from the first 90 seconds or so:  keep your boys away from television and
comic books unless you want them going crazy on you.</P>
<PRE>     On the Renshaw scale of 0 to 10 butcher chops:  6.</PRE>
