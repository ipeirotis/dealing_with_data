<P>     I can't help but wonder if THE SAINT was given the final go-ahead 
following the success of 1995's James Bond redux, GOLDENEYE.  This film, 
which plays very much like a low-key 007 yarn, began production in March 
1996, shortly after the Bond movie's domestic gross topped $100 million.  
Nevertheless, despite a few taut action sequences, some effective 
chemistry between the male and female leads, and a globetrotting 
storyline (the Far East to England to Russia), THE SAINT can't quite 
measure up to Pierce Brosnan's superspy debut.  The problem, however, is 
more one of history and mystique than plotting and acting.</P>
<P>     That's not to say that THE SAINT doesn't have a history of its own 
-- just that this movie doesn't have GOLDENEYE's cinematic pedigree.  In 
fact, the character of The Saint predates Bond by more than twenty-five 
years (in both written and film incarnations).  Author Leslie Charteris 
first introduced the world to his suave adventurer in 1926, and 
continued writing Saint stories until his death in 1993, compiling a 
list of more than 50 full-length titles and numerous shorter tales.  
During the late 1930s, RKO produced a series of Saint movies (several of 
which featured George Sanders in the lead).  Then, during the 1960s, THE 
SAINT came to television, with future James Bond Roger Moore in the 
title role.</P>
<P>     Now, some thirty years later, Val Kilmer has stepped into the shoes 
once occupied by Moore.  This '90s version of THE SAINT takes its 
inspiration in part from Charteris' books and in part from the TV series 
(including a few notes from Edwin Astley's theme song), but incorporates 
all the latest in technology.  While Kilmer's Simon Templar is a master 
of disguises, he's also armed with an impressive array of miniature 
computers and other assorted gadgets.  He logs onto the Internet at 
will, reads video e-mail, and remotely monitors his swelling Swiss bank 
account.</P>
<P>     THE SAINT purports to tell the origins of the title character, 
something that Charteris never wrote about.  Following a brief prologue 
in a Far East orphanage, where a young Templar's path in life is set, 
the scene shifts to Moscow in the near future.  A former communist 
leader-turned-billionaire capitalist, Ivan Tretiak (Rade Serbedzija), is 
about to make a power play for Russia's leadership.  In order to do so, 
he hires master thief Templar to steal the secret of cold fusion from 
Emma Russell (Elisabeth Shue), the Oxford scientist who developed the 
formula.  With a $3 million paycheck awaiting him, Templar makes contact 
with Emma, but, much to his chagrin, he becomes entranced by her 
combination of beauty and innocence, and discovers that stealing her 
notes and breaking her heart is more difficult than he had anticipated.</P>
<P>     THE SAINT is more of a character-based thriller than a strict 
stunts-and-explosions film, which is a good thing because the action 
sequences are mostly flat and obligatory.  Even when he generates a 
degree of tension, director Phillip Noyce (PATRIOT GAMES, CLEAR AND 
PRESENT DANGER) is unable to sustain it, and the disappointing ending is 
not only long and drawn out, but lacks a sense of closure.  It's nice to 
set up a movie for a sequel, but THE SAINT concludes in such a way that 
the story seems somehow incomplete.</P>
<P>     Acting and character development lie at THE SAINT's core.  While 
Val Kilmer's taciturn Templar may remind viewers of his interpretation 
of Bruce Wayne, the actor is at his best when donning one of about a 
dozen disguises.  Elisabeth Shue's Emma, on the other hand, only has one 
personality, and it's a wonderfully-realized one.  She's a dreamer and a 
romantic who has little experience with men or real life.  She's smart, 
energetic, and extremely vulnerable, and the film's strongest dynamic 
results from what happens when Templar attempts to tap into her 
weaknesses and, in the process, finds his own exposed.  </P>
<P>     Other than Kilmer and Shue, the only actors with much screen time 
are Valery Nikolaev and veteran Rade Serbedzija.  Serbedzija, who is 
known internationally following his appearances in films such as BEFORE 
THE RAIN and BROKEN ENGLISH, plays a fairly standard megalomaniac here.  
He gets to shout lines like "I want to see Russia not cut off at the 
knees, but armed to the teeth!"  As Tretiak's son, Nikolaev, a 
relatively new face in the West, has the rather thankless role of the 
bloodthirsty, revenge-driven sidekick.  Henry Goodman is a physicist 
trying to make sense out of cold fusion and Irina Apeximova is a black 
market operator who sells secrets to Templar.</P>
<P>      The location work is noteworthy.  The scenes filmed outside of the 
Kremlin have an eerie sense of verisimilitude (Russian director Nikita 
Mikhalkov, whose BURNT BY THE SUN won an Oscar in 1995, helped make the 
arrangements that allowed Noyce to film in Red Square).  And, while THE 
SAINT stops short of being a travelogue of Moscow, it does offer a 
number of fascinating glimpses into one of Russia's most historic 
cities.</P>
<P>     Anyone expecting anything remarkable or new about THE SAINT will be 
disappointed.  Simon Templar's latest adventure is fairly standard 
material, although it is brought to the screen with a certain degree of 
style.  Paramount has wisely decided to release the film before the 
summer blockbuster season.  In April, THE SAINT will have more of a 
chance to find an audience than it would ever have during warmer months.  
Big box office returns would still surprise me, however.  THE SAINT is 
lightly entertaining, but there's very little here worth getting excited 
about.</P>
