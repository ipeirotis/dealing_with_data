<P>    -------------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>   Like its own opening shot, from out of the darkness BOOGIE NIGHTS
   triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and
   clarity, persuasively heralding its helmer Paul Thomas Anderson as a
   bonafide major talent.  A sprawling epic set in the heart of the
   disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in
   the adult film industry, BOOGIE NIGHTS is an astonishingly ambitious
   feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly
   entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of
   filmmaking.</P>
<P>   The film follows a soft-spoken young man, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg)
   from Torrance, through his induction into the erotic picture business
   to stardom, and later, to a harrowingly precipitous drop.  As BOOGIE
   NIGHTS opens, he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy San Fernando
   Valley nightclub, and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical
   mother who denigrates him at every opportunity.  Recruited by
   fatherly Jack Horner (a rejuvenated Burt Reynolds), a successful porn
   filmmaker, Eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as Dirk
   Diggler, pornstar.  Wholeheartedly embraced by Jack's troupe,
   including the maternal Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), Reed Rothchild
   (John C. Reilly), Buck Swope (Don Cheadle), Rollergirl (Heather
   Graham), Dirk and his "one special thing" are quickly propelled to
   the top of his field, fulfilling his mantra of being a "big bright
   shining star".  His lack of discipline, however, incites a chain of
   circumstances which sees Dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade
   is ushered in.</P>
<P>   The element of BOOGIE NIGHTS which literally commands attention is
   the bravura direction by Mr. Anderson, whose fascination and prowess
   with the camera is obvious.  From the terrific tracking shot
   throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the
   players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female
   partygoer diving into a pool, Mr. Anderson's accomplished command of
   the camera is without question.  While novice directors often
   demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant
   camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating, impertinent and
   self-congratulatory (case in point: Marc Rocco's unforgettable
   perpetual-motion helming of MURDER IN THE FIRST), in BOOGIE NIGHTS
   every zoom or pan by Mr. Anderson, be it slow and deliberate or
   energetically sharp, is purposeful and potent.  It's a rarity and a
   delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a
   filmmaker's career -- BOOGIE NIGHTS is only his second feature film,
   following up his debut feature from earlier this year, HARD EIGHT --
   and although it's somewhat derivative (his storytelling style is
   reminiscent of Robert Altman, while in terms of visuals he's clearly
   influenced by Martin Scorsese), at least he's borrowing from some of
   the best, and it's entirely effective within the context of this
   film.</P>
<P>   While BOOGIE NIGHTS is astonishingly polished from a technical
   perspective, in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also
   rollicking good fun, with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour.  The
   film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of
   music, clothes, hairstyles, dance, idioms, and culture, aided
   immeasurably by impeccable production design by Bob Ziembicki and
   costume design by Mark Bridges, and BOOGIE NIGHTS convincingly
   catapults the audience back to this recent, pre-AIDS-scare period in
   American history where uninhibited, free-wheeling lifestyles
   abounded.  While much of the film's humour pertains to the
   characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then
   prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman Buck
   Swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape, and
   inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music
   -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule, but of wistful
   reminiscence, and some the throwback elements in the film are
   strangely wondrous.  A giant ensemble disco dance production number
   in a nightclub is funny, to be sure, but oddly magical, and the
   sequence which lovingly explores Eddie/Dirk's bedroom, completely
   adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures (Farrah
   Fawcett, Cheryl Tiegs, Bruce Lee) is breathtaking.  Ably supported by
   a well-selected collection of period music (all of which purportedly
   came straight from Mr. Anderson's personal collection), there's a
   clear affection for the era in BOOGIE NIGHTS.</P>
<P>   It's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of BOOGIE
   NIGHTS which has been played up in its marketing campaign in
   deference of the pornography element of the storyline; the film's
   promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the
   adult film industry which unites its characters.  After the debacle
   with 1996's Milos Forman film, THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT, another
   finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due
   to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline, the New
   Line marketing team faced a unique challenge with BOOGIE NIGHTS in
   terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic
   picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the
   general public.</P>
<P>   However, while BOOGIE NIGHTS delves into the world of the adult film
   industry of two decades ago, it's hardly a lurid or seamy film --
   given the subject matter, there's very little nudity, and virtually
   none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and BOOGIE NIGHTS
   smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality, but
   simply as a business.  The glimpses on the sets of Jack Horner's
   shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to
   titillate, there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex; his
   cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job, and it's
   refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery
   often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking, such as
   coercion or debauchery, are avoided.</P>
<P>   If anything, BOOGIE NIGHTS is more interested in the process of adult
   filmmaking than the adult films themselves.  Jack Horner's dream is
   an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and
   to some degree BOOGIE NIGHTS is reminiscent of ED WOOD (albeit
   lacking a certain wistful innocence).  In both films, the world of
   quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored, and both Jack Horner and
   the version of Ed Wood by Tim Burton, Scott Alexander, and Larry
   Karaszewski share similar mindsets -- Jack's retort of "There are
   shadows in light, baby" to his cinematographer's complaint about poor
   set lighting echoes back to Ed Wood's "It's not about the little
   details, it's about the big picture!" rant when it is pointed out
   that his graveyard set for PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE appears patently
   false.  In BOOGIE NIGHTS and ED WOOD, the aspirations of the
   respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing, not in their intentions
   -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an
   'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the
   mark.  Much like the humour lacing ED WOOD, the laughs involving Jack
   Horner are double-edged; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one
   of his latest films which hybridizes the James Bond and porn genres,
   when Jack breathes "This is the best work I've ever done", it's
   genuinely funny, but given his utter sincerity, also possesses a
   tinge of sadness.</P>
<P>   Mr. Anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director
   than a screenwriter.  While BOOGIE NIGHTS shows great inventiveness
   in staging, there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film,
   though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's
   characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal
   exchanges; when one considers that the film's *protagonist* literally
   doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152
   minute running time, it's no wonder why the playfully inane "How much
   can you bench?" banter between Dirk and Reed constitutes one of the
   film's finest exchanges.  And while Mr. Anderson creates a rich
   collection of fascinating characters, it's problematic that some of
   the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale
   material -- Julianne Moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched
   stuff, better suited for a less risque and uninspired TV-movie
   version of her character's story, and far less interesting than the
   thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions.
   Still, even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters,
   Mr. Anderson most definitely captures their essences, and his
   resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious --
   misguided, even aimless, hopelessly naive, self-destructive,
   insufferable: I loved them just the same.</P>
<P>   In any case, it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains
   one of the most audacious and inspired (and ultimately best-executed)
   scenes of the year: a scene where Dirk Diggler and Reed Rothchild are
   dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug
   baron Rahad Jackson (a mesmerizing Alfred Molina in an unforgettable
   performance, even if it's a small one) in a suicidal drug deal scam,
   only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric (the part
   where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of Night Ranger's
   "Sister Christian" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance) flanked
   by an armed bodyguard.  If this scene already wasn't tense enough
   with these elements, Mr. Anderson introduces a Chinese boy that
   wanders through the scene, who for no discernable reason is tossing
   firecrackers around the room, pushing the scene to a new, surreal
   level of delightful giddiness.</P>
<P>   There are some other interesting touches in BOOGIE NIGHTS.  Mr.
   Anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack
   from HARD EIGHT; here, it accompanies the violent intercut sequences
   which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening
   effect.  Similarly, a painful scene where crew member Scotty J
   (Philip Seymour Hoffman) breaks down in tears in the driver's seat,
   sobbing "I'm so stupid" after being rebuffed by Dirk after an awkward
   but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later
   scene with Dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous
   and traumatic evening.</P>
<P>   BOOGIE NIGHTS is exceedingly well cast, and each of the actors rise
   to the occasion; the ensemble cast is uniformly good.  While most of
   the acting accolades will no doubt go to Mr. Wahlberg (fulfilling
   upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier
   films) and Mr. Reynolds (terrific as the father figure and stable
   anchor of the film, ringing true in every respect), a handful of
   other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention.</P>
<P>   Mr. Reilly demonstrates here, as he did for brief glimpses in Ulu
   Grosbard's GEORGIA, a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his
   scenes in BOOGIE NIGHTS are among the very funniest in the film.
   I'm not sure how much of his performance as Reed was scripted and how
   much was done on the spot, but he plays the quintessential second
   banana character to a tee.  Mr. Reilly is the best part of the big
   disco dance production number, and it's wickedly funny to watch his
   Reed join in with Dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on
   the block during a macho altercation.  Worth the price of admission
   alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio
   while the Dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad (and
   dead-on period; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me) demo track
   "You Got The Touch" in a vain attempt at a musical career.  Mr.
   Reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is
   convincing and effective.</P>
<P>   Ms. Graham, with her long dirty blonde hair, innocent demeanour, and
   huge hazel eyes, looks like a Disney animated heroine come to life
   -- or in this case, a Disney animated heroine who came to life, made
   a wrong turn, and ended up on the New Line lot in a film focused on
   the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry.  Consequently, it's a
   bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about
   the set on her roller skates, but in a scene where she's lounging in
   a limousine prowling the streets, garish red lipstick messily smeared
   on, giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look, all one
   can do is gulp.  Her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out
   (err -- in a figurative sense) -- she's essentially a glorified extra
   -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is
   unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity.  (If only Mr. Anderson had
   filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage
   and anguish on her face, though!)  And a cautionary tale for the
   strict and prudish: as a teen, Ms. Graham's parents forbade her to
   take a part in the twisted cult classic HEATHERS; since then, her
   most notable roles have been as a junkie (Gus Van Sant's DRUGSTORE
   COWBOY) and now a porn starlet.  Draw your own conclusions.</P>
<P>   Perhaps the most quietly touching performance in BOOGIE NIGHTS is
   that of Mr. Cheadle, who lends dignity to his role as a character in
   search of his identity, and whose quest is comically manifested by a
   series of changes in his sense of fashion.  His relationship with his
   cheerfully supportive new wife Jessie St. Vincent (an interesting
   Melora Walters) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness, and
   although his general longing for acceptance from others is
   perceptible, it's no more so than in the bank scene where his loan
   application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background
   in the porn industry.  While the scenario is familiar, the wounded
   look in Cheadle's eyes makes the scene unforgettable.</P>
<P>   Luis Guzman's most famous work is possibly in Brian De Palma's
   CARLITO'S WAY, and here he plays a variation on the same character:
   Maurice T. Rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner
   who's a hanger-on to Jack's group, ingratiating himself into the
   clique and constantly hounding Jack, with little disguise made of his
   desperation, for a part in one of his erotic pictures.  Jack's
   eventual acquiescence to Maurice's request leads to one of BOOGIE
   NIGHTS' biggest comic payoffs.</P>
<P>   BOOGIE NIGHTS is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction
   by Mr. Anderson, who immediately asserts his presence in the film
   industry as a presence of note with this work.  Striking a fine
   balance between humour and drama, and exceptionally well-crafted,
   there's no doubt that BOOGIE NIGHTS is among the very best films of
   the year.</P>
