<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>Inspired by the maverick Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki's 1987 "Hamlet
Goes Business," Michael Almereyda (Another Girl, Another Planet/Nadja)
directs this updated mainstream, mock serious version of Hamlet with
great wit, style, and immediacy. He effortlessly transfers locations
from Denmark to the New York City of 2000, which shows how malleable
Hamlet is and how right it seems to take it away from its staginess and
sole reliance on dialogue instead of making it a more cinematic
experience. Denmark is changed from being a country to the name of the
multinational corporation that must endure the slings and arrows from
the pen of William Shakespeare. But what Almereyda fails to do in this
slenderized (no gravediggers here) version of Hamlet, is make his modern
visuals jive with the staginess of the bard's words, therefore the film
always felt jarring. Even in some very beautifully mannered scenes,
there was a note of clumsiness, indicating something was missing or
didn't match about this far-reaching production that bordered on mawkish
giddiness, though not quite falling down that hole. The old style
English dialogue and the new visuals did not make for a coherent film,
with the visuals being spectacular and relevant, while the dialogue
seemed to be from another planet, or from another venue.
I thought I would never say that Shakespeare's Hamlet is better visually
than its dialogue, but in this film version, that is clearly the case.</P>
<P>By not changing the tone of the Shakespearian dialogue to the
neurotically nasal everyday speech of the modern New Yorker, while
radically altering the visual effects to fit in with the current times,
the film developed a split-personality, which it was never able to
recover from. If you are going to change things, why make half the film
conform to traditional Shakespeare, when you could have taken a further
risk and made the entire film a glittering display of inventiveness, and
perhaps achieve a major breakthrough in how to present Hamlet to a
modern audience!</P>
<P>This Hamlet tale concerns the machinations of a power struggle in the
corporate world and about a young man named Hamlet (Ethan Hawke),
shocked that his mother Gertrude (Diane Venora) would marry her
husband's brother Claudius (Kyle MacLachlan), so soon after his death. A
death that Hamlet suspects was accomplished by Claudius and confirmed
when he chats with his father's ghost (Sam Shepard), who is first seen
on a security guard's monitor.</P>
<P>Instead of the castle at Elsinore, we have the Hotel Elsinore as the
business headquarters for the Denmark Corporation, which is located in
the heart of Manhattan's sleek tinted-glass world of offices. Hamlet is
a troubled soul who is a struggling digital videomaker, with fits of
self-importance and bouts of illusionary grandeur. All his woes are in
his head and he can't get the ghost of his father out of his mind.</P>
<P>Hamlet makes a fashion statement by wearing a woolen Scandinavian type
ski hat with flaps hanging down the sides, something the kids in NYC's
ghetto popularized in the 1980s
when their dress code had an attitude. Hamlet has such a grungy
attitude.</P>
<P>To get a rise out his stepfather, Hamlet makes a video called "The
Mousetrap" and succeeds in getting his ire by showing it to him along
with invited guests, in what appears to be the Guggenheim. The video is
a comically haphazard avant-garde work by the animator Lewis Klahr,
showing a variety of historical film footage.</P>
<P>Hamlet's girl is the teenager Ophelia (Julia Stiles), who lives in an
artist's loft and suffers from peevishness. She is annoyed by Hamlet's
amorous advances, not knowing what to make of them, and she is also
annoyed by her overbearing father Polonius (Bill Murray) who lectures
her, and her big brother Laertes (Liev Schreiber) who coddles her in a
brotherly fashion, as both men seek to control her. Hamlet and Ophelia
are a perfectly beautiful looking but obnoxious couple, who are plagued
by the modern problem of lack of communication. Hawke is a bland but
effective Hamlet, Stiles is a childish and limited Ophelia, Murray is a
deliciously hammy Polonius, MacLachlan is a transparently ruthless CEO,
Diane Venora is a physically manipulative Gertrude, whose performance
brings out both a mother's anguish for her son and her lust for her
husband, Schreiber is simply brilliant as an affecting Laertes, playing
his part more in the traditional Shakespearian mode, Sam Shepard makes
for a hell of a forceful ghost, while Steve Zahn is a sleazy Rosencrantz
and Dechen Thurman (a relative of Hawke's) is his sleazy counterpart
Guildenstern.</P>
<P>It is difficult to take this Hamlet in quite the same serious way it is
usually presented
onstage, and that's just fine. Refreshingly, this film does not have one
ounce of pretention  to high culture. The cast all come with their own
individual ideas about the characters they are playing and offer their
odd renditions for the traditional roles. Ophelia receives the news from
Hamlet that she should "get thee to a nunnery" via a bevy of telephone
answering messages. Hawke delivers his "To be or not to be" soliloquy in
the action video section of a Blockbuster store. He prepared his first
soliloquy about his father's death on his laptop computer, as the ghost
of his father is reported seen by the amiable Horatio (Geary).</P>
<P>The story, though almost cut in half, still is basically the same. But
the dramatic effect is different. You have to lose something when you
throw away all that Shakespeare dialogue. In some scenes we look through
all the egotism of the characters through glass that is crystal clear
and easy to shatter, and the effect is a sharpened sense of what we are
seeing. But when the final tragedy unfolds, there is no real emotion in
it, the film failed to pull us into that scene. It seemed as if the soul
had been taken out of it. And that is the major fault of the film.</P>
<P>What lingers, is a strong sense that we are steeped in a Hamlet who must
be viewed with urgency, a sense of foreboding gloom, and with a sense of
ticklish glibness. The picture was shot in super 16 millimeter. Its NYC
face is given a glossy, bluish and grayish tint, catching all the limos,
glass closets, and glass high-rise structures John de Borman could film
with his superlative camerawork. He nearly transforms this into a
neo-noir film on his own terms. NYC never looked more like a glistening
Denmark or a glass house, while "Hamlet" looks more like a work of
visual poetry instead of sounding like great literature. An interesting
concept, too bad Almereyda couldn't completely pull it off. Yet I
applaud the chances he took and all the misses never completely deterred
me from enjoying the film. It came awfully close to being camp, but the
oddness of this unlikely cast playing Shakespeare, somehow, held the
film together and made it accessible to an audience that Shakespeare
might not have reached before. I actually missed Bill Murray when he
departed the film after Hamlet accidently plugs him while he's in the
closet. Even though Hawke's Hamlet had the edge of a young man's
immaturity and impetuousness, what would have really given this film a
sense of manic self-consciousness, would have been to cast Sean Penn as
Hamlet, though James Dean in that part would have been the ultimate coup
de grace.</P>
