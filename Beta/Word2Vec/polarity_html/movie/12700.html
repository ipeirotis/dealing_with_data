<P>     What would happen, I wonder, if Frank Capra was still alive and 
making films today?  Would his unique blend of feel-good optimism and 
old-fashioned values be accepted by jaded movie-going audiences that 
increasingly seem to suffer from attention deficit syndrome?  Or, can 
Capra only be appreciated today in black-and-white, as a reminder of 
what films used to be during "simpler times?"  Of course, there's the 
other side of the coin to consider, as well -- a film trying to 
recapture Capra's style could easily end up going over-the-top into 
saccharine melodrama.  </P>
<P>     HEARTWOOD, an independent production from the Cotler Brothers 
(Steve produced, Lanny directed, and both shared writing chores), 
attempts, with limited success, to invoke Capra's memory.  The ending, 
with its obvious nod to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, mines a vein of goodwill 
and uplifting sentiment, and, as a result, may seem a little corny and 
behind-the-times to all but the most uncynical of viewers.  Perhaps part 
of the reason is that, in today's "me-first" world, it doesn't seem 
reasonable that people would willingly hand over their life's savings to 
preserve a community and a way of life.  So the Cotlers have taken a 
risk in making this sort of movie in 1998.  HEARTWOOD assuredly has an 
audience out there somewhere; the difficulty for the Cotlers, who are 
distributing it themselves, is finding it.</P>
<P>     Ultimately, the risk might have paid off more handsomely had there 
not been several obvious production problems.  HEARTWOOD, although 
rooted in the soil of good intentions, is flawed.  The film is basically 
a modern day fairy tale with a happy ending, and, for a movie like this 
to be entirely successful, it must be crafted with great care and 
attention to detail.  HEARTWOOD suffers from sketchily-developed 
characters that seem real and believable only about half the time.  
Worse still, several key scenes are undermined by uneven acting.</P>
<P>     The plot of HEARTWOOD combines three different elements into one 
story.  The first, and least-inspired, is a fairly traditional boy-
meets-girl romance.  The second focuses on a young man trying to find a 
sense of self-worth.  The third, and most consistently interesting, 
deals with the struggles of a saw mill owner to balance environmental 
concerns with his desperate need for money.  HEARTWOOD's intelligent, 
non-preachy approach to the ecological disaster befalling California's 
redwood forest earned it a citation from SAVE AMERICA'S TREES, a forest 
preservation society.  The Cotlers express this aspect of their film 
subtly, by making the forest a strong presence -- almost to the point 
where it functions as a supporting character.</P>
<P>     HEARTWOOD takes place in the small California town of Deroy 
(population between 200 and 300), where everyone is employed by the 
local saw mill, which is owned by the grizzled, life-weary Logan Reeser 
(Jason Robards).  Logan's refusal to rape the forests for quick 
financial gain has put him deep in debt, and he's in danger of losing 
the mill to the banks.  Coming to his rescue is an unlikely candidate -- 
Frank (Eddie Mills), Deroy's resident slacker, a jobless college-age 
young man who spends all day roaming the forests and hunting small 
animals.  After finding a gold nugget in a riverbed, he has a brainstorm 
that might prove to be Logan's salvation.  Meanwhile, Frank has fallen 
in love with a visiting college student, Sylvia (Hilary Swank), who is 
also the local hotshot's object of affection.  Bolstered by confidence 
gained from finding the nugget, Frank sets out to win her while 
impressing her parents and saving the mill.</P>
<P>     Aspects of HEARTWOOD work exceptionally well.  The cinematography 
is glorious, running a close second to THE HORSE WHISPERER for the most 
stunning views of sunrises and sunsets to come across the screen this 
year.  The film also offers insight into the fascinating workings of a 
community whose entire existence is entwined with the success of a saw 
mill.  I especially liked one character's rationalization for cutting 
down trees:  "It's survival of the fittest."  (That hardly seems fair, 
since the only way a tree can fight back is to fall on you.)  There are 
also a number of effectively-realized character moments, such as one 
where Frank offers to brush Sylvia's hair as they share a quiet moment. </P>
<P>     Unfortunately, there are instances when the plot's preposterous 
turns are highlighted (rather than camouflaged) by the overwrought 
performances of the two leads.  Eddie Mills and Hilary Swank (THE NEW 
KARATE KID) are fine when they're not required to depict powerful 
emotions, but, on those occasions when the script demands passion, 
tears, rage, or some equally heartfelt display, their performances 
become awkward and unconvincing, and this hurts HEARTWOOD's 
believability.  Several of the other actors, including Jason Robards, 
John Terry, and especially Denise Dummont (who stands out despite 
limited screen time), are quite good, but their effective portrayals are 
overshadowed by the unevenness exhibited by Mills and Swank.</P>
<P>     In many ways, HEARTWOOD reminded me of 1996's THE SPITFIRE GRILL.  
Although I think the Cotlers' film is somewhat less manipulative and 
true-to-itself, there are similarities in tone and intent.  HEARTWOOD's 
great strength is its ability to fold an intelligent message seamlessly 
into the story; its weakness is that the narrative is hurt, rather than 
helped, by the performances.  It's possible to appreciate this kind of 
film for the way it recalls Capra's spirit; it's just not strong enough 
to evade the labels of "melodramatic" and "corny."</P>
