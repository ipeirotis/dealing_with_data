<P>PLOT:
A young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in London
and quickly becomes a staple by his side. But this new guy is not like all the
others, he's got ambition, he's got goals and he loves everything he sees about
being the number one gangster. Violence, lots of swearing and betrayals ensue.</P>
<P>CRITIQUE:
A very good, serious-minded, unique British gangster flick which misses the
"great" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and
a so-so ending. Here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to
bring something new into the mix. Okay, so it's not entirely new, but it's
definitely original when all put together as done here. The thing I liked most
about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was
taking place. It's 1968 and these dudes are looking good! Yes, it's all about
the suits, fellas...the Italian shoes, the cufflinks, the ties and the birds
(that's ladies, for those uninitiated) hanging around you. Here are a bunch of
horrible men, gangsters if you will, looking sharp, talking shit and busting
heads all over the place. But that's not the basis of this movie. The basis of
this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the
group, the excellent David Thewlis, and one of his cronies, Paul Bettany, also
extremely good in this film, and how the power, sex appeal and coolness of one,
affects the other.</P>
<P>You know how there are always these "hanger-on" gangster types who latch on to
the godfathers, the leaders, the top dogs of every crime organization? Well,
most of the time, these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one
person...that is, their boss. So all the gangster number one needs to worry
about is his enemies on the other side of the fence. But this film brings the
betrayals, the messed up loyalties, the honor codes among bad guys into play
within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package. Of course,
director Paul McGuigan isn't trying to be Guy Ritchie here, and doesn't
over-stylize his presentation, jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any
humor to the mix. Nope, he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at
least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as I type this.
The first is a confrontation sequence between Bettany and a man from which he's
attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty! ("Look into my
eyes!") In fact, the last time that I've seen a guy so scared in a movie was
John Turturro in that forest scene from the Coen brothers' MILLER'S CROSSING.
Scary shite. But there's an ever better scene than that in this film. This one
features Bettany, once again, slowly torturing, hacking and beating the living
piss out of a rival gangster (from that man's point-of-view), but not before
turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own
expensive clothes, one by one (that's right, he "does" the guy in his
underwear). That scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and
homoerotic undertones present throughout this film, especially in the
relationship between Bettany and his boss (why does he get so upset when he
falls in love with that woman?).</P>
<P>But the flick's not perfect. In fact, I didn't mind Malcolm McDowell's
voice-over narration at first, but as the film grew into a major flashback (most
of the film is presented as such), he came in every now and then, and rarely
added anything of interest to the plot. All he seemed to do was swear and call
people the c-word umpteen times, and even described one scene as it was
happening ("...so I opened the door, then went up the lift, etc...."-it's like,
yeah, I know that already, I could see it on the screen!! Overdone.). I also
didn't quite "buy" the ending of the movie, which despite being original, seemed
a little unbelievable, especially when you consider that it's supposed to be
taking place 30 years later, and folks still seem to be holding grudges, still
in love, still living in the same apartments??!? I mean, c'mon...it's 30 years,
man!! I don't know, somehow it didn't work all that well for me. But one of my
favorite genres has always been the crime movies, and this one is a decent
addition to the lot. Forget the lame title and Malcolm McDowell's narration of
the obvious plot points, and concentrate on the film's stronger attributes such
as its style, the exquisite atmosphere of the time period, its original look at
the gangster dynamic within the same group, its memorable sequences and the
solid performances from its two main leads, Bettany and Thewlis. Incidentally,
unlike a few of the gangster flicks that I mention below, this one is in no way
a parody or homage to this genre of films...it's the real deal!</P>
<P>Note: This film is packed with strong accents all around, which makes it hard to
make out some of the words from time to time. It's also quite violent and I
don't remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one, so leave the
kids at home for this one... ;)</P>
