<PRE>MY DOG SKIP
A film review by Steve Rhodes
Copyright 2000 Steve Rhodes
RATING (0 TO ****):  *** 1/2</PRE>
<P>How about this for a concept? An autobiographical story about a boy and
his dog that doesn't have any special effects, no talking animals and no
promotional toy tie-ins.  Jay Russell's MY DOG SKIP is just a good,
old-fashioned, heart-warming story that is so genuine and touching that
it should appeal to people of all ages, even those with no kids.</P>
<P>"My fondest memories are of my childhood days back in Yazoo,
Mississippi," Willie Morris explains to us in voice-over in the
introduction.  Set during the summer of 1942, as WW II rages, the story
concerns 9-year-old Willie (Frankie Muniz from "Malcolm in the Middle"),
a scrawny kid with a small mouth and beady eyes, who gets picked on by
the local bullies.</P>
<P>On his birthday, Willie receives Skip, a precious, terrier puppy, as a
gift from his mother (Diane Lane), but his father (Kevin Bacon) doesn't
approve.  His father lost his leg in the Spanish Civil war.  He's a good
dad but a cautious one, who appears to still be suffering from unspoken
war wounds.</P>
<P>The sweetest little dog imaginable, Skip is a lovable pup who's full of
energy.  The director finds lots of adorable things for the canine to do
without ever letting the story turn schmaltzy.  Typical of the inspired
staging is the delightful, time-lapse visual of Skip as he is growing up
until he is finally big enough to jump up and drink from the family's
white porcelain toilet bowl.</P>
<P>"The dog of your boyhood teaches you a great deal," Willie tells us of
Skip.  "You could talk to him better than you could talk to most human
beings."  Skip is truly Willie's best friend, the most loyal of loyal
companions.</P>
<P>"Like all dogs, Skip was color blind," Willie says of the dog's
companionship with races on both sides of the track in the typically
segregated, Southern town.  The movie is filled with touching subplots
from one about racism to one about the disgraced town hero, Dink Jenkins
(Luke Wilson).  Dink, a star high-school athlete, worshiped by the
locals, especially the young boys, is emotionally scarred by the war.</P>
<P>The movie is filled with wonderfully poetic narration by Harry Connick,
Jr., as the voice of the adult Willie.  "Why in childhood and youth do
we wish time to pass quickly, and as an adult we wish just the
opposite?" he asks.  "All the lessons you learn in childhood kind of
come in waves," he tells us.  And this was the summer that Willie
learned quite a few.  Many of the episodes are quite humorous, and all
are honest and genuine.</P>
<P>The warmly nostalgic picture is filmed in radiantly inviting colors and
filled with richly evocative music.</P>
<P>As a viewer, you will vicariously get to enjoy Skip's friendship.  And
if you find yourself both applauding and crying during the picture, as I
did, don't be surprised.  Actually, if you don't cry, you'll probably
want to get a check-up.</P>
<P>The film joyously reminds us all of just how wonderful life can be.  The
good-spirited picture will likely bring back many fond memories of your
childhood.  I too had a terrier, although mine was half cocker spaniel.
Willie describes himself as an only child with an only dog, which was
exactly my situation as well.  There are other similarities, but I can't
mention them without giving away key plot points.  I relived my
childhood while watching the film.  What more could you ask for?</P>
<P>MY DOG SKIP runs 1:35.  It is rated PG for some violent content and mild
language.  The film would be fine for all ages, including people without
kids at all.  Be warned, however, that some of the tragedies in the
picture may briefly frighten impressionable kids under around 8.</P>
<P>My son Jeffrey, age 10, absolutely adored the movie.  He gave it ****
and said that it should win an Oscar.  He liked everything about the
movie, and he loved Skip.  Jeffrey's buddy Nickolas, age 10, gave the
picture ***, saying it was funny and had a good plot.  And, of course,
he too thought Skip was terrific.</P>
