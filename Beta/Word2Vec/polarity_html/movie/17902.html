CHAIN LETTERS (director: Mark Rappaport; cast: Mark Arnott (Paul), Reed
Birney (Greg), David Brisbin (Phil), Randy Danson (Beth), Marilyn Jones
(Tracy),Ellen McElduff (Eva), Joan MacIntosh (Evelyn), Dan Davis
(Steve), Robert Schenkkan (Rick),1985)</P>
<P>A chain letter is mysteriously started, after an office worker is choked
to death by a guy in a red ski mask with a piece of string, who steals
the letters and then mails some of them. What then transpires is a
whacky, and I do mean whacky story, not unlike a conspiracy theory, as
it offers comments on violence, sibling rivalries, paranoia, on both
heterosexual- and- gay relationships, and reasons why we shouldn't trust
our government, using the example of how it lied about the agent orange
use on our soldiers during the Vietnam War and how the government has
secret projects that it uses on the unsuspecting public to do its
unsavory experiments on, as these letters interconnect with the lives of
9 diverse characters, who some how or other connect with each other.</P>
<P>This is a Mark Rappaport film, so if you are expecting to see a
convential film, you have walked into the wrong theater. His
tongue-in-cheek humor is as always, delightfully absurd. All 9
characters play co-starring roles, with no one dominating the film. And
it works, in an odd sort of way, making the characters seem connected to
each other from the opening strangulation scene until the last scene,
even though there is no mention ever made in the movie again of the
opening murder.</P>
<P>This is a film about troubled characters and a chance for Rappaport to
direct his weird humor into the inanely funny lines spoken by them, as
each character is out of it, in a neurotic way. The characters appear in
short skits, trying to relate to each other in bursts of energy, spewing
out lame jokes and theories, self-absorbed with their own neurotic
tendencies, while many of them are hungering for sex and violence, and
answers to puzzles that they may not even be working on.</P>
<P>Paul(Mark) is seen at a wall map, discussing with Beth (Randy) a WW11
movie he saw, believing everything is planned out in life by a series of
dots, and life is simple if we can just understand the plan, which is
right under our noses, as it should have been for the Nazi general
depicted in the film he saw last night. He plays the part of a guy with
a screw loose after his Vietnam War days, who likes to screw women and
play out his paranoia until it is real. Beth thrives on sex. She is also
seeing Paul's brother, Phil (David), who is a college teacher,
expounding in the lecture she attends, about sharks who have within them
eggs called ovaphagos, which devour their own brothers in the womb. Paul
is also screwing Evelyn (Joan), who is Paul's main girl, but who in
contrast to Paul, sees life as a river flowing with the water muddied.</P>
<P>On a NYC train, Evelyn, who works in an architect's office, is leered at
by Steve (Dan), who is in business producing high tech security
products. Greg (Reed) is also aboard the same train car, and is gay, but
he also services ladies, and is not known to Steve, but he is the paid
stud for Steve's ex-wife, concerned about aging, Eva (Ellen), who works
as a research scientist, who has previously dated Phil, as her interest
in Phil is rekindled through the chain letter received. Eva and Beth are
sisters. Greg, through the courtesy of the chain letter, makes contact
with Phil, telling him that he knows that Phil secretly wants to have a
gay affair, which Phil acknowledges, just wondering how Greg detected
that about him, since he believes that he has so carefully disguised
that fact about himself.</P>
<P>Steve meets a former soap teenage star, Tracy (Marilyn), in the
supermarket, who is living with the macho, gun toting, black motorcycle
jacketed, Rick (Robert), who looks like Greg, and by coincidence, Greg
has met on the street, believing he might be secretly gay, and has
struck up a friendship with, hoping they can, at least, be best friends.</P>
<P>Steve has sex with the outspoken Tracy, and is presented with a t-shirt
that matches hers, "If it isn't stiff- it isn't worth a fuck," as the
sophisticated Steve reluctantly dons it to walk with her on the street,
where he surprisingly runs into the woman he was attracted to on the
subway, Evelyn, who turns out to be Tracy's sister, a sister that she
can't stand. After Tracy rips up the phone number her sister gives her,
Steve takes it from her and reassembles it to call Evelyn for a date.
After their date turns out to be cordial, but with no sex in the
offering, they part ways with a handshake; and, on the street, Rick guns
down Greg, because Greg has left him, and Paul, who hates Steve,
thinking he is having an affair with his Evelyn, spots them together in
the same street where Greg is shot, so he uses a high powered rifle to
kill Steve from the building he has positioned himself on, getting a nod
of approval from Rick.</P>
<P>That should cover enough of the plot for any one who needs to know what
he is seeing before he determines if he should venture out to rent this
on video. All I could honestly say, is that I enjoyed it. It was like a
nice cold drink, on a hot summer day, offering me something for my
thirst, as I wonder why there is not a greater market for original films
like this one, after all, the plot of this film is not completely
insane. And as Paul so ably says, "Everything is a plot, it is just not
clear what it is."</P>
