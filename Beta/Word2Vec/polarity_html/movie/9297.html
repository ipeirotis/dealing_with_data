<PRE>                    FAST, CHEAP, AND OUT OF CONTROL
                     A film review by Steve Rhodes
                      Copyright 1997 Steve Rhodes</PRE>
<PRE>RATING (0 TO ****):  ***</PRE>
<P>     Errol Morris is one of our most accomplished documentarians.  His
A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME explores the meaning of life and infinity
through the mind of the brilliant physicist Stephen Hawking.  His THE
THIN BLUE LINE investigates a possibly innocent man sentenced to death
for murder.  And finally, what some consider his best, GATES OF HEAVEN
examines people's feelings about a couple of California pet cemeteries.</P>
<P>     FAST, CHEAP, AND OUT OF CONTROL takes everything we know about the
construction of a documentary and twists it around in fascinating ways.
Rather than choose one subject, he picks four seemingly unrelated
topics and then interlaces and intertwines them.</P>
<P>     All coming loosely under the category of wild animals, the
subjects include a circus wild animal trainer (Dave Hoover), a topiary
gardener (George Mendonca), a mole-rat specialist (Ray Mendez) and an
MIT robot scientist (Rodney Brooks).</P>
<P>     The prerequisite for a good documentary filmmaker is a knack for
choosing the right subjects to interview, and all four of these look
straight out of central casting.  Each has his own quirks that make him
photogenic.  Dave has the rugged good looks of the Marlboro Man, George
has beady eyes from his meticulous work, Ray wears a butterfly bow tie
with his plaid shirt, and Rodney has wide saucer-like eyes when his
imagination goes wild.</P>
<P>     In a highly non-linear format, Morris keeps the audio from one
section going when he switches to the visual of another.  As Ray talks
about the colonizing habits of mole-rats, the most insect-like mammal,
the camera moves on to the circus performers and people in the stands.
Using such techniques he forms a bond between the disparate material.</P>
<P>     Another secret of the film's success is the use of an Academy
Award winning cinematographer, Robert Richardson (JFK).  Most known for
his collaboration with Oliver Stone, Richardson's work was one of the
best parts of Stone's most recent film U-TURN.</P>
<P>     "Its all done from memory," George says telling us his topiary
secrets.  "You know what an animal looks like, and you start making an
animal."  He has been working on the same garden almost forever.  The
spinster who owned the house and grounds died over twenty years ago,
but he keeps on tending her large and magnificent gardens.  Perhaps
because George has the only stationary animals in the story, I found
this part the weakest link.</P>
<P>     Better is the confident but ever cautious lion tamer.  Dave grew
up watching and worshipping Clyde Beatty, a real life animal trainer as
well as an actor in adventure B movies like THE LOST JUNGLE.  Morris
includes old black-and-white movie footage of Beatty fighting wild
animals as well as warriors incongruously dressed in Roman helmets with
large wings on their backs.</P>
<P>     "If you're not scared of them, you're in big trouble," Dave tells
us about his wild animals.  After relating one horror story after
another, he admits that most trainers never retire, and heart attacks,
not animals, kill most of them.  A funny guy, he explains the reason
lion tamers point the four legs of a chair at the lion.  "His mind is
distracted from his original thought - eat the man in the white pants,"
he says.</P>
<P>     The robot scientist has a simple approach to problems.  He likes
to find out what every one assumes and then negates it.  Everyone
assumes, for example, that one needs stability to walk.  After
observing ants who fall all the time but are highly mobile, he designed
a robot that could move by falling along.  The film's title comes from
his proposal for massive numbers of small robots for scientific
exploration.</P>
<P>     Rodney likes to build contraptions without knowing how they will
get along in their environment.  "If you analyze it too much, life
becomes almost meaningless," he says.  His goal is to "understand life
by building something that is lifelike."  His robots may have lifelike
mannerisms, but they resemble nothing in nature with the possible
exception of insects.  Their bodies of moving circuit boards are quite
a contrast to the interspersed science fiction footage of man-like
robots.  Ever the dreamer, Rodney talks of a future with twenty tiny
robots for a dollar, whose sole purpose would be to come alive and
clean your television whenever it is turned on.</P>
<P>     My favorite part was Ray's mole-rats.  Small moles without fur,
they live in large ant-like colonies.  Among their more bizarre habits
are what he calls their "Zen bowel movements."  Their feces are
normally hard, except when they have hungry children.  Their kids live
on a diet of soft feces, and the adults can control whether to emit the
hard ones or the soft ones.</P>
<P>     FAST, CHEAP, AND OUT OF CONTROL runs a fast 1:20.  It is rated PG
and would be fine for kids five and up, but younger ones might be
scared by the lions.  I recommend the picture to you and give it ***.</P>
<PRE><HR>**** = A must see film.
***  = Excellent show.  Look for it.
**   = Average movie.  Kind of enjoyable.
*    = Poor show.  Don't waste your money.
0    = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.</PRE>
