<PRE>Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz</PRE>
<P>The Shochiku Kamata studio specialized in nonsense comedies, something
the great director, one of the world's most acclaimed, Yasujiro Ozu (The
Tokyo Story/Late Spring/Floating Weeds) was keen on doing during this
period of his film career, when he refused to make talkies until
yielding in 1935, but continued to make silent social comedies, somewhat
in the style and equal to in quality to the Charlie Chaplin and Buster
Keaton films, though Ozu's films were seen through the eyes of children
rather than taken from the adult's point of view. They were ably
co-scripted by the master of the nonsense film, Akira Fushimi. In I WAS
BORN , BUT..., a film with lots of sight-gags, made as a social comedy
turning darker as the story got a bit more involved with the patriarch
of the family, Mr. Yoshii (Tatsuo Saito). This splendid example of a
salaryman's film, is the first great film of the master's, with many
others to follow. It is a film about the lower-middle-class
(shomin-geki) and it takes the form of a domestic drama, something Ozu
continued turning out for his entire film career, which spanned from
1927-1963. This life-long bachelor, ironically making family dramas,
passed away at the early age of 60.</P>
<P>The depression came to Japan in 1927 and continued into the 1930s. By
1932, one out of five unemployed workers was a salaryman, as the banking
system crashed. Haunted by the fear of unemployment, the Japanese worker
was a subservient figure, something that Ozu uses in this film to
exploit his comedy and satire of the human condition and comment on the
pecking order of society, where the rich remain in power, no matter
what.</P>
<P>The Yoshii family moves to the Tokyo suburbs, which places the lowly
clerk near the residence of his boss, Mr. Iwasaki (Takeshi Sakamoto),
which draws comments from Yoshii's fellow clerks how he moved there to
ingratiate himself further with the boss. The two Yoshii sons, the ten
year old (Hideo Sugawara) and the eight year old (Tokkan Kozo) have a
tough time fitting in with the other kids in the neighborhood, who pick
on these newcomers. Among the group is the boss's son, Taro (Kato) and
the big bully of the group, Keiji (Aoki). There is a comic sandal fight
among the boys, which brings out the film's visual humor from the way
the framing of the shots magnifies the synchronized reactions of the two
fighters. The bully takes away the puzzle-ring from the little brother,
but is baffled how to work it. The group scares the brothers so much,
that on the first day of school for the new students, they play hooky.
Since their father gave them a stern pep talk expecting them to get an
"E" on their work, with that letter standing for excellence, the boys
feel obligated to paint a picture to show their dad what they did in
school. But they do not feel capable of imitating how a teacher makes an
"E", so they get a parked beer-delivery truck's young adult driver to
forge the grade. He slyly puts an "F" there and smiles as he leaves the
students unaware of what he did. Before arriving home, the father runs
into the older boy's teacher, who acts concerned why the children didn't
show up for school. This results in a lecture by the father, that he
wants his sons to attend school and grow up to be great men, and after
being told the reason why the boys skipped school, he tells them that if
the gang bothers them again, just ignore them and they will go away. The
boys are not satisfied with this answer, but still look up to their
father. In fact, Ozu's camera angles for adults when talking to
children, are always taken from a higher elevation so that the adults
are talking down to the children, always in a position of superiority.</P>
<P>The older brother is the braver and more cunning one, and when he is
again confronted by the hostile boys, he realizes that today is payday
for his father and his mother (Mitsuko) can afford to buy some beer for
her husband. He tells the delivery man about this, who becomes very
pleased with the boys after the boys' mother bought six bottles of beer
from him. So when the older brother asks him as a favor to them, if he
can beat up the bully, he obliges them, sending the bully home crying.
But when he is asked to also beat up the boss's son, he tells them, no.
His family buys more beer than yours.</P>
<P>The boys when they return to school the next day, under the watchful
gaze of their father, find themselves being accepted by the group. Ozu
draws the analogy of the workplace power structure to the way children
naturally socialize, and states that the adults power is vindictively
social, derived from one's station in life and how much money one has.
Later on, the children are seen playing games together and the brothers
prove to be good at also being bullies and are telling the other
children that their father is greater than anyone else's. The game they
play is a mock power game of killing, by giving one the evil eye and the
other falls down pretending to be dead. They also comically cross
themselves in a parody of Christian ritual. But when Yoshii comes on the
scene and sees Taro lying on the ground, he quickly picks him up and
brushes him off, to the disappointment of the boys.</P>
<P>The question of submission becomes the motif of the film, as Yoshii is
seen by the boys bowing to Taro's father, and they don't understand
this. For them, Taro is not as smart or as strong as they are, so why
should their father submit to his father if he is the greater man.</P>
<P>That Yoshii was an inferior man was made clear to the adults in the
audience from the first scene on, where he is humiliated that his truck
got stuck in the mud and the boys have to push him out. And that before
he even gets settled into his new house, he runs over to his boss' house
and kowtows to him.</P>
<P>The film shifts gears and the comedy now becomes dark, as Yoshii is at
the boss' house watching home movies and the boys are also there as
guests of Taro, and what they see results in their loss of innocence.
The home movies become unbearably embarrassing to watch for Yoshii and
the children, as Yoshii acts the part of the clown in them and is seen
as an obviously inferior man than his boss. He is seen looking up to the
boss all the time and performing in order to please the boss. Yoshii,
himself, is embarrassed that he has to lower himself so much, but he is
secretly pleased that he is so successful as a clown and can make
everybody laugh. In the house, while watching the movie, he is doing
what he did on film, rushing to light the boss's cigarette and trying to
ingratiate himself to the boss in anyway he can. Taro's only comment is,
your father is really funny. But the boys can't take being in the same
room with their father anymore and run out of the house. Ozu' other
purpose of showing the home film, being always the gagman, it also gives
him a chance to parody his own way of shooting films by having the home
movie filmed in the same style he uses for this movie, such as by using
the same tracking shots and camera height angles. He even has some of
the boss's other guests yawning at parts of the movie where he shows
boats and cars.</P>
<P>Back in the house, the boys throw a tantrum, as they react to their
father's answers to their constant barrage of questions they hurl at
him. Asking him, why does he bow to the boss? The wry salaryman
responds, "If I didn't, I wouldn't get paid and you wouldn't eat." Ozu's
implications are clearly centered around the social use of power,
comparing the boys rise in stature into the neighborhood group of boys,
as being determined by who is tougher and smarter. The boys illusion is
that all power can be won through one's talents. But in the business
world, the boss doesn't have to possess those character traits, he is
the boss because that is the way society is structured, and it pays to
submit to that hierarchy or else you will be left out in the cold to
fend for yourself.</P>
<P>The childish reaction of the boys to all this, is that they decide not
to eat anymore. Here, the mother takes over the next day and cooks up
some delicious looking rice cakes for the boys to eat, which they
eventually will, and their father casually joins them, and there are no
more pretences about who he is, as they eat and talk in a natural
manner. When the father encourages them to keep going to school, to try
to become great people, he also asks the younger one what he wants to
become, and he says, "A lieutenant general." The father then says, "Why
not a general?" And he responds, "Because my brother will be the
general." And things seem to be back in order, everyone knows their
place in life and the sham of the father having to be regarded as a
great person is no longer carried out. The relationship is now an honest
one after the healing process is completed. The "but" in the film's
title comes into place, as it indicates that everyone is born equal,
"but" that changes soon enough. There is always something to disturb the
stability assumed from the outset. Ozu affirms the necessity of the
family sticking together to face these social challenges as the best
chance everyone has of making it successfully through life.</P>
<P>The only time we see the father and mother talking seriously together,
is after the children throw their tantrum, and she tells the
disconsolate husband, I hope the boys have a better life than we did,
and he takes out a bottle of whiskey, prepared to drown out his shame
and low conception of himself with forgetfulness, as he pragmatically
responds, "They'll  have to live with it all their lives." When he and
his wife check in on the sleeping brothers, they ask aloud, "Will they
lead the same kind of miserable lives we have?" It is now clear that
Yoshii grovels because he can't do anything else about it. And like many
parents in America, he only wishes his children have a better life than
he does, which draws him closer to the audience and presents him in a
more sympathetic light.</P>
<P>In the closing scene, after the reconciliation is made among the boys
and the father, the boys tell Taro that his father is the greatest and
now encourage their father to bow to Taro's father. And to further
emphasize the pecking order that exists and is realized by the no longer
innocent boys, the bully rushes down the street to make sure the teacher
sees him doff his cap. The plot of the film is encompassed within a
short five-day period, and it parallels in a didactic way the social
structure of the children and the grownups, and how in each group
adjustments have to be made in order to survive, with the majority of
the film being concerned about how the boys start growing up. The adult
world is mainly used as a expansion of the boys' limited horizons.</P>
