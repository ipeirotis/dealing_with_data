<P>     What would it be like if celebrated playwright and screenwriter 
David Mamet collaborated with Franz Kafka?  While we'll never know for 
sure, THE SPANISH PRISONER gives a good indication.  This film, the 
fifth to be authored and directed by Mamet (whose recent script 
contributions include THE EDGE and WAG THE DOG), is both a sendup of the 
Hitchcock-type thriller and a legitimate entry into the genre.  It's 
Mamet's most convoluted plot since HOUSE OF GAMES, but, while the 
overall structure and style are of noir twistiness, the underlying 
message is something almost any viewer can relate to:  how corporate 
greed destroys trust and corrupts honest men.</P>
<P>     Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) has just invented "The Process", a 
revolutionary procedure that is going to give his company control of the 
market (to use Hitchcock terms, this is the movie's McGuffin).  But, 
while Joe thinks his work is worth a sizable bonus, the corporation's 
president, Mr. Klein (Ben Gazzara), refuses to commit to a specific 
figure, assuring Joe only that his effort is appreciated.  While on a 
business trip to the Caribbean, Joe runs into Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), 
a mysterious, rich stranger who offers Joe a few tips about life and 
business.  Days later, in New York, Joe meets Jimmy again, and this 
begins his spiral into a strange world of deception, where nothing is 
what it first seems to be.  Soon, like so many heroes in films like 
this, he finds himself in an untenable position, wrongly accused with a 
pile of irrefutable evidence staring him in the face.  The only one he 
can trust is his secretary, Susan (Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife), who 
wants more than just a working relationship with him.</P>
<P>     Mamet's script supplies us with a seemingly-endless series of 
twists and turns, only a fraction of which are predictable. At times, 
the audience is a step ahead of the screenplay, but, most of the time, 
we're playing catch-up.  Although there are plenty of holes that Mamet 
has no interest is sewing up (trying to solve every riddle in THE 
SPANISH PRISONER is an exercise in futility), this is a smart film that 
develops a central character we can sympathize with – a modern version 
of Josef K. from Kafka's THE TRIAL.  The plot is delightfully 
preposterous, but holds together a lot better than the generic likes of 
PALMETTO and WILD THINGS.  The difference is simple:  those two films 
are for viewers who prefer to turn their brains off while THE SPANISH 
PRISONER is for anyone who likes to think and feel along with the 
characters.  Mamet offers us the same clues he gives to Joe; we can 
piece the truth together along with him.  </P>
<P>     The most curious thing about THE SPANISH PRISONER is the ending 
(which I will not reveal in this review).  At first glance, it appears 
to be a common wrap-up that ties together several critical loose ends.  
There's a deus ex machina aspect to it which may indicate that Mamet is 
toying with the audience by sending up the manner in which this kind of 
movie must end to satisfy an audience.  But are things as 
straightforward as they seem?  Is this, in fact, the end, or is it just 
the latest twist in an incredibly complex con game?  </P>
<P>     The dialogue is, of course, pure Mamet.  The writer/director's 
characteristic style infuses every exchange with its peculiar, staccato 
rhythm.  There are those who find Mamet's approach to be off-putting, 
but, for movie-goers who allow its strange allure to captivate them 
(which usually takes a few minutes), it becomes apparent how crucial it 
is to the film's overall tone.  One other thing worth noting – Mamet 
scripts are typically known for being extremely profane (see GLENGARRY 
GLENN ROSS or AMERICAN BUFFALO for examples), but there isn't a single 
curse word in the whole of THE SPANISH PRISONER.  Mamet has achieved 
something extraordinary – a PG rating.</P>
<P>     One of the reasons the film is so strong is that nearly every major 
performance is impeccable.  Campbell Scott is entirely sympathetic as 
the befuddled, naïve victim.  Joe is, by his own admission, a boy scout 
whose chief trait is courtesy and who is ill-suited to emerge unscathed 
from the labyrinthine trap laid for him.  Rebecca Pidgeon is captivating 
as Joe's outspoken, would-be seductress.  Despite Susan's assertion that 
she has "a secretary mentality," it's clear that nothing could be 
further from the truth, and Joe's statement that he's "not looking for 
an office romance" doesn't dissuade her.  Steve Martin plays Jimmy Dell 
with the right mix of charm and menace.  He's clearly a dangerous figure 
– but for whom:  Joe or Joe's enemies?  Effective support is provided by 
Ben Gazzara and Ricky Jay (as Joe's lawyer friend).</P>
<P>     Although most viewers of THE SPANISH PRISONER will be personally 
unfamiliar with the kind of sinister plot that Joe stumbles into, the 
concepts of corporate greed and backstabbing will hit closer to home.  
The subtext of this film is the same as the one in many other Mamet 
offerings – how the current business climate rewards those who act 
ruthlessly and punishes those who hold to a code of ethics.  With a plot 
that would make Hitchcock proud, THE SPANISH PRISONER uses this 
outrageously elaborate, always-entertaining approach to illustrate these 
more serious concerns about what it takes to survive the '90s.</P>
