This group method gets the results of the portions of the input text matched by the capturing statements in the regular expression. The matches are indexed from one-- to get the portion of the text matched by first capturing statement, you could query `result.group(1)`, the second parentheses will have its match stored in `result.group(2)`, etc. The value stored at `result.group(0)`, is the entire portion of the input string matched by the regular expression, not just the portion satisfying the capturing parentheses.\n",
